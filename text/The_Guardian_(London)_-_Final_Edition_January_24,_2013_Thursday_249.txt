* Eurosceptics talk of an European Union "democratic deficit", yet it's

precisely because we vote for our MEPs under a system of PR that Ukip has put

itself on the map. If we used first-past-the-post for the European parliament,

Ukip would never have got a look in. There would have been much less pressure

from the Tory right, and most likely no talk of a referendum.
