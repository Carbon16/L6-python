membership to rebuild and rebalance our economy, tackle the crisis in living

standards and give our young people a future". Well, good luck with that. The

EU's Eurostat agency reports average youth unemployment at a staggering 23.5%

across the 27 EU member states (24% in the 17-member eurozone). All the signs,

so familiar to British trade unionists since the 1980s, of a neoliberal economic

experiment destroying good-quality jobs and slashing the social wage in a

compulsive hunt for global competitiveness, are there. Far from turning their

back on austerity policies, the leaders of the EU last week announced a modest

extension of the timescale in which France's Socialist government must cut

public spending, coupled with a requirement for a wholesale scrapping of French

legislation that protects workers from hire-and-fire policies.



The answer to chronic unemployment will not be found in the EU, which binds its

members into low-wage and deflationary policies through successive treaties from

Maastricht to Lisbon that British governments have signed up to without a

referendum. Neither does a EU-US free trade agreement offer a break with these

policies, but opens Europe's public services up to US corporations seeking

profits from taxpayer funding. The fight against low-wage employment and

joblessness requires a fight against EU policies and structures, not collusion

in a discredited "European project".
