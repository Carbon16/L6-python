Tony Blair lambasted David Cameron's plan for an in-out referendum on Britain's

EU membership, warning metaphorically that the prime minister could end up

blowing out his brains by threatening to leave.



Blair told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: "It reminds me a bit of the Mel

Brooks comedy Blazing Saddles where the sheriff says at one point as he holds a

gun to his own head: 'If you don't do what I want I'll blow my brains out.' You

want to watch out that one of the 26 (other EU member states) doesn't just say:

'OK, go ahead.'"



He was most probably referring to a scene in the film where the sheriff (played

by Cleavon Little, above) does point a gun to his own head and threaten himself,

but it is in fact a brilliantly funny manoeuvre to allow him to escape from a

racist lynch mob. So if Blair is comparing Cameron to Little, what he is

actually suggesting is, as Little says to himself at the end of the scene: "Ooh,

baby, you are so talented! And they are so dumb!"
