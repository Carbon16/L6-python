The head of the International Monetary Fund has fuelled hopes that the European

financial crisis is easing by predicting the region will grow this year.



Christine Lagarde said she saw the "beginnings of recovery" in the eurozone,

currently in recession, as measures taken by individual countries and efforts to

stabilise the single currency union started to pay off. "It's clearly the case

that investors are returning to the eurozone, and resuming confidence in that

market," Lagarde told the BBC World Service yesterday.



Lagarde also predicted Greece would enjoy a better 2013 than expected, after "a

huge and massive effort" to cut spending and reduce its deficit. "The country is

going to turn out better results than what was even planned - but it has to

continue doing a massive effort on collection of revenue and collection of tax,"

she added.



Her comments echo optimism from the European Central Bank president, Mario

Draghi, and European commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso. They helped send

the euro up to 83.28p against the pound, its highest level since April 2012.

Traders blamed the pound's weakness on fears that Britain was heading into a

triple-dip recession and jitters over a referendum over Britain's EU membership.
