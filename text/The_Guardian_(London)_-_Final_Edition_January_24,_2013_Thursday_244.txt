So Cameron's going to give us a referendum on our membership of the EU "to let

the people decide" (Cameron to pledge in-out vote on EU, 23 January). A pity

this great democrat didn't give the people the opportunity to decide whether

they wanted this unelected coalition with its brutal attacks on the sick and

disabled, the unemployed and the old, the NHS and public services, and all the

other measures they have taken to make the poor pay to preserve the privileges

of the wealthy who were responsible for the state we're in. The truth is his

stance on the EU is designed, first, as an attempt to plaster over the divisions

within the Tory party and stave off Ukip; but second and more importantly, to

turn people's minds away from the disastrous consequences of his government's

punitive welfare cuts and its incompetence in dealing with the country's

economic difficulties.



Our democracy would be far better served by a general election this year to give

the people the right to decide now on whether or not to legitimise the coalition

and its policies, not by Cameron's attempts to create a smokescreen to conceal

the government's failures.
