So now we have Cameron's long-trailed speech on the EU, largely to assuage Tory

MPs and his party, in an attempt to fend off the Ukip threat. It's worth

remembering that the most fundamental changes in the relationship between the UK

and the EU (and its predecessors) have occurred under Tory PMs. These were:

entry into the common market in 1973, under Edward Heath; the Single European

Act of 1986, extending qualified majority voting, under Margaret Thatcher; and

the Maastricht treaty of 1992, which lead to the EU and the euro, under John

Major. None of these PMs sought approval of these changes through a referendum.



Mr Cameron may be following the Wilson referendum tactic of 1975, but he is now

dealing with 26 rather than eight other members of the EU and unlike the 1970s

has no incentive to offer any face-saving gifts. Mrs Thatcher was out of office

two years after her key 1988 Bruges speech on the future of Europe. Is the

London speech of Mr Cameron a portent?
