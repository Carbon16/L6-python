*I wonder if Messrs Gove, Hammond et al have considered the possible effects on

the "British" motor industry of a withdrawal from the EU. In France, Renault and

PSA Peugeot Citroen have declining home sales and therefore overcapacity, and

are closing lines and shedding jobs; Citroen's Rennes plant ceased production

earlier this year. Since 1999, Renault has had a 44% share in Nissan and already

assembles its vans in France. According to the Renault CEO, the Renault-Nissan

Alliance is "beginning to bear fruit" and the French press reported a couple of

weeks ago that, from 2016, the Renault plant at Flins, outside Paris, would use

spare capacity to build the next generation of Nissan Micra cars. The current

model is produced in India and the one before that in . . . Sunderland.



The Conservative party plans a referendum on leaving the EU sometime after 2015.

What might strategists at Nissan and the other Japanese carmakers who have their

European operations based in the UK be thinking about that?
