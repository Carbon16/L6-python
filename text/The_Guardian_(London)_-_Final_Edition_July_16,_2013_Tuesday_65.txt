It is not quite a million-dollar question, but economists have a new euros

100,000 topic to tackle - a thinktank is putting up the cash prize for the best

plan for Britain's exit from the European Union.



The Institute of Economic Affairs launches its Brexit Prize today, saying that

"we need to give serious consideration to how the UK could have a prosperous

economy outside the EU given that exit is a serious possibility after the next

election".



The free-market thinktank is inviting entries from individuals and groups and

will award the first prize of euros 100,000 to the best blueprint for the UK

after leaving the EU. Entrants are asked to imagine a referendum has resulted in

an "out" vote and the government has triggered article 50 of the Lisbon treaty.



The judging panel will be chaired by former chancellor Lord Lawson, who recently

claimed the British economy would be better off outside the EU.



The IEA said there was an urgent need to explore the implications for Britain of

a so-called Brexit. The thinktank's Philip Booth said: "The judges believe that

exit from the EU should lead to an outward-looking, freely trading Britain and

not an inward-looking Britain trying to shore up domestic markets and vested

interests."



It is inviting 2,000-word submissions by a 16 September. A shortlist will then

be given more time to submit between 10,000 and 20,000 words to the judging

panel, which includes historian David Starkey and Labour MP Gisela Stuart.



The Brexit prize follows a similar competition run by the thinktank Policy

Exchange to find the least disruptive way to organise a breakup of the euro. The

Â£250,000 Wolfson Prize went to economist Roger Bootle, from Capital Economics,

who is now on the IEA's judging panel.
