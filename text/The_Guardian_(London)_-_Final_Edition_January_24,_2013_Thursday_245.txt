* What a wonderful contrast. Here in the UK we have a prime minister being led

by the nose by his unruly backbenchers and fear of Ukip to offer a referendum on

leaving the EU, while the French president is addressing a joint session of the

German Bundestag and the French National assembly in Berlin (Paris and Berlin

feeling the 50-year itch, 23 January). Europe has its problems - no political

system can ever be perfect - but co-operation as epitomised by the event in

Berlin is surely the better way. Standing on the sidelines and griping, as

Britain seems constantly to do - under both Tory and Labour governments - does

nothing for our interests. There is no viable future for Britain outside of the

EU. If only we would recognise that and embrace our fellow European countries as

our friends and neighbours. The alternative is to be an irrelevant small island

off of the coast of the continent.
