As a seasoned political reporter, Nicholas Watt should know that last Friday's

Commons vote on the holding of an EU referendum was far from unanimous

(Unanimous backing for referendum on EU as most Labour MPs abstain, 6 July). A

unanimous vote would mean all MPs present voting in favour. They did not.

Friday's motion was passed nem con. I haven't been a minutes secretary for

nothing.
