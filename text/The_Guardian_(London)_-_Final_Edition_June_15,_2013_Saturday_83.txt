Michael Adler writes: I had the great pleasure of working with Sir Patrick

Nairne (obituary, 6 June) as a fellow trustee of the National Aids Trust.

Despite the many calls on his time, he read every paper in detail and always

offered sharp analytical comments, seeing through difficult problems with ease.

When I came to chair the trust, I relied on him as a friend and adviser.



Patrick's beautifully crafted post-meeting letters discussed what had happened

and what should happen. His italic script was a joy, and put my doctor's writing

to shame. I am the proud owner of one of his watercolours, which he gave to me

as a wedding present.



Richard Jameson writes: Patrick Nairne was responsible for administering the

1975 referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. As an

undersecretary from the Department of Education, I was seconded to head a

referendum unit of six people under his supervision in the Cabinet Office,

responsible to Ted Short (then lord president of the council), for the four

months between Harold Wilson's decision and the vote itself. The work included

passing an act through parliament and supporting secondary legislation, as well

as a host of administrative decisions. Without the leadership of Short and

Nairne, the vote would not have taken place on 5 June 1975.
