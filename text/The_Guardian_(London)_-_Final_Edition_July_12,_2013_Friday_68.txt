* Tim Ottevanger correctly pointed out the error in your report that last

Friday's Commons vote on holding an EU referendum was not passed unanimously,

but wrong in claiming it was passed nem con (Letters, 8 July). This is an

abbreviation of nemine contradicente, meaning that no one spoke against, not

that no one voted against. According to Hansard, Douglas Alexander, among

others, spoke against and 30 voted against. Yes, I know I should try to get out

more.
