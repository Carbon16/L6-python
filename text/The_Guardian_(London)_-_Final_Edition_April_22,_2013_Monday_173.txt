Five hundred British business leaders, including Ocado chairman Sir Stuart Rose

and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have backed a campaign urging David Cameron to

negotiate a new deal for the UK with Brussels.



The Business for Britain campaign, whose supporters range from blue chip firms

to small companies, has backed the prime minister's approach to renegotiation

and called for a cross-party "national drive to renegotiate the terms of

Britain's membership of the EU".



Cameron has pledged to claw back powers and then offer voters a choice of

staying in the EU in a referendum by the end of 2017, if the Conservatives are

returned to power at the next election.



Business for Britain's co-chairman Alan Halsall, who is also the head of

Yorkshire pram-making firm Silver Cross, said: "Business for Britain has been

formed because many would have you believe that business doesn't want

politicians to try and renegotiate a better deal from Europe."



Retailer JML's founder John Mills, a Labour supporter, said: "This campaign is

not about taking political sides or backing the right horse - it's about doing

what's best for British business.



Other signatories include Lord Bilimoria from Cobra beer, Richard Burrows from

British American Tobacco, hairstylist John Freida, Lord Harris from Carpetright,

Moni Varma, the rice tycoon and John Clement from Littlewoods.
