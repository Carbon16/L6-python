Vernon Bogdanor is right that referendums are justified on proposals to change

the way in which we are governed, but wrong to conclude that "Labour must back

this vote" (Comment, 28 January). No one in the UK, the other member states or

the EU institutions is seeking treaty amendment or any alteration to governance

of the UK. This vote has nothing to do with such profound issues. David

Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum in several years' time, on issues

yet to be identified and negotiated, by a government yet to be elected, has not

been made in pursuit of legitimacy or certainty or, indeed, democracy. It is

because he is more willing to risk the wellbeing of the UK as an investment

location than to face down the militant Europhobes in his party.



Labour, as Professor Bogdanor says, was "formed to combat the power of elites".

That is why there is strong support in the UK and other EU labour movements for

the major advances in working conditions and rights, environmental standards,

consumer protection, improving banking rules and supervision, and many other EU

achievements. Many of those obligations on employers and business are also among

the prime reasons for Tory anti-EU zeal. Professor Bogdanor and others who

support sustained UK engagement in the EU should recognise that, resist the

siren call of Cameron's referendum and focus on stopping his reckless wheeze by

beating the Tories in 2015.
