*The current political squabble about membership of the EU is being conducted

with far too narrow a focus on economic costs and benefits. The European project

was initiated after the second world war to try to ensure that no more land wars

would devastate our lives and communities. The period since 1945 has seen the

longest interval without military conflict between France and Germany since the

mid-1630s. Given that the UK found itself unable to keep out of most European

land wars between 1635 and 1945, it would be a serious mistake to discount the

consequences of narrow nationalism. Figures on the Guardian website suggest that

EU membership, on average, costs UK citizens about Â£150 per year, of which about

half comes back into the UK economy. Even if it cost us each Â£1,000 per year, in

exchange for long-term security in a war-free zone, it would be a bargain.
