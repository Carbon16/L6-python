It was the coup that never was. Rumours had been circulating in Westminster that

with the Tories behind in the polls, a challenger could take on David Cameron.



Yesterday morning, a name emerged from the shadows in two right-leaning

newspapers - and it was not Boris Johnson, Michael Gove or any of the big names.



It was Adam Afriyie, the suave multimillionaire MP for Windsor, who within hours

was rather keen to insist he had no designs on Downing Street as a "stalking

horse candidate" if the Tories fail to deliver a majority government in 2015.



Both the Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Times had claimed he had a campaign team

in place and backbenchers were being asked to sign a pledge of support in

expectation of a future leadership challenge.



After several hours of speculation, Afriyie appeared on Sky News to say he had

held regular talks with colleagues "about the long-term future of the party" but

rejected suggestions he was being lined up as part of any plot to oust its

leader.



"I will never stand against David Cameron, I am 100% supportive of David Cameron

and I am working with many colleagues but to make sure we give the Conservatives

the best chance of winning . . . the 2015 election," he told Sky News.



"When you are working with an organised team to try to achieve something

positive for the party and for David Cameron, it is inevitable that all sorts of

rumours leak out. There is no truth to any of it."



The newspaper reports and Afriyie's qualified denial of them, will concern No

10. The prime minister's supporters have been trying to argue this week that he

has won over the parliamentary party with a promise for a future EU referendum.



Afriyie, who is worth Â£50m-Â£100m, grew up in poverty in Peckham, south-east

London, the son of an English mother and a Ghanaian father. Elected in 2005, he

was the first black Tory MP.
