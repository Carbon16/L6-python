The\n\nEuropean court of human rights ruled that the Greek state compensate Constantine\n\nfor a fraction of the Â£320m he had sought.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, however, Constantine struck lucky when he sold his north\n\nLondon mansion for Â£9.5m. By contrast, property prices in Athens have plummeted\n\nto the point where flats are selling for as little as euros 6,000 (Â£5,000) in\n\nthe city centre.\n\n\n\nThe former monarch has repeatedly denied political ambitions.\n\n\n\n",

In other EU nations, enthusiasm for the concept\n\nof Europeanism is far higher.\n\n\n\nOpinium found that just 26% of British voters regard the EU as, overall, a \"good\n\nthing\" compared with 42% who say it is a \"bad thing\". In Poland 62% say it is a\n\ngood thing and 13% bad; in Germany 55% good and 17% bad, and in France 36% good\n\nand 34% bad.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the UK's contribution to the EU, there is little enthusiasm\n\namong our partners, and little to suggest they will go out of their way to keep\n\nus in. Just 9% of Germans and 15% of French people think the UK is a positive\n\ninfluence on the EU, with more Poles, 33%, taking that view.\n\n\n\nOnly 16% of Germans and 26% of French people back the idea of a special deal\n\nbeing struck for the UK. Cameron has said he intends to renegotiate the UK terms\n\nof entry and hold an in/out referendum if he wins a majority at the next\n\nelection, offering the new arrangement to the British people in a referendum.\n\n\n\nThe idea of Britain leaving the EU does not appear to worry our European\n\npartners unduly. Just 24% of French voters said a UK exit would have a negative\n\neffect, compared with 36% of Germans and 51% of Poles.\n\n\n\nLast night Rifkind said: \"There needs to be a serious debate about the real\n\nbenefits of - as well as the real problems about - British membership of the EU.\n\nWithout it we could do serious damage to Britain's interests.\"\n\n\n\nClegg said next year's European elections represented a key test and attacked\n\nthose intent on taking Britain out of the EU. He said: \"Everybody knows the EU\n\nneeds reform. But simply carping from the sidelines and flirting with exit\n\nundermines British leadership in the EU, fails to deliver reform and leaves\n\nBritain increasingly isolated. The debate about Europe is no longer about who is\n\nfor or against reform - everybody agrees on that - it is between those who\n\nbelieve we can lead in the EU and those who want to head for the exit.\n\n\n\n\"That's why next year's elections will be so important: the Liberal Democrats\n\nwill be the leading party of 'in'. It's time we challenged Ukip and large swaths\n\nof the Conservative party who want to betray Britain's vital national interest\n\nby pulling us out of the world's largest borderless single market, on which\n\nmillions of jobs depend.\"\n\n\n\nLabour MP and former Europe minister Peter Hain urged pro-Europeans to stand up\n\nand fight: \"This is a wake-up call for British pro-Europeans that Britain -\n\nespecially if the Tories win the next election - is heading for an exit from the\n\nEU which would be an utter disaster for British jobs, prosperity and influence\n\nin the world. But it is equally a wake-up call for the Brussels Bubble, which is\n\ntotally out of touch with Europe's citizens.\"\n\n\n\nThe poll shows concern about immigration to be almost as high in France as in\n\nthe UK. In Britain, 64% of voters think the EU's immigration policies have a\n\nnegative effect; 59% say the same in France.\n\n\n\nIt also reveals that more UK voters feel an affinity with the US than with their\n\nEuropean neighbours, whereas our EU partners tend to choose other EU nations.\n\nWhen asked who they would generally support on occasions when there was a\n\ndisagreement between the US and EU countries, 37% of UK respondent said they\n\nwould tend to support America; just 10% would generally side with Europe.\n\n\n\nBritish people are not negative about everything the EU does: 54% think free\n\nmovement rules are good for tourism against 6% who think the reverse. There is\n\nalso strong endorsement for free-trade benefits. Nearly half of those polled say\n\nthe absence of customs controls and tariffs on goods and services is an\n\nadvantage. Only 10% see free trade as a disadvantage.\n\n\n\nUkip leader Nigel Farage said: \"This is a fascinating and comprehensive study\n\ninto the relative relationships between countries within and about the EU. We,\n\non these islands feel, due to our history as a globally trading nation, much\n\nmore at home with our cousins in the Anglosphere than we do with our friends on\n\nthe continent.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nFormer foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind: 'We could do serious damage to\n\nBritain's interests.'\n\n\n\n",

Two months ago, the Germans gave Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats\n\n41.5% of the vote. Her nearest rivals, the Social Democrats, got 25.7%. However,\n\nMerkel hasn't been able to get herself elected chancellor yet. She is still\n\nnegotiating with the losers about forming a coalition. And the losers are\n\ndictating the agenda.\n\n\n\nWelcome to proportional representation. This, together with the fractured nature\n\nof the electorate, ensures that the composition of governments is decided in\n\nbackroom deals. Since Merkel couldn't gain an absolute majority, and since she\n\nlost her previous coalition partner - the liberal Free Democrats, who were voted\n\nout of parliament - she has to form a coalition with the Greens or the Social\n\nDemocrats, the very people she claimed in the election would ruin the country.\n\nThe Greens declined; the Social Democrats agreed to negotiate.\n\n\n\nSecond, welcome to Merkel's modus operandi, which is to let things drift until\n\nthe last moment. The coalition talks are to be wrapped up tomorrow, and still\n\nnobody knows who will get what, and how much of the wish list the negotiators\n\nhave drawn up will make its way into Merkel's programme.\n\n\n\nAnd third, brinkmanship. Sigmar Gabriel, the SDP leader, has promised his party\n\nthat the coalition agreement will be subjected to a plebiscite of the party rank\n\nand file.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, in democracies the people elect their government, right? Well, not in\n\nGermany. Two months ago, the Germans gave Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats\n\n41.5% of the vote. Her nearest rivals, the Social Democrats, got 25.7%. However,\n\nMerkel hasn't been able to get herself elected chancellor yet. She is still\n\nnegotiating with the losers about forming a coalition. And the losers are\n\ndictating the agenda.\n\n\n\nWelcome to proportional representation. This, together with the fractured nature\n\nof the electorate, ensures that the composition of governments is decided in\n\nbackroom deals. Since Merkel couldn't gain an absolute majority, and since she\n\nlost her previous coalition partner - the liberal Free Democrats, who were voted\n\nout of parliament - she has to form a coalition with the Greens or the Social\n\nDemocrats, the very people she claimed in the election would ruin the country.\n\nThe Greens declined; the Social Democrats agreed to negotiate.\n\n\n\nSecond, welcome to Merkel's modus operandi, which is to let things drift until\n\nthe last moment. The coalition talks are to be wrapped up tomorrow, and still\n\nnobody knows who will get what, and how much of the wish list the negotiators\n\nhave drawn up will make its way into Merkel's programme.\n\n\n\nAnd third, brinkmanship. Sigmar Gabriel, the SDP leader, has promised his party\n\nthat the coalition agreement will be subjected to a plebiscite of the party rank\n\nand file. It's a bit like David Cameron promising a referendum on EU membership\n\nin the hope that this will force the other member states to give him what he\n\nwants.

The payment, to persuade\n\nVasella not to use his knowledge to help rival pharmaceuticals, was described as\n\na \"golden gag\".\n\n\n\nThere followed a huge public and political backlash, with the Swiss justice\n\nminister, Simonetta Sommaruga, saying the payoff was \"a huge blow to the social\n\ncohesion in our country\" and that payouts on such a scale \"undermined public\n\ntrust in the entire economy\".\n\n\n\nNovartis was forced to cancel the payout. But serious damage was done, and in a\n\nreferendum the following month more than two-thirds of Swiss voters backed a new\n\nrule to ban golden hellos and goodbyes\n\n\n\nLast month, the authorities paved the way for another vote, which could\n\nintroduce a minimum wage for the employed and unemployed alike. Further\n\nreferendums are planned on inheritance tax and the taxation of wealthy\n\nforeigners.\n\n\n\n\"In recent years, we've seen high salaries get higher while other salaries have\n\nstayed at much the same level, especially in terms of ordinary people's\n\ndisposable income,\" said David Roth, the organiser of the 1:12 campaign. \"It has\n\nbecome obvious that something is wrong.\"\n\n\n\nBut his arguments are contested by others. The free market thinktank Avenir\n\nSuisse concluded in a recent study that the crucial difference was not between\n\nthe salaries of individuals, but between the incomes of households - and that\n\nsince more women had joined the workforce, that gap was narrowing.\n\n\n\nWhat no one disputes is that top executives' salaries have skyrocketed. One of\n\nJuso's most striking posters shows the change in the ratio of the average salary\n\namong Swiss CEOs to the average wage. In 1984, it was six to one. By 2011, it\n\nhad reached 43 to one.\n\n\n\nWhat is more, said Roth: \"The biggest salaries are in the same places as the\n\nbiggest problems. Take UBS. The state has had to pour money into UBS because of\n\nproblems caused by the very people who earned the highest salaries. Last year,\n\nthe bank lost SFr2.5bn - and paid out SFr2.5bn in bonuses.\"\n\n\n\nHis opponents see the pay campaign as a potentially catastrophic assault on the\n\nunderpinnings of one of the world's freest economies.\n\n\n\n\"Deciding on wage levels is not a matter for the state,\" said Rudolf Minsch of\n\nEconomiesuisse, an umbrella organisation of Swiss firms. \"It is one of the key\n\ncompetences of every enterprise. And the freedom of enterprises to determine\n\nwages is a key reason for Switzerland's success.\"\n\n\n\nThe country is blessed with a jobless rate of 3%; the average in EU-member\n\nstates its 11%. And, says Minsch, \"A flexible labour market is the main driving\n\nforce behind low unemployment in this country.\"\n\n\n\nHe argues that one of the most important reasons for Switzerland's success has\n\nbeen the freedom its companies enjoy to negotiate pay locally, adapting to\n\nsignificant differences in the living standards of its 26 cantons. Adopting the\n\n1:12 rule would mean imposing a restriction at national level for the first\n\ntime, setting what Minsch believes would be a hazardous precedent.\n\n\n\nOpponents say the move could also prompt Swiss firms to outsource their\n\nlowest-paid jobs in order to bring their CEOs' salaries under the new ceiling.\n\nBut, said Roth: \"You would need to outsource - outside of Switzerland - every\n\nsingle low-paid job in the firm concerned. And you just can't do that. You can't\n\noutsource the work of a bank teller or a shop assistant to India.\"\n\n\n\nAnother fear is that curbs on executive pay would drive out foreign companies.\n\nOne of the best-known is in the FTSE 100: the mining and trading firm Glencore\n\nXstrata.\n\n\n\nSwitzerland might be better off without multinationals like that, said Beat\n\nRingger of the thinktank Denknetz. \"They are in countries where the conditions\n\nfor workers are poor and the governments are often corrupt. I am sure that\n\nsooner or later the international community is going to want to regulate these\n\nthings and that Switzerland will come under international pressure as a result\n\nof having these companies on its territory.\"\n\n\n\nGlencore Xstrata has its headquarters in the canton of Zug where corporate tax\n\nis limited to 15.4%. For Ringger, \"Switzerland is like a 5-star hotel giving\n\naway its best suites for nothing. The biggest companies and the richest\n\nindividuals get to stay here without paying much tax and without being much\n\nregulated.\"\n\n\n\nLast month polls were suggesting the vote on 1:12 rule could be close, but in\n\nrecent days the no campaign - backed by the government and parliament - appears\n\nto have turned the tide. A survey for Swiss television released on Wednesday\n\npointed to a 54% to 36% defeat for the proposal, with 10% so far undecided.\n\n\n\nRoth complains that \"our adversaries have mounted a campaign, in which some of\n\nthe media have become involved, aiming to stir up fear\".\n\n\n\nBut for Ringger, big business is blackmailing the rest of the population. \"They\n\nare saying: 'If you do anything to harm our interests we will harm you.'\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nProtesters in Zurich with a cutout of Sergio Ermotti bearing a placard that\n\nreads, 'As UBS boss I earn as much as all these people together'.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope is once again turning into a disaster for the Conservatives. The prime\n\nminister is up for renegotiation and an in-out referendum: indeed it is his\n\nidea. Implicitly, if renegotiation fails, we should leave. But as David Cameron\n\nbegins to realise the price of this promise in investment and jobs, he is\n\ndesperately trying to reassure business that he can win a plebiscite backing EU\n\nmembership.\n\n\n\nThe big guns are pounding. Last week a CBI report estimated that every British\n\nhousehold was Â£3,000 better off from membership, and urged that we stay. It\n\nrejected a Norwegian or Swiss half-pregnant option where you apply the rules but\n\nget no say over making them. Four-fifths of businesses backs EU membership,\n\naccording to polls.\n\n\n\nOn Friday Nissan's most senior global executive said his company would\n\nreconsider its UK investment if we left. The company employs 6,500 people in the\n\nnorth-east. These warnings could cost the Tories votes in manufacturing areas\n\nwhere there are marginal seats.\n\n\n\nThe Conservatives, once the business party, are in the fevered grip of activists\n\nwho have no conception of what matters to the economy or indeed the electorate.\n\nAmbitious Tory MPs know how to stroke their party's erogenous zones, which is\n\nwhy the MP Adam Afriyie is playing games in calling for a referendum next year,\n\nbefore the election.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday the Bruges Group, whose principal purpose is to keep a candle\n\nflickering at the altar of St Maggie, held a conference in London entitled\n\n\"Which way out? How Britain can withdraw from the EU\". The Tory right is busy\n\nplotting the how, not the why.\n\n\n\nThis is lunacy. The EU is simply incapable of being the bogeyman the Tory right\n\nand the UK Independence party try to put up. Its institutions are small: they\n\nemploy 47,500 people, 11% of the size of the UK civil service. EU spending is 1%\n\nof EU output, or less than a 40th of total public spending. EU law is usually\n\nmind-bogglingly technical, and largely about establishing common standards.\n\nWithout that effort, differing consumer protection can block trade. Unlike any\n\nother institution designed to tackle cross-national problems, the EU even has\n\nelected officials.\n\n\n\nNor does the electorate give a toss. Our EU membership does not even rank in the\n\ntop 10 issues concerning voters. In an Ipsos Mori poll in September, just 1%\n\nsaid it was the most important issue facing Britain, compared with 25%\n\nspecifically citing the economy. Even Ukip-Tory switchers worry more about\n\nimmigration and the economy than about EU membership. Yet Tory activists are\n\nobsessed with the issue.\n\n\n\nHow can we explain this? The Tories are a mix of two strands. The first is the\n\nwhiggish, market-oriented and socially liberal strand. The second is the old\n\nTory English nationalist tradition: militaristic, authoritarian and xenophobic.\n\n\n\nThat English nationalist strand runs all the way through Tory history: the\n\narchetypal leader in that tradition was Lord Salisbury. As a result, the Tory\n\nparty has always needed a foreign bogeyman: the French until the entente\n\ncordiale in 1904, the Germans until 1945, and the Soviet Union until the fall of\n\nthe Berlin wall in 1989.\n\n\n\nWhen the Soviets could no longer credibly perform the role of foreign threat,\n\nwho should volunteer but Jacques Delors, then European commission president and\n\na French socialist who proclaimed to the Trades Union Congress in September 1988\n\nthat there had to be a \"social Europe\". As the commission's campaign for its\n\n1992 Maastricht treaty gathered strength, the Tory right had its enemy.\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson, then the Daily Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, performed his\n\nown walk-on role in the transformation by inventing an entirely new - and\n\nlargely fictitious - brand of journalism known as the \"bent-banana story\". The\n\nstory, in many guises, held that the EU was about to legislate some daft law\n\nthat would threaten a way of life enjoyed by free-born Englishmen since King\n\nEthelred.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the EU offers a prize that has been the objective of English foreign\n\npolicy since the Tudors. We were a small trading nation that wanted to stop any\n\ndomination that would close our continental markets. We spent blood and treasure\n\nfighting the Spanish, French and Germans to achieve that objective. Now the EU\n\ngives us what we always craved - and the Tory nationalists look the gift horse\n\nin the mouth.\n\n\n\nPity the redundant Tory nationalist, because we live in a period with fewer\n\nexternal threats to our existence than at any time in our history. But the need\n\nfor a foreign bogeyman does not depend on reality: it is a psychological urge\n\nthat tells you more about the person who holds those views than about the world.\n\n\n\nThis psychosis is a massive problem for Tory leaders. Cameron should have faced\n\ndown these demons in opposition, just as his hero Tony Blair faced down the\n\nnationalisers with the abolition of clause IV from Labour's constitution. The\n\ntragedy for the Tories - and for Cameron's project - is that he never did.\n\n\n\nWorse, he threw red meat to rightwingers with a promise in his leadership\n\ncampaign to withdraw from the European People's party, the pro-EU grouping that\n\ncontains the sane continental conservative parties.\n\n\n\nCameron now lacks the courage to refuse more of the concessions that he began.\n\nLike so many leaders before him, he is a sad hostage to the way he won.\n\n\n\nChris Huhne was a cabinet minister from 2010-12 and is a former Lib Dem MEP\n\n\n\n",

He said that a referendum next October would allow the Tories\n\nto draw a line under Europe, allowing them to hold a \"straight fight\" with\n\nLabour on the economy at the 2015 general election.\n\n\n\n\"This Friday you will have the opportunity to vote for a 2014 EU referendum,\"\n\nAfriyie wrote in his letter published on the Guido Fawkes website. \"This will be\n\nthe last moment to try to hold an EU vote within this parliament.\"\n\n\n\nAfriyie's letter continued: \"This is Conservative MPs' last chance to try to\n\nsecure a referendum. If we do not take this opportunity, we risk sleepwalking to\n\nelection defeat by driving votes to Ukip.\"\n\n\n\nBut the letter makes clear that Afriyie, who has failed to secure more than a\n\nhandful of supporters for his amendment, is struggling. He wrote: \"I urge you to\n\nvote for this amendment.

At its annual\n\nconference in London, the group will stress that benefits such as easier access\n\nto export markets, both in Europe and further afield, easily outweigh the costs.\n\n\n\nPresenting his \"business vision for a reformed EU\", CBI director general John\n\nCridland countered those calling for a so-called \"Brexit\" by stressing that\n\nbeing outside the world's largest trading bloc would leave the UK isolated.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron has promised to put Britain's EU membership to a vote in 2017. The\n\nreferendum has caused huge controversy inside the Tory party, which is split\n\nbetween those MPs who are pushing the prime minister for a vote before the 2015\n\nelection and a faction led by the former chancellor Ken Clarke, who has\n\ndescribed the vote as silly and reckless.\n\n\n\nThe CBI's research could strengthen Cameron's hand inside the Tory party,\n\nespecially as it found that more than three-quarters of small and medium-sized\n\nbusinesses back staying inside the single market. Traditionally, polls have\n\nshown large majorities among large businesses for EU membership against a large\n\nno vote from smaller enterprises.\n\n\n\nCridland said: \"We have looked beyond the political rhetoric to examine the pros\n\nand cons of EU membership and British business is unequivocal: the single market\n\nis fundamental to our future.\"\n\n\n\nThe group's conclusions credit membership of the bloc with giving Britain access\n\nto European markets of 500 million people, helping cement the UK as the world's\n\nleading financial centre and attracting investment from around the world. It\n\nsays that by aggregating research already available it has come up with a\n\nconservative estimate that the benefits amount to 4-5% of GDP, or as much as\n\nÂ£78bn a year, making each household Â£3,000 better off.\n\n\n\nBut the group also outlines a number of frustrations. \"The EU isn't perfect and\n\nthere is a growing unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. Europe\n\nhas to become more open, competitive and outward looking if we are to grow and\n\ncreate opportunities and jobs,\" Cridland said.\n\n\n\nThe group is calling on the EU to fully implement a market for services and to\n\ncreate a digital one, and also to secure trade deals with the US and Japan as\n\npart of talks already under way. It also wants a moratorium on legislation where\n\nthere is a case for decisions to be made at national level, such as employment\n\nlaw.\n\n\n\nCaption:\n\n\n\nCBI director general John Cridland said departure from the world's largest\n\ntrading bloc would leave Britain isolated\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nFor centuries, Britain has developed economically through being an open,\n\noutward-looking country. Today, the economy has a high level of global\n\nintegration. The UK is the world's fifth largest exporter of goods and services,\n\nand we attract more foreign direct investment than any other European country.\n\n\n\nWhile I am more worried than Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England,\n\nabout the risks of becoming over-reliant on financial services for growth, I do\n\nacknowledge that 60% of City-based firms are in London because of the single\n\nmarket, and that is important to defend because of Britain's ability to\n\ninfluence its rules.\n\n\n\nHowever, it is clear that the UK's future prosperity will require us to adapt to\n\nnew realities. Over recent decades we have seen a rapid shift in the centre of\n\ngravity of the world economy. The combined GDP of emerging economies has already\n\novertaken that of the west, and the gap is widening. Meanwhile, new technologies\n\nare creating demand for greater investment in skills and infrastructure and\n\nmaking it easier to relocate supply chains overseas.\n\n\n\nThere are fantasists on the right who dream of a lost world of global empire and\n\nbelieve we can walk away from the successful trading block on our doorsteps. The\n\nopposite is true. We should take careful note of today's report by the\n\nConfederation of British Industry, which stresses the importance of continued EU\n\nmembership. Eight out of 10 firms surveyed said they would vote to stay in the\n\nEU if there was a referendum tomorrow. The report estimated that each British\n\nhousehold derives annual benefits of about Â£3,000 a year from EU membership.\n\nThat compares with an annual net contribution per person of just over Â£110 to\n\nthe EU budget.\n\n\n\nSignificantly, the report concludes that far from acting as a constraint, the EU\n\nserves to anchor the UK's global trade. By being part of a group that is\n\npursuing an outward-looking approach to trade, it is easier for British firms to\n\nexport and invest internationally. The best way to retain the UK's place as a\n\ncompetitive economy is to work with like-minded European countries to maintain a\n\nliberal approach to trade. There is now the prospect of a significant trade and\n\ninvestment deal with the US, which could bring as much as Â£10bn to the UK\n\neconomy, and comparable trade agreements with Japan and India. By harnessing the\n\ncollective weight of the EU as the world's largest exporter, importer and\n\ninvestor, there is the prospect of far better deals for British exports than we\n\ncould ever hope for alone.\n\n\n\nCloser to home, we have to take the lead in completing the EU single market in\n\nservices and the digital and telecoms sector. Britain's 220,000 online retailers\n\nalready export more than the rest of Europe's e-retailers combined. Bringing the\n\nEU single market into line with the internet age will allow us to build on these\n\nstrengths and open up a market of 500 million consumers to our online companies.\n\nFor those who complain about continental Europeans in our mix, it has to be\n\npointed out that the single market embodies four freedoms: trading goods and\n\nservices and freedoms of movement for capital and workers. That is what free\n\ntrade means.\n\n\n\nThere are, of course, regulatory barriers to business within the EU - as indeed\n\nthere are nationally. There is no justification for jettisoning important\n\nenvironment, worker and consumer protections, but of course regulation should be\n\nproportionate and moderate. The need for such reform is widely recognised across\n\nEurope. The CBI report is a compelling business-based argument for the UK\n\nremaining an active member of the EU. Millions of jobs and livelihoods depend on\n\nit.\n\n\n\nVince Cable is a Liberal Democrat and secretary of state for business,\n\ninnovation and skills\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish politics is hardening. The post-conference opinion polling reported by\n\nthe Guardian yesterday shows a strengthening in Labour and Tory numbers - both\n\noverall, and in terms of determination to vote. To the extent that this is a\n\nnational snapshot, the nation is falling out of love with the idea of coalition.\n\n\n\nThis is cheering for Ed Miliband and his decision to take on the energy\n\ncompanies - polarising, provocative \"socialism\" that the country seems to rather\n\nlike. But the new dynamic offers Miliband the biggest tactical dilemma of his\n\nlife. His answer could define British politics for years ahead - and it's got\n\nnothing to do with the cost of living, one nation or hard-working people. It's\n\nabout Europe.\n\n\n\nThe return to left-right politics, which squeezes the Lib Dems, leaves the\n\nTories still facing their biggest problem: Ukip. Nigel Farage's party is as much\n\nan angry annexe of the Conservative family as a new phenomenon. Combined with\n\nunreformed constituency boundaries, Ukip voting in 2015 is still likely to rob\n\nCameron of any chance of an overall majority. If Miliband continues to radiate\n\nan unnatural sense of calm, Ukip is an important part of the cause.\n\n\n\nYet there is one argument that could yet save Cameron's bacon and deliver a\n\nConservative majority, and it's a simple one, which won't gain full currency\n\nuntil after next year's European elections: \"Vote Ukip, get Labour\" (because\n\nsplitting the Tory vote would let Labour in). Rightwing voters are desperate for\n\na European referendum but are bitterly hostile to Miliband; so the Tory message\n\nthat if you want a referendum, you must vote Conservative will have a lot of\n\nresonance. So far Labour is talking about a referendum only if there is a major\n\ntransfer of powers to Europe. But could that change?\n\n\n\nOf all the big tactical plays ahead, this is the big one. You haven't heard much\n\nabout it yet, but this is a very hot issue wherever key Labour people get\n\ntogether in private. The influential backbencher Tom Watson said recently on\n\ntelevision that he might support the Tory rebels' call for an early referendum.\n\nHe is not alone.\n\n\n\nAnd of course all of this goes way back in Labour history. The ghosts of Barbara\n\nCastle and Peter Shore, never mind Hugh Gaitskell (and, for much of his life,\n\nHarold Wilson), were never quite exorcised by the New Labour Europhiles. It was,\n\nafter all, Labour who gave the country the first European referendum.\n\n\n\nImagine the impact if Ed Miliband turned round now and made the pledge.\n\nHard-core rightwing voters would be free to vote with their hearts and Nigel\n\nFarage; Cameron would have lost his key line of defence to his right. The Tory\n\nparty would be further ripped apart as hardcore Europhobes strove to respond by\n\ntrying to bring the referendum forward. Cameron's careful policy of a nuanced\n\nrenegotiation followed by a 2017 referendum with all the main parties lined up\n\nin favour of staying in, would collapse. Sensation! If Ed thought he was\n\ngarnering some unexpected media support after his move on electricity prices,\n\nthis would take him into a whole new league.\n\n\n\nYet this is an Alice in Wonderland story, in which nothing is quite what it\n\nseems. Imagine that Labour commits to a referendum, wins the election, and then\n\ndelivers its promise. At this point, of course, Ed Miliband has neither tried\n\nfor a renegotiation with Europe nor delivered one. The eurozone is still mired\n\nin low growth and high unemployment. With the British right having just lost,\n\nand seething, I just don't see how a referendum could be won for the\n\npro-European cause.\n\n\n\nSo . . . a new Labour prime minister inherits the aftermath of a no vote.\n\nWhatever your views about the EU, the first thing that happens is economic\n\nmayhem. Big companies decamp to Frankfurt or Paris. The pound falls. Many of our\n\nexporters have no idea what's going to happen to them, and the banks aren't keen\n\nto gamble in their favour. This would be an economic storm so big it could\n\novershadow anything else the new government would be trying to do. Ed would be a\n\none-term, unsuccessful prime minister.\n\n\n\nMiliband will be all too aware of the risks involved. But he's receiving\n\ndifferent advice from people in his party. If Miliband went for a referendum, he\n\nwould win a short and spectacular tactical victory but at the price of yet more\n\nbloody battles between the remaining Blairites and the current Labour\n\nleadership.\n\n\n\nIt isn't worth it. As it happens, and perhaps paradoxically, I'd like to see a\n\nEuropean referendum. I've been arguing about this with friends for weeks - but\n\nwhat I don't want to see is Labour rushing into a referendum promise, which\n\nwould result in us pulling out of Europe shortly after Ed Miliband reaches\n\nDowning Street.\n\n\n\nSo in the end, all this is about confidence and the will to govern. If Miliband\n\ngenuinely thinks that he has the policies, the character and the disciplined\n\nparty to win a general election in 2015, then he will not offer an early\n\nreferendum. It's only if he really doesn't think he's going to make it without a\n\nradical reshaping of the political landscape that he's going to be tempted. You\n\nwant to know what's really going on inside Ed's head? This is the decision you\n\nneed to watch for.\n\n\n\njackie.ashley@theguardian.com\n\n\n\n",

If the Blairites are tough on public\n\nspending, their founding father was not, for quite a lot of the time.\n\n\n\nBut who are the Blairites? David Miliband is often cited as one. Yet he came to\n\nregard the war in Iraq as a \"disaster\" and was moved from his role as head of\n\npolicy in No 10 because he was not regarded as Blairite enough. He was replaced\n\nby Andrew Adonis, who is often seen as the leading Blairite. Adonis is an\n\nadmirer of Blair, but his hero is Roy Jenkins, more recognisably a social\n\ndemocrat and a passionate opponent of military intervention in Iraq. As a highly\n\neffective cabinet minister Adonis nationalised a train company, developed plans\n\nfor high-speed rail and is now an advocate of an active industrial policy that\n\nwould have worried early Blair and perhaps later Blair too, on the grounds that\n\nit might be seen, wrongly, as a return to the 1970s.\n\n\n\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, is sometimes described as a\n\nBlairite. Yet when Blair was prime minister he spoke critically and insightfully\n\nabout the dangers of \"Blairite exceptionalism\", the idea that a party supposedly\n\non the centre-left can only win with a leader who seeks definition against it.\n\nAlexander was the architect of the Commons' vote against immediate military\n\naction in Syria, an act that alarmed Blair. The Blairite Alexander disagreed\n\nwith Blair on one of the most contentious issues of recent times.\n\n\n\nThere are self-proclaimed Blairites in the Conservative party too. Michael Gove\n\nnever loses the opportunity to declare that he is one. Yet Gove recently told a\n\nBBC interviewer that if there were a referendum now on the UK's membership of\n\nthe EU he would vote to leave. Blair is such a passionate supporter of British\n\nmembership of the EU that he hoped to become its president. On another of the\n\nbiggest issues of our times, the Blairite Gove is at the opposite end of the\n\nargument to Blair.\n\n\n\nRecently I read that Nick Clegg is the Blairites' new hero, and yet the Blairite\n\nAdonis is a staunch critic of Clegg, regarding him as a Conservative.\n\nNonetheless Clegg speaks, like Blair, of his support for social justice and\n\neconomic competence. But then again part of Blair's genius was to make the banal\n\nseem profound. The key debate for those who delve more deeply is over the means\n\nto agreed ends. More widely there are big differences between the two. Blair was\n\nan authoritarian in some respects, supporting a series of measures that\n\nconstrained civil liberties. Clegg's support for civil liberties is such that he\n\nhas put the eccentric Norman Baker in the Home Office. When Clegg stood in for\n\nCameron at prime minister's questions he made waves by describing the war in\n\nIraq as illegal.\n\n\n\nIn the media there is an army of Blairites, but study them closer and the same\n\nmaze of divergent views arise. Blair's biographer John Rentoul is seen as the\n\nultimate Blairite. Yet Rentoul is a Eurosceptic who believes that Ed Balls'\n\nKeynesian interpretation of economic policy in 2010 was broadly correct.\n\n\n\nThere are some in the Labour party who agree more with Cameron and Osborne than\n\nwith Miliband. They are on the centre-right without quite realising it. But a\n\nlot of those mentioned here have moved on from the 1970s and 80s, the\n\nelection-losing decades that shaped Blair's approach to politics. None of them\n\nare Blairites, not even Blair.\n\n\n\nSteve Richards is author of Whatever It Takes, a study of New Labour\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n&#10002;So many are nervous about the prospects for fracking in Britain. What is\n\nthe potential, what are the dangers? Difficult choices, but none of this seems\n\nto be keeping energy minister Michael Fallon awake at night. He seems to be\n\nquite enjoying everyone else's agony.\n\n\n\nTwo months ago he was joking about the prospects for fracking in the south-east,\n\nsuggesting quite a few \"rectory walls\" might bear the brunt. More recently he\n\nwas to be found undermining once again PM Dave's claim to run the greenest\n\ngovernment ever. When Fallon, speaking at a party conference fringe meeting,\n\nmentioned the UK's \"strong environmental and climate change commitments\", a\n\nheckler shouted: \"Scrap them!\" To which Fallon quietly replied: \"It would be my\n\nluck to scrap them.\" Which raises the question, is this the sort of thing he\n\nsays when he meets Cuadrilla, the fracking company? Hard to tell, and there is\n\nno point asking his department. Responding to a freedom of information request,\n\nthe Department of Energy said it \"can confirm that Mr Fallon met Cuadrilla on 24\n\nJune 2013\". But it can't confirm anything that was said because \"there is no\n\nrecorded note of the meeting\". Seems a strange way to deal with a matter quite\n\nso sensitive. But he probably cracked more jokes, as is his way.\n\n\n\n&#10002;More bloodletting in the Tory party as the stalking horse that never\n\nwas, Adam Afriyie, breaks cover again to cause PM Dave discomfort by calling for\n\nan early EU referendum. This provokes much angst and a measure of backbiting\n\namong honourable members, each of them figures of high principle. Take Philip\n\nDavies, the Tory MP for Shipley. He's one of our favourites as you know, as\n\nparliamentary spokesman for the Campaign Against Political Correctness and the\n\nman who wonders why anyone complains when white performers black up. According\n\nto the Sun, one of his favourite mouthpieces, he's taking a sensible approach to\n\nAfriyie's latest intervention. Davies, said the paper, criticised Afriyie, but\n\nalso admitted he could support him. \"I think he's being utterly self-indulgent\n\nand trying to boost a leadership bid.\" Nevertheless, \"I believe in a referendum\n\nso I'm not saying I won't vote for it.\" This is why he is so dear to the good\n\nfolk of Shipley.\n\n\n\n&#10002;Another firm diary favourite, Dr Liam Fox, also finds himself harshly\n\nspotlighted. Hard hearts let it be known to the scurrilous press that the\n\npotential party leader claimed 3p on his expenses for a 100-metre car trip.\n\nExtraordinary that such an event should occur, especially as he once boasted to\n\nauthor Dominic Shelmerdine that, unlike his colleagues, his medical training\n\nbestowed upon him \"a sense of perspective, something that is sadly all too\n\nlacking in politics\". A beacon indeed. Would that they all could see the world\n\nlike him.\n\n\n\n&#10002;One never tires of a literary feud, and luckily there seems to be an\n\nendless supply. Generating both heat and light of late, the fisticuffs between\n\nSalman Rushdie and the American Jonathan Franzen. \"Franzen has recently attacked\n\nyou for using Twitter,\" said the French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, in\n\nconversation with the great man. \"I feel like I've been bitten by a mosquito,\"\n\nreplied a waspish Rushdie. \"No, seriously, he's a very good writer. But I think\n\nhe should mind his own business. Of course he has every right not to appreciate\n\nsocial networks. If he doesn't want to use Twitter, that's his affair. But let\n\nhim not come and tell me what I ought to be doing!\" Salman has been pushed\n\naround enough for one life, it seems.\n\n\n\n&#10002;Interesting times, finally, for Jon Benjamin, the British ambassador to\n\nChile. A lot on his diplomatic plate, including the country's role combatting\n\nclimate change, opening the channels for British business, and bolstering our\n\nsteadfast attitude towards the Falklands. And then for Our Man in Chile, there\n\nwas that bilateral meeting with the black-eyed biter of bat's heads, Ozzy\n\nOsbourne. Benjamin has been tweeting about it and parading the picture. \"How to\n\nsum up a Black Sabbath gig in one word,\" he says. \"LOUD! But a conversation with\n\nOzzy - not loud.\" Heroes fall short in all sorts of ways.\n\n\n\ndiary@theguardian.com\n\n\n\nTwitter: @hugh-muir\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nA rebel Tory plot to force David Cameron to hold an EU referendum next year\n\nbackfired yesterday, after it was pilloried by most Conservatives.\n\n\n\nAdam Afriyie, the Conservative MP for Windsor, called for a vote on Britain's\n\nmembership of the European Union on 23 October next year, rather than the\n\nofficial Conservative promise to hold a poll before the end of 2017.\n\n\n\nAfriyie, who was rumoured to be behind a plan to oust the prime minister earlier\n\nthis year, said he would not be able to sleep at night if the public were not\n\ngiven a say on the issue before the election. To achieve an early vote, he is\n\nplanning to table an amendment to the EU referendum bill, which is supported by\n\nthe Tory leadership.\n\n\n\nWithin hours, it became clear he had hit the wrong note, as some of the most\n\neurosceptic MPs in the party pleaded with him to reconsider his position for the\n\nsake of unity. The only vocal supporter was Tom Watson, the Labour backbencher\n\nwho said he would probably vote with Afriyie. \"I think there are a lot of people\n\nwho think we need clarity on this now,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Labour party also refused to rule out backing the amendment, despite Chuka\n\nUmunna, the shadow business secretary, saying the party does not agree with the\n\nTory plan for a referendum on the basis of a renegotiation on Britain's\n\nrelationship with the EU that has not yet happened. Labour has refused to set\n\nout its thinking on whether an EU referendum is necessary but it is possible Ed\n\nMiliband could use Afriyie's amendment to derail the bill.\n\n\n\nAsked how Labour will vote, a senior party source said: \"We will respond to the\n\namendment after it is published.\"\n\n\n\nSome Labour figures believe backing an early vote could cause bitter divisions\n\non the Tory benches before the election as well as settling the issue once and\n\nfor all. One of the party's MPs also pointed out any parliamentary time spent on\n\nAfriyie's amendment increases the chance the Conservative-backed EU referendum\n\nbill will be \"talked out\". This is the technical term for when legislation\n\nproposed by a backbencher is killed off because it has run out of its allotted\n\ntime for discussion.\n\n\n\nAfriyie's challenge, laid out in an article for the Mail on Sunday, also gave\n\nLabour another chance to accuse the Conservatives of dithering over Europe when\n\nthey should be addressing the economy and living standards.\n\n\n\nMichael Dugher MP, a shadow cabinet minister and Labour vice-chairman, said it\n\nwas a sign \"the Tories are back to obsessing about the European Union\".\n\n\n\nAfriyie's amendment provoked a furious reaction from the Conservative\n\nleadership, with Downing Street saying a referendum would not be allowed to take\n\nplace next year \"under any circumstances\".\n\n\n\nTheresa May, the home secretary, also slapped down the plan, telling the BBC's\n\nAndrew Marr Show, \"Adam's got it wrong\" and could \"possibly jeopardise the\n\nbill\".\n\n\n\nYesterday, dozens of Tory MPs lined up to criticise Afriyie for disrupting the\n\nshort-lived Conservative consensus on Europe.\n\n\n\nCheryl Gillan, a former Conservative cabinet minister, warned Afriyie's move\n\nwould play into Labour's hands.\n\n\n\n\"I do take issue with him taking this up at this particular time,\" she told the\n\nMurnaghan programme on Sky News. \"I think he's jumping the gun here. I think\n\nLabour would be very happy for this referendum to take place next year because\n\nthey wouldn't have to make a decision.\"\n\n\n\nChris Heaton-Harris, MP for Daventry, said he had only been in parliament three\n\nyears, but knew the Afriyie amendment would \"make a referendum less likely\",\n\nwhile Nick de Bois, MP for Enfield North, who wants to leave the EU as things\n\nstand, said the timing was wrong.\n\n\n\n\"No government can hope to influence and reach agreement with EU members on a\n\nrenegotiated, less intrusive but more pro-single market European Union within a\n\nyear,\" he wrote on the ConservativeHome website. \"Neither can we hope to\n\nstimulate public engagement that will help to decide if we leave or remain.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah Wollaston, MP for Totnes, said she thought it would \"scupper\n\nopportunity for renegotiation\".\n\n\n\nAfriyie stuck to his argument that a referendum before the election is needed\n\nbecause the British public is \"suspicious\" about whether it will happen.\n\n\n\n\"This is about every MP searching their conscience and asking: do they want to\n\nagree with 80% of the population who want a referendum in the bag,\" he told Sky\n\nNews. \" This is nothing to do with me and David Cameron. It is to do with me and\n\nmy conscience, making sure that I, as a backbench MP, make sure that parliament\n\nhas the option to decide whether to have a referendum in 2014.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nAdam Afriyie, denies political ambition.

They follow the resignation of transport minister Simon Burns, who wants\n\nto stand as deputy Commons speaker.\n\n\n\nRandall, who has served in the Tory whips' office for 13 years, said he informed\n\nthe prime minister last year that he wanted to return to the backbenches. He is\n\nbest known for his role in the resignation of his boss, Andrew Mitchell, the\n\nformer chief whip, over the \"plebgate\" scandal just over a year ago.\n\n\n\nIn his resignation letter, Randall assured the prime minister that he would\n\ncontinue to do \"whatever I can for you personally as well as for the party, the\n\ngovernment and of course the country\".\n\n\n\n\"I know that it is customary to write at these times that it has been a great\n\nprivilege and honour to serve as a member of the government, but it really has\n\nbeen that and a lot more,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\nCameron's reply to Randall was glowing, describing him as a \"rock\" for the\n\nwhips' office and the party. \"It sounds dramatic, but I had rather hoped this\n\nday would never come,\" Cameron wrote. \"I could not have wished for a more loyal,\n\ndiscreet, patient, trustworthy and committed colleague over the last eight\n\nyears.\"\n\n\n\nSmith, a Cabinet Office minister, is stepping down to concentrate on her\n\nconstituency work and engaging young people in politics. The 31-year-old MP, who\n\nhas previously served as a whip and a Treasury minister, has recently been\n\noverseeing the lobbying bill, which has been criticised as posing a potential\n\nthreat to freedom of speech. She was moved from the Treasury in the last\n\nreshuffle after a difficult interview on BBC Newsnight about the chancellor's\n\ndeferral of fuel duty.\n\n\n\nLast night, Smith, the MP for Norwich North, told the Guardian: \"It's entirely\n\nmy own decision and something I see as very positive. Anyone who has known me\n\nand my work has known that my constituency comes first. I've spent three of my\n\nfour years serving as a minister. I'm very proud of that and achieving things\n\nlike helping to save Â£10bn pounds of Whitehall waste. But for now I want to\n\nfocus on the things that really matter to me.\"\n\n\n\nIn her letter to Cameron, she said: \"As you know, I was only 27 when I was lucky\n\nenough to be elected as an MP. I would welcome the opportunity to develop other\n\nways of giving public service, both inside and outside parliament, while\n\ncontinuing to work hard for my constituents.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister's reply said Smith has served \"ably\" and made a \"positive\n\nimpact\". \"I know this will not have been an easy decision for you to make, and\n\none you will have given a huge amount of thought to,\" he said. \"After serving\n\nthe government so ably for over three years, you will certainly be missed, but I\n\ncompletely understand and respect your decision.\"\n\n\n\nThe Tory reshuffle could happen at the same time as Ed Miliband shakes up the\n\nLabour frontbench. He is thought to be considering moving Andy Burnham, the\n\nhealth secretary, and Liam Byrne, the work and pensions secretary, with Rachel\n\nReeves, a Treasury minister, tipped for promotion.\n\n\n\nThe news came at the end of an embarrassing day for the Tories, as a rebel plot\n\nto force Cameron to hold an EU referendum next year was rejected by most\n\nConservatives. Adam Afriyie, the Conservative MP for Windsor, called for a vote\n\non Britain's membership of the European Union next October, pre-empting the\n\nofficial Tory promise of a poll before the end of 2017.

He\n\nsaid Cameron was best-placed to secure a referendum on Britain's EU membership,\n\nand called on Tories to \"work flat-out\" to help the prime minister win a\n\nmajority at the next election that would \"cut that Liberal Democrat albatross\n\nfrom around our necks\".\n\n\n\nBut Johnson made a joke at Cameron's expense as he recalled a visit by Alain\n\nJuppe, who was mayor of Bordeaux while serving as French prime minister. \"That\n\nis the kind of thing they do in France - a very good idea,\" he said, before\n\nadding: \"Joke, joke, joke, joke.\"\n\n\n\nJohnson addressed the conference after Cameron said he would warmly welcome the\n\nmayor's return to parliament in 2015 even though his second term at City Hall\n\nruns until 2016. The prime minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he\n\n\"could make a very strong team together\" with Johnson, despite all the\n\nspeculation about the mayor's leadership ambitions.\n\n\n\n\"I've had this conversation with Boris and my message to him is: 'You're a\n\nbrilliant mayor of London, you've done a great job, you've got a lot more to\n\ngive to public life and it would be great to have you back in the House of\n\nCommons at some stage contributing to public life.' But that's up to him, but\n\nI'll certainly be giving him a warm welcome.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether Johnson could stand again while still London mayor, Cameron said:\n\n\"Absolutely, but that's a matter for him, it's his plan, so all I know is that\n\nhe's a massive asset to the country, a big asset to the Conservative party, we\n\ncould make a very strong team together, we do today. Obviously, this is all\n\ndependent on what Boris wants to do, whether he wants another term, whether he\n\nwants to become an MP. I think he's got an enormous amount to give to public\n\nlife and I don't think he's given up on that either, so we're quite\n\nwell-aligned.\"\n\n\n\nD'Ancona, author of In It Together and a former Spectator editor, told Today:\n\n\"There had to be a concordat between Boris and Cameron sooner or later. You can\n\nsee the lineaments of one emerging now.\n\n\n\n\"Cameron is clearly not only accepting the idea that Boris might come back as an\n\nMP in 2015 but actually encouraging it. He is hugging him close. There is a\n\nlogic in this. It is better to be seen to be in favour of something that is\n\nprobably going to happen anyway than to be against it and then watch it happen\n\nagainst your will.\"\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Johnson was generally supportive of Cameron. But he made clear he\n\nwould not budge on his opposition to a third runway at Heathrow and his belief\n\nin the need for a larger hub airport in the Thames estuary. George Osborne hopes\n\nto prepare the way for a third Heathrow runway by setting up a commission that\n\nwill report after the election.\n\n\n\nJohnson said: \"If we persist with the Heathrow option we will wreck the quality\n\nof life for millions of Londoners, we will constrain London's ability to grow\n\nand we will allow the Dutch to continue to eat our lunch by allowing Schiphol\n\ninto the hub for London.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron watches Boris Johnson's speech.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n'Tories: back to the workhouse.\" So screamed the front page of yesterday's Daily\n\nMirror, the self-described \"intelligent tabloid\". It's a commonplace that\n\npoliticians are divorced from the real world. But there's no bigger divide than\n\nbetween the public, who see for themselves the effects of excessive welfarism\n\nand foot the bills, and metropolitan commentators, who regard all welfare\n\nprovision as beyond criticism.\n\n\n\nFor too long growing public concern about excessive levels of immigration and\n\nwelfare dependency was ignored by mainstream parties. It is partly from this\n\nvoid that Ukip has risen. It is a mistake to believe that the party is some kind\n\nof provisional wing of shire conservatism. Ukip is appealing to voters from\n\nacross the political spectrum.\n\n\n\nThe correct response for the Conservative party is to address the concerns of\n\npeople who are anxious about their jobs and living standards. That means\n\ndistinguishing between disaffected voters and the demagogues who are appealing\n\nto them. We need to speak for people who are worried about their future, not\n\nagainst them. Policies to control immigration, reform welfare and reduce taxes\n\naren't a sudden response to an insurgent minority party. They are core to a\n\ngovernment that puts itself on the side - to coin the Conservative party's\n\nconference slogan - of hard-working people.\n\n\n\nBut there are far more voters to win back who have moved to Labour, or away from\n\nall parties, than to Ukip. That is one reason why the suggestion of a pact with\n\nthe minority party is so misguided. Nigel Farage complains he is regarded as a\n\n\"plague carrier\" by Tory high command because he is refused entry to the\n\nConservative party conference. But it would indeed be political death for\n\nConservatives to open the door to him.\n\n\n\nThe first obstacle is a glaringly obvious policy difference. Ukip want to leave\n\nthe EU come what may. That is not Conservative party policy, which is to\n\nrenegotiate Britain's terms of membership and put a better deal to the public in\n\na referendum. And while Ukip now offers a small menu of populist, frequently\n\nincredible policies, its gravitational pull is to talk ceaselessly about Europe,\n\nwhich would be disastrous for Conservatives when Europe is relatively low on\n\nvoters' concerns.\n\n\n\nThere are other reasons to reject Farage's overtures. Ukip is an angry party. It\n\noozes a loathing of contemporary Britain. It is backward-looking and\n\nisolationist. A bargain with Ukip would be Faustian, the opportunity of wider\n\nappeal sold for illusory political gain. Like two bitter old bores drinking\n\ntogether in a pub, no one else would want to talk to us.\n\n\n\nIt's true that the Conservative party needs to reach out beyond its core to\n\nobtain a winning share of the national vote, but the overture should be to\n\nelectors in the north, to women, to ethnic minorities, to a generation who are\n\nworking ever harder for seemingly less reward.\n\n\n\nThis is the grand coalition that Conservatives must forge. At its most powerful\n\nthe party has appealed beyond the shires to the cities, to those who want to get\n\non as much as those who have already succeeded, to the young as well as the\n\nelderly. It has captured an optimism about our country, rewarded aspiration and\n\nchallenged privilege.\n\n\n\nThe spring in the step of Conservative activists this week comes from a sense we\n\nare winning the big argument about the economy. Ultimately a debate about living\n\nstandards will run best for the party which can offer a credible path to\n\neconomic growth, jobs and rising incomes.\n\n\n\nConservatives should realise that we have a powerful hand to play. We are\n\nsetting out policies which can speak to anxious voters and win them back. We\n\nshould not be deterred by shrill claims that to address the electorate's biggest\n\nconcerns, such as welfare dependency, is to abandon the middle ground. Nor\n\nshould we be spooked into any kind of deal with a minority party that would\n\ndrive moderate voters away.\n\n\n\nNick Herbert is Conservative MP for Arundel and South Downs\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nConservative MPs have been banned from teaming up with Ukip at the next\n\nelection, as Nigel Farage claimed more than 20 Tories would like to stand on a\n\njoint ticket.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron was forced to rule out any prospect of local pacts or deals after\n\nthe Ukip leader gatecrashed the second day of the Conservative conference.\n\n\n\nDespite drawing large crowds, including several Conservative MPs, Farage's\n\nattendance in Manchester was overshadowed by a fresh race row.\n\n\n\nGawain Towler, a Ukip aide and MEP candidate, described a British Asian female\n\nreporter as being \"of some form of ethnic extraction\" in a text message sent to\n\nthe wrong person.\n\n\n\nHowever, the party shrugged off the incident as a mistake, Towler said he had\n\nbecome \"today's comedy racist\" and Farage insisted it was \"not meant\n\nmaliciously\".\n\n\n\nThe Ukip leader was banned from the main conference venue and airbrushed from\n\nthe schedule, but several Conservative MPs pleaded with Cameron to \"work\n\ntogether\" with Ukip to keep out Labour.\n\n\n\nTheir pleas came as the Bow Group thinktank suggested Ukip could be bigger than\n\nthe Tories within five years at its current growth rate.\n\n\n\nOne Eurosceptic Tory MP, Bill Cash, shared a platform with Farage and begged him\n\nto \"lay off\" his assault on 60 Conservative marginal seats that could be lost if\n\nUkip's poll surge continues.\n\n\n\nCash asked Farage to stop fielding candidates against Tories as they should be\n\n\"allies, not enemies\" given their common aim of having an EU referendum.\n\n\n\nHowever, Farage dismissed this \"hopelessly out-of-date, tribal\" view, as Ukip\n\nbelieves it will get enough Westminster seats to hold the balance of power and\n\ndemand a referendum in 2015.\n\n\n\nHe said it was not in Ukip's interest for Cameron to get a second term as the\n\nprime minister treated Farage's supporters like \"members of the lower orders\".\n\n\n\nHe said no Ukip candidate would stand aside for a Tory, unless local parties can\n\nstrike formal \"joint ticket\" agreements with potentially sympathetic MPs such as\n\nNadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\n\n\nThe Ukip leader later said his \"eclectic\" band of supporters would be deeply\n\nunhappy if he ever \"sold out\" by agreeing to go easy on Conservative candidates.\n\n\n\nHe declined to say whether he would prefer Ed Miliband or David Cameron to be in\n\ncharge, but said he had \"some time in many ways\" for Boris Johnson.\n\n\n\nFarage's presence appeared to infuriate senior Conservatives, with Cameron,\n\nGeorge Osborne, Theresa May and Grant Shapps all forced to bat away the idea of\n\njoint Tory-Ukip tickets.\n\n\n\nOsborne said: \"There aren't going to be any deals with Ukip and there are not\n\ngoing to be Conservative-Ukip candidates locally. The only candidates who will\n\nstand for the Conservative party at the election are Conservative candidates - a\n\nsort of statement of the obvious.\"\n\n\n\nLynton Crosby, the Conservative election guru, also made it clear the party will\n\nnot respond to Ukip's offers.\n\n\n\nAsked how the party would react to the threat of Ukip, he told the BBC in a rare\n\ninterview that there would be no change in policy as a result of Farage.\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson, the London mayor, appeared to take Farage's presence in better\n\nhumour, as he joked \"you kip if you want to, David Cameron's not for kipping\".\n\n\n\nOne MP, Anne Main, stormed out of Farage's first speech, saying she would not\n\nlisten to \"this rubbish\" and accusing him of \"party political stunts\".\n\n\n\nOthers were much more interested in Farage's offer. Douglas Carswell, MP for\n\nClacton, wrote on the Telegraph website that he is \"strongly in favour of Ukip\n\nand Conservatives working together where they share the same vision of an\n\nindependent Britain\".\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nUkip leader Nigel Farage canvasses for party candidate Glyn Wright in a council\n\nbyelection in Weaste, near Salford, yesterday Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty\n\nImages\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been said that in the original Holy Trinity of Tory modernisers Michael\n\nPortillo is the Father, Michael Gove the Son and Francis Maude, the Holy Spirit.\n\n\n\nPortillo has fled the field, Gove is wrestling with \"the blob\" of the education\n\nestablishment, but Maude remains, keeper of the modernising flame.\n\n\n\nYet a cursory scan of the announcements at the upcoming Tory conference -\n\ncrackdowns on welfare and immigration - might suggest this is not a golden age\n\nfor modernisers. The shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander claims the\n\nconference will represent \"the final nail in the coffin of Conservative\n\nmodernisation\".\n\n\n\nA tax break for married couples is likely to be one of the policy highlights,\n\nthe kind of traditional social judgment that was anathema to modernisers.\n\n\n\nDriven to the right by austerity, his backbenchers and the threat of Ukip, David\n\nCameron has appointed the Australian pollster Lynton Crosby to run his 2015\n\ncampaign - the man who ran the 2005 campaign which Maude then went on\n\nsubsequently, as party chairman, to roundly criticise.\n\n\n\nBut Maude, in an interview with the Guardian, rejects any suggestion that the\n\nmodernisers have been routed. Crosby had been hired \"very late in the day\" in\n\n2005, and so had to fight a particular campaign, Maude says, adding, \"he is a\n\nbrilliant campaigner. He brings discipline, focus and clarity.\"\n\n\n\nHe also insists the basic tenets of modernisation are alive. \"Any party that\n\nceases to modernise is a party that is going backwards. The Conservative party\n\nhas been around for longer than any other party, and it has been more successful\n\nover the centuries than any other party and it's done that because it has made\n\nitself relevant to Britain as it is. We fail when we become backward looking,\n\nand don't seem to be in tune with particularly how younger people see their\n\nlives and see the country they want to live in. So if we cease to be a party in\n\ntune with contemporary Britain, that's a problem. That's why modernisation is\n\nnot something about realigning the Conservative party's principles, it is simply\n\nabout making it current and making it contemporary.\"\n\n\n\nHe adds: \"It has never been about ideology\", or shifting to the left. He points\n\nout that ever since his days as junior Thatcherite minister he has been a fiscal\n\nConservative, a realistic eurosceptic and in favour of open markets. \"The\n\ndirection in which I guess I have moved is that I am definitely more socially\n\nliberal today, but that is the direction in which the country has moved. If the\n\nConservative party were to lag behind the movement in social attitudes then that\n\nis a problem for us, but I am happy to say I don't think we have.\"\n\n\n\nSo, in that context, is a marriage tax allowance a step back? Maude denies the\n\nplan is illiberal, or that, through the tax system, the party judges one form of\n\nrelationship as superior to another.\n\n\n\nHe points out that when Cameron first made the pledge to reward marriage at the\n\n2006 Tory conference, he won applause for saying \"it would apply to a marriage\n\nbetween a man and a woman, a man and a man, and a woman and a woman . . .\n\nmarriage is one of the institutions that creates glue in society and it makes\n\nsense to recognise that\".\n\n\n\nThe value of the marriage tax allowance, he argued, was not about signifying\n\nrelationships outside marriage were inferior, but simply in its practical impact\n\non social bonds.\n\n\n\nYet it has been just these cultural issues that have recently caused the party\n\nso much grief, notably legalising gay marriage. Maude was one of the clearest\n\nTory advocates of the reform. Opponents claim the change has probably the single\n\nbiggest reason for an exodus of Tory members to Ukip.\n\n\n\nYet Maude is unrepentant, describing Ukip as out of touch with modern Britain.\n\nThe best response to the Ukip threat, he argues, lies in talking about what the\n\nConservatives will do on immigration and an EU referendum.\n\n\n\n\"We need to spend our time telling people what we're about rather than what Ukip\n\nare about. For those people who are understandably concerned about Europe, we\n\nneed to stress there is only one way to be sure of a referendum on Europe and\n\nthat is to have a Conservative-led government. If they are concerned about\n\nimmigration, immigration soared out of control under Labour and has been cut by\n\na third under the coalition.\"\n\n\n\nHe insists that when it comes to the general election, voters will focus on the\n\nfact that if they vote Ukip, they will get Ed Miliband. He is equally dismissive\n\nabout the Liberal Democrats, saying their main selling point is their ability to\n\nsay \"no\".\n\n\n\nBut is he concerned that somehow the Labour leader, with his populist attack on\n\nthe energy companies, has skillfully grabbed the cost-of-living agenda. Gove, on\n\nBBC Question Time on Thursday night, praised Miliband for raising the issue, and\n\n- in a line apparently dictated by Downing Street - took a critical view of the\n\nbig six energy companies.\n\n\n\nBut Maude is scathing about Miliband's speech declaring his energy bill price\n\nfreeze plan. He says: \"It could have been a speech written by Len McClusky (the\n\nUnite general secretary) and I think the issue for Labour is whether Ed Miliband\n\nis a strong enough leader to stand up to the unions? He's talked tough but\n\nactually when it came to it, he didn't stick with it and this was a Len McClusky\n\nspeech\".\n\n\n\nThe 20-month price freeze was \"a policy not properly thought through . . . the\n\nbiggest rise in energy prices was on Ed Miliband's watch\".\n\n\n\nThat does not mean he thinks the energy firms are above reproach, but says the\n\nanswer lies in greater competition.\n\n\n\nThe long-term key to Tory success, he argues, remains the same as in 2005 when\n\nhe presented his party with slides showing voters liked Tory policies when\n\ntested blind, but once they were ascribed to the Tories, support fell away. \"We\n\nneed to ensure that voters wish to ascribe authentic and good motives to the\n\nConservatives.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross Europe, political leaders watch Angela Merkel with awe and envy. And\n\nrightly so. The German chancellor didn't just get re-elected on Sunday, a\n\ndifficult enough task for leaders in post-crash Europe. Merkel won her hat-trick\n\nof victories in the most serene electoral performance of her career, pushing her\n\ncentre-right CDU party's vote up by nearly eight points, and coming within a\n\nwhisker of winning Germany's first overall majority since the days of Konrad\n\nAdenauer, more than half a century ago.\n\n\n\nThe only cloud in Merkel's sky was the historic collapse of her junior coalition\n\npartners, the liberal FDP, who failed to win any seats in the Bundestag for the\n\nfirst time in 60 years. That leaves Merkel with the problem of trying to\n\npersuade either the Social Democrats, or conceivably the Greens, to come into a\n\ncoalition which they may see as a fatal embrace. The nations of the eurozone's\n\nsouthern periphery will be hoping that some such deal is struck, as we all\n\nshould, since a coalition with either of them holds out the hope of a relaxation\n\nof Merkel's strict pre-election budgetary orthodoxy.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian dubbed Merkel the Special One yesterday. And as an election winner\n\nthat's exactly what she is. Consider these freshly minted popularity ratings. In\n\nBritain, David Cameron has a favourable/unfavourable rating of 40%/52% - giving\n\nhim net unpopularity of minus 12. In Germany, by contrast, 70% think Merkel is\n\ndoing a good job, against 30% who think she is doing a bad one - a net\n\npopularity of plus 40.\n\n\n\nWhat is Merkel's secret? The start of the answer is obviously that she is the\n\nleader of Europe's richest and most dynamic economy. Germany's economy is\n\ngrowing again, unemployment is low, the budget is in balance, interest rates are\n\non the floor. Times are pretty good, and getting better for many Germans.\n\nCompared with the economic carnage elsewhere in the eurozone, Germany remains an\n\noasis of relative calm and prosperity. Crisis, what crisis?\n\n\n\nBut Merkel's success cannot simply be explained by her good fortune in being the\n\nleader of Germany. Even when faced with large German bailouts of the eurozone\n\nand by sluggish growth, the centre-left failed to make its case, just as the\n\ncentre-right triumphed. The centre-left SPD remains stuck in its now much\n\ndiminished core constituency - echoes of Labour here in Britain. So do the\n\nGreens and the Left party, both of whom slipped back.\n\n\n\nYet Merkel has also won because of her own deft skills. Her republican centrism\n\nmeans that voters from other parties like her. Her willingness to adapt to\n\ncircumstances, most notably in her U-turn over nuclear power after the Fukushima\n\ndisaster, is the antithesis of conviction politics. Add to this her inclusive\n\nimage and her attractively unpretentious style, and you have a winning\n\ncombination for difficult times. Merkel's success in appealing across Germany's\n\nfragmenting party divides is a lesson from which traditional tribal politicians\n\nin Britain could learn too.\n\n\n\nWhat will it mean for Europe? Merkel sometimes gives the impression that she\n\ntakes each decision as it comes. But Berlin knows that the eurozone and the EU\n\nneed serious attention before Germany's next election in 2017. So this victory\n\ngives her an immense opportunity to write the script for Europe's future.\n\n\n\nIn an era of weak governments and unpopular leaders in Europe, she is uniquely\n\npositioned now to shape the next decade and more. In that context, the\n\nperformance by the eurosceptic Alternative fur Deutschland, who finished just\n\nshort of the 5% Bundestag threshold, was another perfect result for Merkel. She\n\ndoes not have to take account of them in order to govern, but she knows they are\n\nout there, and will be wary. It would be in character for her to temper her\n\nEuropean strategy accordingly.\n\n\n\nFrom Britain's point of view, her re-election could be fascinatingly\n\nsignificant. With Merkel at the helm in Europe, moderate Tory eurosceptics like\n\nDavid Cameron have someone with whom they can deal and who also carries real\n\nauthority here. For Cameron, an EU deal with Merkel would make an EU referendum\n\nvictory, assuming he wants it, far more likely. If Merkel wants to - and if she\n\nmeans it when she says she wants the UK to remain in the EU she should want to -\n\nshe is now in a position to influence the British debate on Europe in a more\n\npositive way than any continental European since Jacques Delors. On the great\n\nissue of Europe, the re-elected and strengthened Merkel may even help save the\n\nBritish from themselves. Let's hope she does.\n\n\n\nTwitter: @martinkettle\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nLabour plans to require firms hiring skilled foreign labour to also provide\n\nlocal apprenticeships were challenged last night when business rejected the\n\nidea, and the party conceded that the apprenticeships would have to be offered\n\nto all EU workers.\n\n\n\nIn one of its big policy announcements of the conference, Labour said large\n\nfirms would have to train an apprentice if they wished to hire a skilled worker\n\nfrom outside the EU. But the British Chambers of Commerce and CBI condemned the\n\nproposals as adding more red tape. Some Labour frontbench members were shocked\n\nthat greater effort had not been made to convince business leaders in advance.\n\n\n\nSome Labour figures involved in framing the apprenticeship policy did not appear\n\nto have been consulted.\n\n\n\nThe advance publicity suggested \"a Brit job for each foreign worker hired\".\n\nMiliband was himself quoted as saying: \"Any firm that wants to bring in a\n\nforeign worker from outside the EU will also have to train up someone who is a\n\nlocal worker.\" But Labour internal briefings had made clear that the\n\napprenticeships would have to be available to anyone in the EU.\n\n\n\nThe policy has been in preparation for months and the party said it would be\n\nincluded in a Labour government's immigration bill in the first term of\n\nparliament.\n\n\n\nHowever Alan Milburn, a former cabinet minister, said he was \"worried\" about\n\nLabour's stance on immigration. He said he fears the party is \"conniving\" with\n\nthe Tories and Liberal Democrats to limit the number of foreigners coming into\n\nthe country. Britain needs more, not less, immigration to deal with the demands\n\nof an ageing society, he said.\n\n\n\nThe Tory business minister Matthew Hancock said the scheme was unravelling and\n\nillegal. To meet European rules on free movement of labour, the Tories said,\n\nMiliband's policy would have to require companies to take on an EU national\n\napprentice, rather than a UK national, for every non-EU worker hired.\n\n\n\nBut Labour's immigration spokesman, Chris Bryant, said Hancock was wrong to\n\nsuggest the apprenticeship policy would be unlawful. The posts would be\n\navailable to anyone from the European Economic Area (EEA) - the EU, Iceland,\n\nLiechtenstein and Norway - but in practice were likely to go to UK applicants.\n\nLabour said the number of Germans or Bulgarians who would take up the offer of a\n\nUK apprenticeship was minimal.\n\n\n\nJohn Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, condemned\n\nthe scheme as an \"apprentice tax\" on employers and on job creation. \"It serves\n\nneither to control immigration, where we should have a points system linked more\n\nstrongly to economic benefit, nor young people, who should be encouraged and\n\nproperly supported rather than being used to control immigration by other means.\n\n\n\n\"Businesses need to be able to choose the talents and resource they need, and\n\nsometimes cannot find in the UK. This immigration benefits Britain. Penalising\n\ngood companies by making the grant of a work permit conditional on taking on a\n\nUK apprentice just raises business costs and new red tape. There are far better\n\nways to support employers to take on and train our young people.\"\n\n\n\nMiliband has highlighted a series of policies designed to provide greater\n\nsecurity for workers, including action on zero-hours contracts, and an increase\n\nin the maximum fine from Â£5,000 to Â£50,000 for paying below the minimum wage, as\n\nwell as new powers for councils to enforce the minimum wage. No company was\n\nprosecuted for underpaying between 1998 and 2007, and the shadow home secretary\n\nsaid there had to be more prosecutions.\n\n\n\nLabour has also set up a review to look into how the minimum wage can regain its\n\nlost value, but put no figure on the necessary rise, or any timetable. Similar\n\nproposals were announced by Vince Cable, the business secretary, last week.\n\n\n\nIn his interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme Miliband ruled out an early\n\ncommitment to hold a referendum on British membership of the EU, but left open\n\nthe possibility of changing his stance before the election. \"We set out a very,\n\nvery clear position on this but we will set out our position at the election,\"\n\nhe said.\n\n\n\nLast night, the shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, acknowledged there\n\nwere splits in the shadow cabinet over a referendum, but that it was more an\n\nissue of \"refreshing consent rather than securing exit\". He told a fringe\n\nmeeting: \"I am not for a moment pretending there are not some who have suggested\n\nwe should countenance a referendum. But I would argue that those people within\n\nLabour who argue for a referendum overwhelmingly see it as a means of refreshing\n\nconsent rather than securing exit.\"\n\n\n\nMiliband told Marr that Labour would not build any more free schools and prevent\n\nexisting ones from expanding. But he said he would not close \"good schools\".\n\n\n\nMiliband will also announce fresh plans to clamp down on profiteering energy\n\ncompanies and a major housebuilding programme.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nBackstage deal\n\n\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband chats with the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, and shadow\n\nchief secretary to the Treasury, Rachel Reeves, during the first day of Labour's\n\nconference Photograph: Stefan Rousseau\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela Merkel may be the only German politician with true global recognition,\n\nbut Sunday's vote appears set to project into the limelight a less familiar\n\npolitical duo, whose views and temperaments would shake up Europe and wrongfoot\n\nDavid Cameron.\n\n\n\nOnce the votes from the election are counted on Sunday night, Merkel may well\n\nfind herself relying on the centre-left SPD for a governing majority. And the\n\nunwritten rules of German coalitions mean that junior coalition partner bigwigs\n\nget heavyweight roles - either foreign minister or finance minister.\n\n\n\nStep forward Sigmar Gabriel and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, two SPD stalwarts with\n\npro-European credentials who could jeopardise Cameron's strategy of\n\nrenegotiating Britain's relationship with the EU ahead of a referendum. One\n\nparty insider insists that the Social Democrats would \"actively try to block\n\nattempts to return EU powers to national governments\", as Cameron has proposed.\n\nA source at the foreign ministry said: \"Any attempt to cherry-pick EU policies\n\nto keep or discard would cause friction with the traditional SPD line.\"\n\n\n\nWhile Merkel has surprised many with her tolerance towards Cameron's \"review of\n\ncompetences\" between EU and UK, a German government with Social Democrat\n\ninvolvement is likely to take a dim view of \"Europe a la carte\", especially in\n\nregard to social regulations such as the working time directive.\n\n\n\nSteinmeier in particular is said to be a committed European with close links to\n\nthe French Socialists. The Social Democrats' failed candidate in the 2009\n\nelection, and foreign minister during the last grand coalition, he will remember\n\nGerman frustration with British intransigence on Europe during the government of\n\nGerhard Schroder, for whom he was chief of staff.\n\n\n\nPressed on the subject, one of his advisers insists that he \"has great interest\n\nin keeping Britain in the EU\", but it is worth remembering comments he made as\n\nrecently as December 2011: \"I fear the decisive step for Great Britain's exit\n\nhas already been made . . . a process of alienation will become inevitable and\n\nirreversible.\"\n\n\n\nTemperamentally, Steinmeier could hardly be further apart from Gabriel, his main\n\nopponent in a post-election race for the ministerial rank. Steinmeier has a\n\nreputation as a bureaucrat who rarely loses his temper but also struggles to\n\nraise the spirit of the party faithful. During his first stint as foreign\n\nminister, he clashed with Merkel over the arrangements for Barack Obama's first\n\nBerlin visit, but broadly he is seen as sharing her \"consensual\" approach.\n\n\n\nGabriel, on the other had, is what Germans call a Bauchmensch, someone who acts\n\non gut instinct. Aged 56 and a former teacher who was once nicknamed \"Siggi Pop\"\n\nin his party, he is a impassioned orator and seasoned campaigner, who worked his\n\nway through the SPD's party ranks and was responsible for the leftward lurch in\n\nhis party's current manifesto. He has openly called for the party to distance\n\nitself from its \"neoliberal phase\" under Schroder. \"Instead of changing the\n\npolitical centre, the centre changed us,\" he said at the recent party\n\nconference.\n\n\n\nIt is no surprise that the two men are said to share a mutual loathing of one\n\nanother. \"I haven't joined his fan club yet,\" Steinmeier said after Gabriel\n\nsuggested the reintroduction of a wealth tax in 2009, and they are said to have\n\nclashed after Gabriel tried to convince colleagues to vote against Merkel's\n\nfiscal pact.\n\n\n\nYet it is Gabriel who currently has edged ahead of his rival in most\n\ncommentators' assessments. Christoph Schwennicke, editor of political monthly\n\nCicero and an SPD expert, believes Gabriel can lay claim to the vice chancellory\n\nunless his party gets below 24%. Since the two parties would take turns in\n\npicking their ministerial posts, Steinmeier would only be left with a minor role\n\nand may decide to stay out of politics altogether.\n\n\n\nEither way, observers in No 10 are advised to keep their eye on the SPD. The\n\nlast time the Social Democrats entered a grand coalition, they emerged with\n\ntheir worst electoral result since the foundation of the federal republic,\n\nmainly because the party was seen as getting on with Merkel all too well. In\n\norder to avoid a rerun, many want a less cosy kind of coalition arrangement, and\n\nwill welcome the first good scrap with Merkel's CDU. A showdown with Britain may\n\njust be what they are looking for.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nSigmar Gabriel, 56, has steered the SPD to the left and is tipped to be vice\n\nchancellor if his party secures 24% of the vote\n\n\n\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier, a former foreign minister, has stated his ambition to\n\nkeep Britain inside the EU\n\n\n\nBy the time votes are counted in Germany's federal elections on Sunday night\n\nAngela Merkel could find herself relying on the centre-left SDP to deliver her a\n\nthird term in office Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce, with his customary elevation of tone, Ed Balls called the idea of Labour\n\nruling out an in/out referendum on the EU \"stupid\". So let me be stupid just for\n\na moment: Ed Miliband should rule out a referendum now.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year Miliband and his colleagues were absolutely right to criticise\n\nthe prime minister for his irresponsibility in calling a referendum five years\n\nhence in circumstances unknown and after an at best uncertain negotiation for a\n\nnew settlement with the EU. They pointed out the potentially disastrous\n\nconsequences for market confidence and inward investment decisions. It would\n\nalso be a distraction for the whole EU at a time when it should be concentrating\n\non getting Europe back to work.\n\n\n\nThe British people seem not to have fallen for David Cameron's cynical manoeuvre\n\nto shore up his position. If opportunism by a truly Eurosceptic party is not\n\nrewarded by electors, imagine the punishment that would be meted out to a\n\ngenuinely pro-European party that lost its nerve on the EU after, perhaps, a\n\nsurge in the polls for Ukip at the next European elections; or in the feverish\n\npre-election atmosphere; or, say, at a party conference in some cack-handed\n\nattempt to regain the initiative. A dose of opportunism may sometimes be\n\nnecessary in politics; but make it too blatant and it quite simply backfires.\n\n\n\nSuppose we commit to holding an in/out referendum after the next election. Will\n\nthe next Labour government have such a rosy inheritance as to afford a luxury\n\nthat would not just be a distraction, but would derail our attempts to build\n\nbusiness confidence and attract investment and jobs to the UK?\n\n\n\nThe Labour approach - working with socialist and progressive allies in other\n\nmember states, attacking the austerity orthodoxy and committing the EU to a\n\ngrowth agenda and strong social policies - would be undermined if we were\n\nplanning at the same time, for our own short-termist mediocre reasons, a\n\nreferendum that could foreshadow our exit.\n\n\n\nSo the only possible argument left for those in Labour who say we should opt for\n\nan in/out referendum is the supposed democratic one. \"The people\" want their say\n\nand that trumps all considerations. But the people's clamour is muffled: Europe\n\nremains low down the list of public concerns.\n\n\n\nSupporting the idea that our destiny is bound up with being a central player in\n\nEurope is never going to be a great vote-winner. But Labour would gain respect\n\nfor being clear; for the contrast with the irresponsibility of the Tories; for\n\nhighlighting the anti-welfare-state agenda of which this is part; and perhaps\n\nfor showing a bit of statesmanship in the national interest. We would also find\n\nsupport among business people. And after all, ultranationalists and Europhobes\n\nwill not be voting Labour.\n\n\n\nOur chance of winning the election will be determined by the seriousness of our\n\neconomic programme, on which the shadow chancellor is doubtless devoting his not\n\ninconsiderable talents. A referendum commitment would undermine its credibility.\n\nPutting a clear and irrevocable stop now to months of media speculation on\n\nwhether Labour will triangulate our European future would help to focus our\n\nattack on the miserable coalition record and our alternative.\n\n\n\nAnd speaking of democracy, were Miliband and the shadow cabinet to go for a\n\nreferendum, notwithstanding their own previous crystal-clear condemnation of the\n\nTories' proposal, they would be reversing a central feature of party policy. It\n\nis to be hoped that this could only be contemplated after thorough debate within\n\nthe party at all levels, followed by a democratic decision of party members -\n\nnot a diktat from on high.\n\n\n\nJulian Priestley, a former Labour parliamentary candidate and secretary general\n\nof the European parliament, is the author of Our Europe, Not Theirs\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIn devotedly pro-European Germany, it is a radical message. In a packed beer\n\nhall meeting on the outskirts of Stuttgart, Roland Klaus tells scores of\n\nmiddle-aged, middle-class Germans what they want to hear. In short - no more\n\nbailouts.\n\n\n\n\"We've got the possibility to stop this madness,\" the former financial TV\n\njournalist intones. \"Germany pays for no more rescue packages.\"\n\n\n\nIn an election in which the major parties essentially support Chancellor Angela\n\nMerkel's approach to the euro crisis, and two-thirds of Germans back her euro\n\nrescue plans, it is a surprise to find that thousands of Germans want to leave\n\nthe single currency.\n\n\n\nThe conventional argument is that Germany has come out of the euro crisis better\n\nthan its partners, and that Merkel has protected German national interests by\n\nfoisting austerity on the European south.\n\n\n\nBut not everyone sees it that way. And a new party, the Alternative fur\n\nDeutschland (AfD), is seeking to tap into that resentment to get seats in\n\nparliament in next Sunday's election.\n\n\n\nThe alternative to further bailouts, says the party, would be to refuse aid to\n\nfaltering economies, encouraging them to leave the eurozone under their own\n\nsteam. This would pave the way for a two-speed Europe with parallel currencies -\n\none for the struggling south and one for the productive north.\n\n\n\nThe plan appeals to voters like those in Baden-Wurttemberg, home to the\n\ncountry's automobile industry and global headquarters of luxury carmakers\n\nDaimler and Porsche. Many here say the euro was always doomed because of the\n\ncultural gulf between the \"lazy\" south and the \"industrious\" north.\n\n\n\nAnd if a smaller, streamlined eurozone failed to materialise, the party has\n\ndared to suggest Germany would be better off out of it. \"We'd say it clear. It\n\ncan't be a taboo any more that it's an option for Germany to return to the\n\nDeutschmark,\" the AfD's Klaus tells his supporters to rapturous applause.\n\n\n\nThe AfD was formed in April by an economics professor, Bernd Lucke, who has\n\ndescribed the euro as a \"great mistake and failure\". It has remained a fringe\n\nparty - openly anti-euro sentiments have remained off-limits for all mainstream\n\nparties. And despite everything, 66% of Germans support Merkel's policy of\n\nrescuing the euro.\n\n\n\nBut this idealistic commitment to Europe, says the AfD, is blinding the country\n\nto the long-term costs of repeatedly bailing out the eurozone. \"We aren't left\n\nor right,\" Klaus says. \"We're citizens who are worried about the future of our\n\ncountry.\"\n\n\n\nFor all Germany's pro-European rhetoric, there are signs these fears are not\n\nuncommon. A poll in April suggested just under a third of Germans would in\n\nprinciple vote for an anti-euro party - yet it is still unclear whether this\n\nwill translate into the minimum 5% of votes needed for the eurosceptics to enter\n\nparliament in next weekend's election.\n\n\n\n\"The issue of Europe, let alone the common European currency, has never played a\n\nrole in a German election,\" says Peter Matuschek, political analyst at German\n\npublic opinion researchers Forsa. \"As a purely anti-euro party, the AfD would\n\nhave no chance of getting enough votes to enter parliament.\"\n\n\n\nWary of being pigeonholed as a single-issue party, the AfD has promoted its\n\nwider, populist policies. Calls for a tougher stance on unskilled immigrants and\n\nstricter rules on benefits to stem economic migrants appeal to the rightwing\n\npopulist vote, as does the promotion of Swiss-style direct democracy based on\n\nreferendums.\n\n\n\nIn response, leftwing groups have accused the AfD of providing a political home\n\nfor neo-Nazis and racists, something vehemently denied by the leadership. Yet\n\nover the summer regional chapters said they had seen attempts by Germany's\n\nfar-right fringe to infiltrate the party. Desperate to shake off this damaging\n\nassociation, the AfD has distanced itself from other anti-EU parties across\n\nEurope, emphasising it is not calling for Germany to exit the EU.\n\n\n\nThe party's fortunes were given a boost last month when the German finance\n\nminister, Wolfgang Schauble, indicated that Greece would probably need yet\n\nanother bailout. Since then party officials say their support has swelled and\n\nthey are now expecting to hit at least 7% or 8% of the vote, despite struggling\n\nto top 3% in the polls.\n\n\n\nAnalysts say the AfD's chances on 22 September will be at the mercy of\n\nunpredictable protest voters. \"At every election . . . there are protest voters\n\nwho, without ideological conviction, vote for any party they feel will most\n\nclearly demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the status quo,\" says Klaus-Peter\n\nSchoppner, head of opinion pollster Emnid.\n\n\n\nIf the AfD gets enough votes to enter the Bundestag it could deny a majority to\n\neither the current coalition government or the opposition - potentially forcing\n\nMerkel into a pact with rivals the Social Democratic party (SPD). Neither party\n\nwants this, but polls suggest this would be a majority of voters' preferred\n\noutcome.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nRoland Klaus has called for an end to eurozone bailouts\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there is one thing that is clear from a lacklustre German election campaign,\n\nit is that the voters are not hungry for change. That's excellent news for the\n\nincumbent chancellor, Angela Merkel, who looks like a shoo-in for a third term\n\non 22 September. The big question is, who becomes her junior coalition partner:\n\nthe current liberals, or Free Democrats (FDP), if they surmount the\n\n5%-of-the-vote hurdle, or a grand coalition with the second-biggest party, the\n\nSocial Democrats (SPD)?\n\n\n\nIf the Germans are voting for no big change in Germany, they will also be voting\n\nfor no dramatic shift in Merkel's European policy. Unlikely to disappoint her\n\nvoters, she is certain to disappoint her fellow EU leaders.\n\n\n\n\"However the Germans vote, Berlin's attitude to the EU is not going to change\n\nmuch,\" Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, wrote this\n\nweek. Most analysts agree.\n\n\n\nUlrike Guerot, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, in Berlin, said:\n\n\"The Germany that many in Europe hope for is not on offer. It is hard to imagine\n\nany new government coalition - or the old one, if it is returned to power -\n\nproviding enlightened leadership of a kind that accepts significant short-term\n\nsacrifice to buy into a far more uncertain vision of long-term political\n\nstability. Germany lives in a different world.\"\n\n\n\nEU business has been effectively on hold for months as the union awaits the\n\noutcome of what is by far the biggest political event in Europe this year. The\n\nballot will be followed by weeks of horse trading and programme-writing as\n\nMerkel weighs up her coalition options.\n\n\n\nThe pressures on Merkel are high. David Cameron is keen to forge a reformist\n\nalliance that would allow him to \"repatriate\" powers to Britain from Brussels\n\nbefore a 2017 referendum on EU membership.\n\n\n\nThose hopes are almost certain to be dashed. Any new deal would entail\n\nrenegotiating the EU treaties. There is no appetite for that in Brussels or\n\nParis, and a diminishing one in Berlin. The odds are that Cameron will be\n\ndisappointed. He won't be the only one.\n\n\n\nThe big innovation currently being cooked up in eurozone capitals in response to\n\nthe euro crisis is the new system of banking supervision and regulation known as\n\nthe banking union. The idea is to make the European Central Bank in Frankfurt\n\nthe supervisory authority for the eurozone banking sector, initially the big\n\nbanks. That bit is effectively accomplished and comes into force towards the end\n\nof next year.\n\n\n\nIts corollary is the tricky part: a resolution authority and fund to deal with\n\nweak or bad banks. That body would decide whether a bank gets wound up or helped\n\nout. For the European commission, the French, the Italians and the Spanish, that\n\nmeans common fiscal backstops in the eurozone and pooled eurozone funds for\n\ndealing with a banking collapse.\n\n\n\nThe Germans are resisting, unwilling to have to pay for other countries' bank\n\nfailures or repairs and also reluctant to force German banks to contribute to a\n\nresolution fund that could shore up, for example, a Spanish bank.\n\n\n\nEnrico Letta, the Italian prime minister, pleaded in Brussels on Monday for\n\ngreater German flexibility. \"Some degree of risk-sharing\" was needed in the\n\neurozone, he argued.\n\n\n\nConsistently, through more than three years of eurozone crisis, Merkel has been\n\npressed to do more, but her bottom line has always been to refuse German\n\nliability for the faults of others unless German rules are observed.\n\n\n\nFrance is impatient for the German election to be over. On certain issues the\n\ntwo sides may be nearing common ground: they have both turned against Brussels\n\nand the European commission, and increasingly see the eurozone, as opposed to\n\nthe wider EU, as the fulcrum of European integration. It is here that things may\n\nchange after the election, but more likely by stealth and small steps.\n\n\n\nWith EU leaders confident they have weathered the worst of the crisis, Merkel\n\ncan claim vindication, and will find little reason to change her approach.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Angela Merkel is re-elected on 22 September, she will become Europe's longest\n\nserving elected female head of government. Yet there is still plenty of mystery\n\nabout this woman who charted an unlikely course from research science in the\n\nformer communist East Germany to leader of Europe's most powerful nation.\n\n\n\n1. Angela Kazmierczak?\n\n\n\nNot only was her grandfather of Polish origin, the chancellor was almost born\n\nAngela Kazmierczak. Her grandfather was Ludwig Kazmierczak, born 1896 in Poznan\n\n- then part of the German reich. He emigrated to Berlin when Poznan became\n\nPolish after the first world war, married a Berlin woman, and they had a son,\n\nHorst, Angela's father. In the early 1930s the family Germanised their surname\n\nto Kasner. Father and son converted from Catholicism to Protestantism -\n\nsomething Merkel didn't know until recently - a puzzling discovery for a woman\n\nwho grew up in a rectory and whose faith is key to her personality.\n\n\n\n2. Plum job\n\n\n\nIn her early public life, Merkel loved to brag about her cooking abilities,\n\nespecially her plum cake. The cake soon became a measure of how much time she\n\ncould afford her private life and husband. As a junior minister under Helmut\n\nKohl, she was still able to have two or three baking weekends each plum season.\n\nThe plum cake stories trickled away when she became chancellor.\n\n\n\n3. Dog days\n\n\n\nMerkel and Vladimir Putin go back further than you might think. He was a KGB\n\nagent in East Germany when the wall fell. Merkel, the greatest benefactor of the\n\n1989-revolution, got a taste of his intimidatory tactics very early. When she\n\nfirst visited the Kremlin as chancellor, Putin gave her a plush toy dog as a\n\ngift. Merkel has been deeply afraid of dogs since she was bitten in the\n\nmid-1990s. The next meeting Putin let in his black Labrador Kony. Merkel sat\n\nfrozen, and pictures show Putin with a grin.\n\n\n\n4. Inca hoots\n\n\n\nMerkel sees similarities between the EU and the ancient Inca. Merkel fears the\n\nEuropean value system could also suddenly disappear without trace. Democracy,\n\nliberal market economies, the western legal system are battling the modern\n\nversion of the cold war against authoritarian, non-democratic but economically\n\nstrong systems. Merkel has seen a state collapse in her lifetime. That's the\n\nreason for her call to competitiveness and recovery in Europe - and she's afraid\n\nEurope doesn't get it.\n\n\n\n5. Easy Cameron, easy go\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron sees himself as a close ally of Merkel. But the feeling might not\n\nbe reciprocated. She likes his policies, his global vision, his stands on\n\ncompetitiveness and the Asian challenge and his debating skills. She is also\n\nkeen on changing the treaties, but only if there is a strong need. Losing the\n\nentire EU system in one of the many referenda following a change would be too\n\ndangerous. So Merkel is a fan of the newly discovered intergovernmentalism -\n\ntreaties between member states instead of ever more integration favouring the\n\ncommission. Cameron got a taste when he was asked to join the fiscal pact during\n\nthe euro crisis. He decided against. Britain is out. And Merkel couldn't care\n\nless.\n\n\n\n6. Euro plan\n\n\n\nSo, how does Merkel really want to get out of the euro mess? She has a plan,\n\nwritten down in summer 2011 by an adviser. In it she accepts that key policies\n\nwithin EU member states have to be controlled more closely and jointly to keep\n\nthe currency alive. Will that mean more Brussels? The opposite is true. Merkel\n\nis aware of the public being tired of the commission and the lack of\n\naccountability. So for the time being, she'd prefer national governments writing\n\nthe rules and sticking to them.\n\n\n\nStefan Kornelius is the foreign editor of Suddeutsche Zeitung and author of\n\nAngela Merkel: the Authorised Biography, from Alma Books\n\n\n\n",

The list\n\nof interested parties therefore includes Britain.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron has three particular reasons for wanting Chancellor Angela\n\nMerkel's centre-right CDU to be re-elected next month. The first is that, in\n\nspite of real differences over what it means to be a centre-right party in\n\n21st-century Europe, the CDU and the Conservatives remain sister parties. They\n\nhave become distanced, notably because of Tory Euroscepticism - not shared by\n\nthe CDU - and by Mr Cameron's withdrawal of the Tories from the European\n\nPeople's party grouping. But the Tories clearly have even less in common with\n\nthe CDU's principal rivals, the Social Democratic party of Germany (SPD).\n\n\n\nMr Cameron's second reason is that it would be good news for incumbents like\n\nhim. For a while, after the 2008 financial crisis, European voters simply took\n\nit out on incumbent governments - whatever their political stripe. Brown and\n\nZapatero on the left, Berlusconi and Sarkozy on the right - all lost out. If Mrs\n\nMerkel manages to buck the trend, not least in the wake of her commitment to\n\neconomic austerity and deficit reduction, the Tories will see light at the end\n\nof their own tunnel too.\n\n\n\nBut Mr Cameron's principal reason for wanting a CDU victory next month is that a\n\nre-elected Mrs Merkel would be pivotal to his own EU strategy if he, too,\n\nsecures re-election in 2015. Last week, in an important interview, Mrs Merkel\n\nsignalled that, if re-elected, she is willing to look at EU moves to \"give\n\nsomething back\" to member states. This is what Mr Cameron says he wants to do\n\ntoo, so that he can offer British voters a renegotiated relationship with the EU\n\nto approve in his 2017 referendum. If reports are to be believed, two areas on\n\nwhich the UK and Germany might agree are migrant benefits and labour market\n\nregulation.\n\n\n\nThe upshot of all this is deeply paradoxical. Tories like Mr Cameron, who want\n\nto stay in the EU after renegotiations of the sort which the German leader seems\n\nnow to be sanctioning, will obviously want Mrs Merkel to be re-elected. But\n\nthere are few things the Tories' out-and-out anti-Europeans should fear more\n\nthan a German chancellor willing to make concessions to keep the UK in the EU.\n\nFor anti-EU Tories, nothing would be worse than Mrs Merkel's re-election and the\n\nboost it might give to an eventual yes vote in a UK referendum.\n\n\n\n",

According to a Palestinian source, Kerry had\n\nwritten a letter giving a US assurance that the basis of territorial talks would\n\nbe the pre-1967 border, but it was not clear whether the letter had been\n\ndelivered.\n\n\n\n\"If we have well-defined terms of reference and a clear time frame - by which we\n\nmean the end of the year - we will go into talks,\" the source said.\n\n\n\nAmong the few formal statements of the day, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin\n\nNetanyahu, told cabinet colleagues that resuming the diplomatic process was \"a\n\nvital strategic interest of the State of Israel, first of all because we want\n\npeace\". However, any agreement would be put to a referendum, he added.\n\n\n\nThe Israeli president, Shimon Peres, congratulated his Palestinian counterpart\n\non \"a brave and historic decision to return to negotiations\". He added: \"Don't\n\nlisten to the sceptics, you did the right thing.\"\n\n\n\nAmong the sceptics were Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza, which described any\n\nengagement in talks by the Palestinian leadership as a \"betrayal\".\n\n\n\nThere was no firm indication of when talks in Washington might begin. Kerry said\n\non Friday that if everything went \"as expected\" the first meeting would take\n\nplace \"within a week or so\".\n\n\n\nThe main sticking point continues to be the Palestinian demand that the pre-1967\n\nborders form the baseline for territorial negotiations, a guarantee which Israel\n\nrefuses to give. If Kerry fails to persuade the Palestinians they have firm US\n\nbacking on the issue, talks may fail to get off the ground. There is also\n\ndisagreement over the timeframe. Israel is pushing for negotiations to last up\n\nto a year, fuelling concern among critics who believe Netanyahu is seeking to\n\ngive the appearance of diplomatic co-operation while stalling for as long as\n\npossible on any outcome.\n\n\n\nAny likely agreed time frame will take the Palestinians well beyond the\n\npotential flashpoint of the UN general assembly in September, at which they\n\ncould renew their efforts to become a member state of the global body, a move\n\nfiercely opposed by Israel and the United States.\n\n\n\nBoth sides agreed to refrain from commenting on the negotiations. \"Even people\n\nclosest to the (Palestinian) leadership know very little,\" said Ghassan Khatib,\n\nformer director of communications for the Palestinian Authority. \"The thing that\n\nbothers me is that it seems that the resumption of negotiations is seen as an\n\nobjective in itself. But the problem was never the lack of negotiations, direct\n\nor indirect. It is the huge gap between Israel's stated position and its\n\npractices, and the lack of willingness by the US to put pressure on them.\"\n\n\n\nA Palestinian source said that the publication of EU guidelines on Friday\n\nbanning funding or grants to Israeli bodies with links to settlements was\n\n\"decisive\" in persuading the Palestinians to take the first steps back to\n\nnegotiations.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Tzipi Livni, Israel's justice minister and representative in the\n\nKerry-brokered talks, has urged the EU to designate the Lebanese militant group\n\nHezbollah as a terrorist organisation. Writing in the Guardian, Livni says: \"A\n\nfirm distinction between legitimate, non-violent political parties and terrorist\n\norganisations is crucial for the survival of freedom, democracy and moderation.\n\nThe clear message must be sent to extremists that violence and terrorism is\n\nunacceptable and contradictory to our values, and that legitimacy can only be\n\ngained through the repudiation of violence.\"\n\n\n\n",

Undoubtedly painful, but over quickly.\"\n\n\n\n&#10002;He was ever the plain speaker, but on other occasions, as we reported\n\nhere, BBC types do resort to euphemism. Last week we told of the campaign to\n\npersuade them to describe waterboarding plainly as \"torture\" rather than the\n\ncurrent \"harsh interrogation technique\". Reflecting on their apparent reluctance\n\nto do so, we invited reader suggestions on other euphemisms for acts of state\n\nbrutality. Philip Howells emails, full of ideas: stress positions re-imagined as\n\n\"muscle definition therapy\"; the rack - a \"toning extension table\"; and shock\n\ntreatment, that's \"electrical genital excitement\". You don't work for the BBC,\n\ndo you Philip?\n\n\n\n&#10002;Ministers, meanwhile, try to get to grips with immigration.

I complained to them that there was a chap at\n\nthe end of the road who was one of those who sells you the gold ring that he\n\ndrops on the ground. You pick it up and it has got '19' on it, and he says, 'Can\n\nyou give me some money?' And you say: 'Are you an illegal immigrant?'\"\n\nPresumably; taken aback, they confess. \"All these immigrant groups, once they\n\nare established, become extraordinarily British,\" he says. \"And they want to\n\neducate their children; above all, they want to see things bettered. If you are\n\nlooking at televisions, audiovisual, it is the Caribbean that has the skills.\"\n\nHe is quite the expert isn't he?\n\n\n\n&#10002;Things are looking up for our Eurosceptic man of the moment, Professor\n\nAlan Sked, as he plots the creation of his new centre-left party to give Ukip a\n\nrun for its money. With our help he's gaining traction. All that talk of almost\n\nnude dancing at student parties he organised doesn't seem to be damaging him at\n\nall. \"Graham Stringer MP and David Nuttall MP have asked me to join the advisory\n\ncouncil of the Democracy Movement\", the all-party campaign that is being\n\norganised to pursue a \"moderately expressed and well-researched campaign\" for a\n\nno vote in any referendum, he tells us. The Greek United Popular Front has also\n\nbeen in touch. It has asked Sked to address a rally in Athens alongside Michael\n\nMoore, Noam Chomsky, and Naomi Klein etc. The Front wants to get Greece out of\n\nthe euro and the EU. And if there's an after party, watch out.\n\n\n\n&#10002;Finally, in light of the weekend's sporting development, some related\n\nreading. Where to start?

The vote was triggered after Peter Luff\n\nand Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, two Tory MPs who support the bill, agreed to act as\n\ntellers for the no votes.\n\n\n\nThe number of votes in favour exactly matches the number of Conservative MPs who\n\nfaced a three-line whip to support the bill. But not every Tory voted in favour.\n\nThe numbers were boosted by a handful of Labour supporters.\n\n\n\nHague was scathing about the Labour leadership.

One day Unite (the trade union) will give them the\n\norders of how to vote.\"\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron fully supports the Wharton bill, which, in the absence of Liberal\n\nDemocrat support for a government measure, is the only way in which the Tories\n\ncan vote in favour of the prime minister's 2017 referendum pledge.\n\n\n\nThe Labour leadership is embarking on an intense debate on whether to embarrass\n\nDowning Street by tabling an amendment to call for a referendum before the 2015\n\ngeneral election.

And there are silly questions.\n\nBritain's place in the European Union is a serious question of the first order.\n\nSo, possibly with some reservations, is a referendum on continued British\n\nmembership of the EU. But James Wharton MP's European Union (referendum) bill,\n\non which the massed ranks of Conservative MPs will vote at Westminster today,\n\ndoes not raise a serious question at all. Instead, this attempt to bind the next\n\nparliament to hold a referendum in 2017 is a sideshow, even by the standards of\n\nthe farce that now passes for Conservative party debate on Europe. It is a silly\n\nstunt, nothing more and nothing less, and the closer the day of the vote has\n\ncome, the sillier it has looked.\n\n\n\nIt is less than six months since David Cameron - a Conservative leader who once\n\nsensibly warned his party against banging on about Europe - went to the City of\n\nLondon and banged on that a future Tory government would hold a referendum on UK\n\nmembership of the EU in 2017. This was meant to cement Mr Cameron's control over\n\nhis party over Europe. But in May, after Ukip electoral successes had put the\n\nwind up the Tory party (much of which believes Ukip is right about leaving the\n\nEU anyway), a succession of serving and former ministers said they want Britain\n\nout, while more than 100 Tory MPs then voted for a stronger referendum pledge.\n\nMr Cameron, who had previously opposed the idea of legislating in this\n\nparliament for a referendum in the next one, promptly published a bill to make\n\nit happen, which Mr Wharton has now picked up as a piece of private member's\n\nlegislation. Even more bizarrely, Mr Cameron has insisted that all Tory MPs must\n\nsupport it, on a three-line whip. As a constitutional position it is a nonsense,\n\nbecause no parliament can bind its successors. As an exercise in leadership it\n\nhas been shameful.\n\n\n\nPolitics, though, is a fickle business. The same Conservatives who lost their\n\nheads over Europe and plotted against Mr Cameron in May have now rather lost\n\ntheir interest in the bill which they once deemed to be so crucial to his\n\nleadership. Just conceivably, this may have something to do with the recent\n\ndrop-off in poll support and publicity for Ukip. Fear of Ukip on the Tory\n\nbenches has not disappeared but it has certainly declined. At any event, as the\n\nsecond reading of the Wharton bill loomed, the EU referendum issue has been\n\nrelegated to the margins. There is no drumbeat of expectation about the outcome\n\nof today's vote and no head of steam in the rightwing press either. None of the\n\nEurophobes on the Tory backbenches who used to make Mr Cameron's life a misery\n\nhave made any trouble for him. Instead, Mr Cameron and his backbenchers are all\n\nhaving a barbecue in the Downing Street garden. The skewers will stay in the\n\nkebabs.\n\n\n\nIt is just as well that expectations have been lowered about today's vote.\n\nLabour and Liberal Democrat MPs have adopted the simple expedient of going back\n\nto their own constituencies as usual this Friday, thus denying Mr Wharton the\n\nchance to inflate this exercise into a major political event. They are right to\n\ndo so, because today's vote is a masquerade. It is up to the voters what the\n\n2015 parliament looks like and whether it holds a referendum on the EU. It is\n\nnot up to a Tory parliamentary party which does not even have a majority in this\n\nparliament to make that choice. Mr Wharton will presumably win the vote today.\n\nBut it will be an entirely hollow achievement.\n\n\n\nThis is emphatically not serious politics or serious government. It is not even\n\nserious as an exercise in party management. The parliamentary Conservative party\n\nposed for a team photograph on the green benches at Westminster last night. But\n\ndivisions on Europe between those who want to leave and those who want to stay\n\nremain as large as ever. Europe remains a fundamental and serious question in\n\nBritish life - as the head of the CBI rightly argued again this week. But the\n\nTory party no longer has anything serious to say about it.\n\n\n\n",

The shadow cabinet is\n\ndiscussing the possibility, but Ian Austin, a shadow transport minister and a\n\nclose ally of senior shadow cabinet members, has already used a newspaper\n\narticle to back a pre-election date.\n\n\n\nIf Labour does decide to go ahead with the amendment, it will not table it until\n\nthe Commons report stage in late autumn, and the bill should pass its second\n\nreading relatively easily.\n\n\n\nA Labour amendment would pose a dilemma for Tory MPs, many of whom support an\n\nearly referendum but have been willing so far to co-operate with David Cameron's\n\nstrategy of trying to negotiate treaty changes, and stage a referendum by 2017\n\nif they are not made.\n\n\n\nInfluential figures such as Liam Fox may speak in today's debate , which would\n\nmark a rare intervention since he resigned as defence secretary. Fox, one of 12\n\nsponsors of the Wharton bill, has said he has no fears about life outside the\n\nEU. He would be one of many MPs who would have to think seriously if Labour\n\ntabled their amendment.\n\n\n\nWharton himself has said that any amendments are likely to kill the bill as it\n\nneeds to be changed as little as possible if it is to reach the statute book as\n\na private member's bill. Any move by Labour to force an earlier date for a\n\nreferendum would also cause Cameron to think about how he could kill off the\n\nbill.\n\n\n\nThe shadow cabinet is deeply divided on how to proceed. Ed Miliband has insisted\n\nthere is no need to make a decision on a referendum now, reasoning that\n\ndiscussion of such a possibility could jeopardise the country's economic\n\nrecovery and put potential investors off.

Austin insists he is\n\nsetting out his own views and not acting on anyone else's behalf.\n\n\n\nNo 10 responded to the speculation about Labour by saying the PM's views on a\n\ndate were unchanged and he would urge people to support the position he had set\n\nout.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nBridget Jones was never going to get a tax break out of David Cameron. The prime\n\nminister believes in marriage, and he wants to introduce a married couples' tax\n\nbreak to prove it. After much prevarication, owing to the political difficulties\n\nof getting the policy through, Cameron is now bringing forward to the autumn\n\nlegislation to recognise marriage in the tax system.\n\n\n\nSo all you Bridget Joneses out there can now add to your list of grievances the\n\nfact that you won't qualify for a tax rebate that your smug married friends will\n\nbe boasting about.\n\n\n\nI know Cameron believes in this policy personally and passionately because I\n\nonce sat in the back of a car with him and listened to him nagging a\n\ntwentysomething female aide about why she hadn't yet found a husband. \"We really\n\nmust get you married. Marriage is wonderful,\" he said, with great feeling.\n\n\n\nIt may yet be the case that in rushing out an announcement on this most\n\ntraditional policy, against the wishes of ministers including George Osborne,\n\nCameron shows himself to be in tune with the British people - who have a soft\n\nspot for marriage and want it promoted.\n\n\n\nCertainly, the prime minister has done himself proud recently by sticking to\n\ninstinctive Tory values. His stance on Europe and welfare cutbacks - both of\n\nwhich Labour predicted would be unpopular - have won enthusiastic backing from\n\nvoters. Ed Miliband has looked out of touch in refusing to back an EU referendum\n\nand by not having a cohesive alternative to counter financial austerity. Polling\n\nlast weekend showed the Labour party leader lacking the power to secure a\n\nCommons majority.\n\n\n\nBut there is something about a marriage tax break that makes me doubt its\n\npopulist appeal. Perhaps because I am a singleton myself, I have deeply\n\nconflicted feelings about financially rewarding \"smug marrieds\", as Bridget\n\nJones calls them.\n\n\n\nI don't oppose it completely, however, because whatever the idealist Cameron\n\nbelieves, a married couples' tax break is essentially a tax break for the middle\n\nclasses. The reason the idea has gathered so much pace within the Tory party,\n\nwhich was poised to revolt if Cameron did not act, is because it is the only\n\nway, in the current financial climate, the Conservatives can legitimately - and\n\nwith moral authority - get a tax cut through for \"people like them\". In\n\nprinciple that is fine by me. The middle classes deserve a tax break. They've\n\nbeen paying into the system more diligently than anyone else for years.\n\n\n\nMy problem is that if you want to give middle Britons some of their hard-earned\n\nmoney back, give it to them honestly and up front. Say you want to reward\n\nresponsible people on medium incomes and be done with it.\n\n\n\nThe problem with dressing up a tax cut for the middle classes as \"marriage tax\n\nbreaks\" is that it excludes some very worthy groups of people, namely wives\n\ndeserted by their husbands, husbands deserted by their wives and the children of\n\nthose sad, broken unions. It also further stigmatises that fast-growing\n\ndemographic - the single person who fails, through no fault of their own, to\n\nfind a mate. To judge if a taxpayer deserves some slack according to whether or\n\nnot they have persuaded a partner to walk down the aisle seems very arbitrary\n\nwhen fewer people than ever make a go of wedlock.\n\n\n\nAh but, the marriage tax proponents say, if only marriage carried tax incentives\n\nit would be more popular and last longer. Would these enthusiasts please point\n\nme to one example of a separated couple they can honestly say would rediscover\n\ntheir love of each other if they were given Â£150 a year. Bickering, angry,\n\nresentful lovers do not stay together for the sake of an extra Â£12.50 a week\n\n(the sum mooted when the idea was in the Tory manifesto).\n\n\n\nMore pertinently, perhaps, this policy has no effect on the problem families we\n\nreally need to help lower down the socio-economic scale. Take the young couple I\n\nsaw in my local park in south London the other day, screaming at each other in\n\nfront of their frightened toddler: she accusing him of beating her up, he barely\n\nable to walk or speak, presumably because of the influence of drink or drugs.\n\nThese are the couples we need to make stable, but the reality of their lives\n\nwill not be altered by telling them they can share a tax-free allowance. Married\n\ncouples are a self-selecting social group.\n\n\n\nAs I say, I don't mind rewarding the middle classes per se. But there is one\n\nmore reason why the Conservative party should be cautious. The spectre of \"back\n\nto basics\". You pose an interesting moral question as a politician if you reward\n\nmarriage through the tax and benefits system. You inevitably draw attention to\n\nyour own union. You put the spotlight on the marriages of those in the cabinet\n\nand, indeed, of all MPs who vote through such legislation. Suddenly, rumours of\n\na \"high-profile affair in Downing Street\" might become all the more intriguing.\n\nWhispers about a senior cabinet minister who has had a fling and put his wife\n\nthrough hell become more than gossip. They become an important part of a policy\n\ndebate.\n\n\n\nIs marriage a state-sponsored benefit, a matter for public policy, or a\n\nwell-intentioned but fraught personal arrangement that a growing number of\n\ncouples are finding hard to abide by?\n\n\n\nTo wit: do you take this marriage tax break as your lawfully wedded policy, to\n\nhave and to hold through scurrilous tabloid revelations? It is a brave\n\npolitician who says \"I do\".\n\n\n\nMelissa Kite is contributing editor of the Spectator\n\n\n\n",

The EU referendum private members' bill\n\nbeing proposed by Conservative MP James Wharton could have been a great moment\n\nfor Britain's parliament, undermined in recent years by expenses and lobbying\n\nscandals. It could have been one of those critical moments when MPs put aside\n\npartisan differences for the common good. But it won't be.\n\n\n\nThe Conservatives have chosen to make their bill all blue. One by one, Labour\n\nMPs who joined us in supporting the Labour for a Referendum campaign have been\n\nrebuffed. The first prime minister to promise a referendum on the EU since\n\nHarold Wilson is now in danger of becoming a major obstacle to one actually\n\nhappening.\n\n\n\nThe bill will, of course, pass easily on Friday. But it will do so with meagre\n\ncross-party support. Bringing Labour on board would have given it a fighting\n\nchance while it goes through committee and then returns to the Commons for\n\nanother vote in the autumn. However, David Cameron's partisan meddling with this\n\nbackbencher's bill has left many MPs from other parties in a position where they\n\nfeel they simply cannot support it; and that means it will struggle to become\n\nlaw.\n\n\n\nI have spent a good deal of my adult life campaigning for an EU referendum. I\n\nhave done so because as a businessman - I founded and am the chair of the\n\nconsumer products and shopping channel company JML - I feel the EU too often\n\nhinders and frustrates economic growth in Britain; and because as a British\n\ncitizen, I think Brussels intrudes into too many aspects of our daily lives. But\n\nmostly I have done so because the organisation Britain joined in 1973 has become\n\na very different animal, and it's only right that the general public get their\n\nsay on these huge changes.\n\n\n\nRegular polls and the meteoric rise of Ukip have shown that Britain's membership\n\nof the EU is a crucial matter not just for Conservative voters. In the past few\n\nmonths one of the campaigns I chair, Business for Britain, has demonstrated that\n\nthere is a strong feeling in the business community that Britain's relationship\n\nwith Brussels must undergo a fundamental change. I helped set up Labour for a\n\nReferendum because I feel the Labour party will soon also recognise the\n\nimperative for a new deal from the EU. Indeed, it seems the shadow cabinet is\n\nnow seriously considering backing a referendum in the coming months.\n\n\n\nYet, despite all this evidence that the EU issue stretches across partisan,\n\ngenerational and personal boundaries, the Conservatives have made only scant\n\neffort to embrace this new cross-party reality. Unfortunately, the referendum\n\nbill now looks more like a Tory PR operation than a genuine movement for\n\nconstitutional change. Unhappily, it gives greater credence to the suspicion\n\nthat Cameron's promise of a referendum in January was not because he believes it\n\nis the right thing to do, but rather because he wanted to placate his vociferous\n\nbackbenchers. I'm pleased that Labour's hesitance to match his pledge is\n\nseemingly based on ensuring it would be held at a time that would not be\n\ndetrimental to the British economy.\n\n\n\nThere is still time for Cameron. Time to reach out to Labour and allow James\n\nWharton to build up the undeniable cross-party support that exists. With greater\n\nnumbers of Labour MPs coming around to the idea of a referendum, and party\n\nadvisers openly preparing the way for a Labour pledge before 2015, the door is\n\nopen for the sort of coalition the country can be proud of to vote through a\n\nreferendum and let the people decide on the EU.\n\n\n\nBut will they dare?\n\n\n\nJohn Mills is the founder and chair of JML and a Labour party donor\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Croatia could have chosen the moment for its accession to the European Union,\n\nit would not be 1 July 2013. The Pew Research Centre has just published the\n\nresults of polling conducted in eight EU member states. The most disturbing\n\nfinding is that the percentage of citizens in favour of the European project has\n\nplummeted from 60% a year ago to 45% now. A failing economy, Europe's\n\nnorth-south divide and distrust of the political elite have led to such results.\n\n\n\nThen there are the consequences of Romania and Bulgaria joining the EU in 2007\n\nwithout adequate preparation. Disappointment with the two new members was\n\nfollowed by a more sceptical approach to further accessions. As it is, the EU\n\nhas had enough problems with former communist countries, and now yet another one\n\nis joining. Yes, Croatia is smaller and perhaps better prepared, but enthusiasm\n\nis nevertheless lacking on both sides.\n\n\n\nWhen the newly independent nation began the negotiation process, Croatians\n\nregarded the EU like a rich aunt. After all, they always thought of membership\n\nnot as coming in but coming back. But even so, the nationalist opposition was\n\nfairly vocal. Why join a new community of states just after leaving Yugoslavia,\n\nand a bloody war that had cost thousands of lives? If the 1991-95 wars were for\n\nindependence, then why give up that newly won political sovereignty? And what\n\nabout the Croatian national identity that had been reinvented and celebrated\n\nwith so much energy by the first president, Franjo Tudjman?\n\n\n\nHowever, the political elite at the time presented it in ideological terms:\n\nCroatia does not belong to the Balkans. The Balkans are the Others - Orthodox\n\nand Muslims, not Catholics. Joining the EU would reinforce the difference, and\n\n\"draw the line\" between them and us. This must be the only reason Croatia's\n\nCatholic church supported the yes vote in last year's referendum, when 66% voted\n\nto join the EU.\n\n\n\nIn later years, though, the important if not crucial argument about peace and\n\nstability was neglected more and more. Politicians of both right and left chose\n\nto perpetuate a rosy picture of economic benefits, investments, employment\n\nopportunities and so on. Yet with accession approaching, it became clear that\n\nthis was not going to happen. The economic crisis in the EU coincided with\n\nnegative results from the badly handled privatisation of state assets, with\n\nallegations of political corruption. The state bureaucracy is huge and no reform\n\nhas touched it. Unemployment climbed to 20% and is still rising. Over half those\n\nunemployed are young people. The public debt is almost 60% of GDP. No wonder\n\nGermany fears Croatia is a future Greece.\n\n\n\nCroatians themselves seem not to be in the mood to celebrate. In this last month\n\nbefore joining the EU, the media expressed anxiety, for instance about the\n\nlikely competitiveness of our products - although our main industry, tourism, is\n\ndoing well. One could sense an atmosphere of closing instead of opening, of fear\n\ninstead of joy.\n\n\n\nThe only people looking forward to joining the EU seem to be young people, who\n\nanticipate the possibilities of study and work abroad - there will be no more\n\ncustoms at our western borders, no more queueing up in non-EU queues for those\n\nwho have money to shop and to travel.\n\n\n\nIt looks as if in the whole process of accession the most important elements\n\nwere \"lost in transition\". Beyond Croatia being Europe's long-lost Catholic\n\nchild, the fact is that the country was at war only two decades ago, and that\n\npeace and security should mean more to it than putative economic gains. Economic\n\nsurvival for this small and poor state would be even harder outside the union.\n\nThis is why 1 July is a historic date, even if the actual moment of joining is\n\nreally not the best one either for Croatia or for the EU.\n\n\n\nSlavenka Drakulic is a Croatian author\n\n\n\n",

At the time the outflow\n\nwas running at over euros 1bn (Â£847m) a day.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, has said he may have to seek a\n\nreferendum asking the Irish people for greater government powers to investigate\n\nthe banking crash that almost bankrupted Ireland.\n\n\n\nSpeaking in the Dail the taoiseach said he was considering a second referendum\n\nthat would grant the state more power to hold searching inquiries.\n\n\n\nThe tapes appear to confirm that Anglo Irish bankers hoodwinked the then Fianna\n\nFail-led government back in 2008 with a vastly underestimated price for the bank\n\nrescue. John Bowe, then the bank's director of capital markets, is heard on the\n\ntapes explaining where got the figure of euros 7bn needed to save Anglo Irish\n\nfrom oblivion.\n\n\n\nHe quips that he picked the figure \"out of my arse\".\n\n\n\nIn fact, Anglo Irish Bank's rescue cost the Irish and European taxpayers,\n\nparticularly the Germans, euros 30bn.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\n'We are offended.

By offering the\n\nconcession Erdogan appears to be counting on the protests fading. The prime\n\nminister had earlier refused to meet with members of Taksim Solidarity.\n\n\n\nIn a separate development, an Istanbul court released 43 Gezi Park protesters\n\nwho had been arrested, meeting another of the demonstrators' demands.\n\n\n\nErdogan's change in tactics comes a day after the European parliament voted to\n\ncondemn Turkey for the \"harsh measures\" used on demonstrators.\n\n\n\nAlthough the largest wave of protests in recent Turkish history was triggered by\n\na violent crackdown on 31 May on environmental campaigners occupying the park,\n\nthe protests have since been transformed into a wider, if loose, coalition of\n\nthose opposed to Erdogan and his ruling moderate Islamist AKP, whom they accuse\n\nof creeping authoritarianism.\n\n\n\nThe promise of a breakthrough emerged in a series of meetings in the capital,\n\nAnkara, and Istanbul. In Ankara, Erdogan met artists and representatives of\n\nTaksim Solidarity, named after the square adjoining Gezi Park that has been the\n\nfocus for the worst clashes. Huseyin Celik, deputy chairman of the AKP who\n\nattended the talks, said the meeting had been positive but reiterated Erdogan's\n\nposition that the occupation has to end.\n\n\n\n\"Our government has been very tolerant, as tolerant as it goes in a democracy,\n\nbut I don't think the government will leave that place under occupation for\n\nlong,\" he said.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Taksim Square was cleared by police with water cannon,\n\nteargas and rubber bullets in some of the worst scenes of violence in the\n\nprotests.\n\n\n\nIn Istanbul, the city's governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu also held a five-hour\n\nmidnight meeting with young protesters invited via Twitter at a cafe on the\n\nshores of the Bosphorous to hear their complaints.\n\n\n\n\"We felt they showed sensitivity . . . and did not have an unyielding stance\n\nregarding staying there (in the park),\" Mutlu told reporters. Signs of movement\n\nto end the two-week standoff prompted a rally on the Turkish stock market.\n\n\n\nProtesters in the park have tentatively welcomed the moves by Erdogan as the\n\n\"first positive sign\".\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of Taksim Solidarity who attended the meeting said Erdogan had\n\npromised to abide by the outcome of a court case filed in an effort to stop the\n\nredevelopment and would hold a referendum on the plans if the court found in the\n\ngovernment's favour. \"The prime minister said that if the results of the public\n\nvote turned out in a way which would leave this area as a park, they will abide\n\nby it,\" Tayfun Kahraman of the protest group told reporters following the\n\nmeeting.\n\n\n\n\"His comments that the project will not be executed until the judiciary makes\n\nits decision is tonight's positive result.\"\n\n\n\nTaksim Solidarity said in a subsequent statement that it would decide as a whole\n\nwhat course of action to take after consulting on the results of the overnight\n\nmeeting, leaving it unclear whether it would continue protesting.\n\n\n\nThe pledge by Erdogan - whose party plans rallies in Ankara and elsewhere this\n\nweekend - suggests he has calculated that he can defuse the current political\n\ncrisis by putting the onus on the courts, not his own damaged political\n\nreputation, and hope that there is insufficient agreement among those in the\n\npark on other issues for the occupation to continue.\n\n\n\nBut a poll of those in Gezi Park this week suggested that almost half were there\n\nbecause of their unhappiness with Erdogan's style of government.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, delivered a stark \"final warning\"\n\nyesterday to thousands of defiant protesters still camped out in Istanbul's Gezi\n\npark, demanding that they end their occupation.\n\n\n\nDescribing the protesters as troublemakers, Erdogan said the government had\n\nreached the \"end of its patience\" over the continuing demonstrations against his\n\nleadership, in which five people have been killed since 31 May. Erdogan had\n\nearlier issued a 24-hour deadline to clear Taksim Square and Gezi park.\n\n\n\nHe spoke as the latest person to die in the demonstrations was named as\n\n26-year-old Ethem Sarisuluk, who had been on life support for days. He was\n\npronounced dead after he was hit in the head by a tear gas canister on 1 June\n\nduring a protest in the capital, Ankara.\n\n\n\nThe protests erupted after a violent police crackdown on 31 May following a\n\nsit-in by activists objecting to a development project that would involve\n\ncutting down the trees in Gezi park and replacing them with a replica of an\n\nOttoman-era barracks. Since then, protests have spread to dozens of cities and\n\nbeen transformed into a broader complaint over Erdogan's style of government.\n\n\n\nErdogan also hit out at criticism overseas of the force being used. The European\n\nparliament has voted to condemn the use of \"harsh measures\" against peaceful\n\nprotesters and urged Erdogan to take a unifying and conciliatory stance.\n\n\n\n\"We have arrived at the end of our patience,\" Erdogan told local party leaders\n\nin a speech in Ankara yesterday. \"I am giving you my final warning.\"\n\n\n\nHe urged parents with children at the park to convince them to pack up and go\n\nhome. He added that he had instructed police that \"we cannot allow lawbreakers\n\nto hang around freely in this square . . . We will clean the square\".\n\n\n\nResponding to the vote in the European parliament in Strasbourg, Erdogan added:\n\n\"I won't recognise the decision that the European Union parliament is going to\n\ntake about us . . . Who do you think you are by taking such a decision?\"\n\n\n\nAlthough there were no fresh clashes yesterday, many have interpreted Erdogan's\n\nremarks as a clear signal that he will move soon to clear the park of\n\nprotesters.\n\n\n\nA new poll of those occupying Gezi park suggests that almost 60% are protesting\n\nabout Erdogan's style of government, which opponents have criticised for its\n\ncreeping authoritarianism.\n\n\n\nDespite the warnings, new protesters of all ages continued to arrive in the\n\ncamp, insisting they would not be frightened away.\n\n\n\nAmong them was Kerim Ozken, 63, a retired bank worker and writer. \"I think the\n\npolice might attack again tonight,\" he said, reflecting the fears of many in the\n\ncamp. \"Tayyip (Erdogan) said it will be over tonight. He thinks it is a war. It\n\nis idiotic. Really idiotic. He thinks he can change people's minds by force.\"\n\n\n\nSo far during the protests, 5,000 protesters and 600 police have been reported\n\ninjured.\n\n\n\nErdogan's defiant tone comes despite the floating of a proposal to have a\n\npopular referendum on the fate of the park. Pouring cold water on that notion, a\n\nsenior judge insisted that the courts had already ruled on the development.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nThe Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, hit out at the European\n\nparliament's criticism of his 'harsh measures'\n\n\n\n",

The Labour decision was denounced as weak by the\n\nTory chairman, Grant Shapps.\n\n\n\nWharton has said he thinks his bill has a 50-50 chance of getting onto the\n\nstatute book, but the Labour abstention will help the bill get through to its\n\nnext stage of detailed examination in committee.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Riga a copper figure of Latvia's mythical maiden soars skyward holding three\n\ngolden stars. Nicknamed Milda, she stands at the top of the Freedom Monument,\n\nsymbolising the Baltic country's hard-won liberty and independence.\n\n\n\nFrom next January Milda will become a more familiar face across Europe when her\n\nlikeness is stamped on to euros 1 and euros 2 coins to mark Latvia becoming the\n\n18th member of a single currency zone which may, or may not, be emerging from a\n\nthree-year period of fighting for its life.\n\n\n\nFor Greece or Portugal, the euro may have seemed like a prison in recent years.\n\nBut for Latvia, or at least for its government and elite, the maiden-faced\n\ncurrency will symbolise freedom and independence, reinforcing the vulnerable\n\nsmall country's integration in the west and another big step in liberating\n\nitself from its historical tormentor, Russia.\n\n\n\nThe European commission and the European Central Bank (ECB), in their\n\n\"convergence reports\" last week, gave a green light to Latvia to join in\n\nJanuary. EU finance ministers are expected to rubber-stamp that decision next\n\nmonth. This week the ratings agency Standard & Poor's responded by raising its\n\nrating on the country's debt from BBB to BBB+, which is three levels above junk.\n\n\n\nEstonia adopted the euro 30 months ago. Lithuania intends to follow suit in\n\n2015. While a year or two ago the smart money was on the eurozone shrinking to\n\n15, within a couple of years the likelihood is a membership of 19, plus a\n\ncampaign gearing up in Poland to take the club to 20.\n\n\n\nFor Valdis Dombrovskis, Latvia's prime minister, joining the euro makes economic\n\nsense. It will bring budget savings, promote foreign direct investment and\n\nunderpin the recovery from an economic collapse in 2008-9 that foreshadowed\n\ncalamities to come elsewhere, especially in Ireland and Spain. But it's not all\n\nfinance and economics. For the Baltic states, long at the mercy of an imperial\n\nRussia, whether tsarist or communist, and perennially wary of Vladimir Putin,\n\nthe euro is also political.\n\n\n\nDombrovskis agrees with Olli Rehn, the economics commissioner in Brussels who\n\nwhen giving the green light stressed that Latvia would gain rather than forfeit\n\nsovereignty by having a seat at the ECB and in the meetings of eurozone finance\n\nministers.\n\n\n\nIt might be an argument that would fall flat in Athens or Lisbon, but Latvia's\n\nnational currency, the lats, has been pegged to the euro for eight years -\n\nmeaning monetary policy has been effectively set in Frankfurt without Riga\n\nhaving any say.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, opinion polls consistently show a majority against joining the\n\neuro. Dombrovskis brushes aside opposition calls for a referendum, arguing that\n\nthe voters made their choice clear for Latvia's entering the EU in 2004 and the\n\nentry terms included a commitment to joining the currency when the time was\n\nright and criteria were met.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt Latvia passes muster; indeed the economic data puts most\n\ncurrent eurozone countries to shame, Germany included. At just over 40% of gross\n\ndomestic product (GDP), the national debt is well below the eurozone's 60%\n\nceiling, while the budget deficit is a mere 1.2%, comfortably within the 3% rule\n\nthat in any case these days is honoured mainly in the breach.\n\n\n\nRiga initially wanted to join in 2008 but was floored by the financial collapse\n\nin the EU. The country of 2 million was the first in the EU to seek a bailout -\n\nfrom Brussels and the International Monetary Fund - of euros 7.5bn (Â£6.4bn) when\n\na housing and consumption bubble, fuelled by cheap credit from the Swedish and\n\nDanish banks that dominate the Baltic banking sector, burst and sent the economy\n\ninto a tailspin.\n\n\n\nIn 2008-9 the economy shrank by 25%, civil service jobs were slashed, wages cut,\n\nsocial, education, and health services axed. Unemployment quadrupled; property\n\nprices collapsed by up to 70%; an estimated 10% of the population, mainly young\n\npeople, emigrated.\n\n\n\nIn five years Latvia has been from boom to bust and, relatively speaking, back\n\nto boom. The third poorest country in the EU, it is also the fastest growing,\n\nnotching up 5% growth last year.\n\n\n\nDombrovskis argues that the recovery is solid and sustainable, based on\n\nmanufacturing and exports and not the easy credit of the boom years of the last\n\ndecade. The European commission and the ECB appear to agree, but the latter in\n\nparticular is worried about Latvia being a potential money-laundering Trojan\n\nhorse within the eurozone. It points to the high level of foreign deposits in\n\nLatvian banks, euros 10bn - half of their total deposits and worth 40% of GDP.\n\n\n\nThe deposits are overwhelmingly Russian, as Latvia is also a playground for\n\noligarchs and underworld figures who feel at home in a country where one in four\n\nare ethnic Russians. The US state department has warned of \"a systemic\n\nmoney-laundering risk\".\n\n\n\nSimilar concerns about Russian money played a large part in the recent Cyprus\n\ndisaster, but the scale of the problem is quite different. Bank deposits in\n\nCyprus amounted to eight times the country's GDP; in Latvia the equivalent\n\nfigure is 1.5.\n\n\n\nLatvia's recovery from a collapse as steep as Greece's and its current status as\n\nthe EU's fastest growing economy has spurred talk that it is the model to follow\n\nfor stricken eurozone countries.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presidents of the two entities on the divided island of Cyprus sat down with\n\ntheir wives last week for an unusual dinner. Held in the buffer zone that\n\nseparates the Turkish-run statelet from the Greek Cypriots who control most of\n\nthe island, it was hosted by the United Nations in a brave attempt to renew\n\nnegotiations on ending one of the world's longest \"frozen conflicts\".\n\n\n\nThe catastrophic financial bailout and the row over the European Union-IMF plan\n\nto sequester a chunk of depositors' cash have dominated recent news from Cyprus,\n\nor at least from the 60% of the island that is in the eurozone. But the legacy\n\nfrom a Greek Cypriot coup attempt in 1974 and the invasion and occupation by\n\nTurkish troops is still the country's biggest problem.\n\n\n\nNo peace proposals were on the table at last week's dinner, which the Greek\n\nCypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, insisted should be purely a social event.\n\nElected in February, Anastasiades claims he needs more time to prepare for\n\nnegotiations, but he reluctantly agreed to meet Dervis Eroglu, the head of the\n\nself-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, in a getting-to-know-you\n\nsession - spouses also welcome - provided no politics disturbed the occasion.\n\n\n\nWhy he is so hesitant is obscure. The argument that his community's economic\n\ncrisis is so complex that time does not permit him to concentrate on peace talks\n\ndoes not hold much water. The issues have been thrashed out at inordinate length\n\nover the years by a series of UN mediators, the latest of these being Alexander\n\nDowner, a former foreign minister of Australia.\n\n\n\nThe best chance of success came in 2004 when the then UN secretary general Kofi\n\nAnnan produced a plan for a federation of the two parts of the island that was\n\nput to a referendum. Nearly two-thirds of Turks supported it but, to the\n\nsurprise of almost everyone on the island as well as of diplomats, less than a\n\nquarter of the Greeks did.\n\n\n\nOne irony of the buffer zone soiree was that Eroglu was in the minority of Turks\n\nin 2004 who campaigned for a \"no\" vote but now seems eager for a settlement,\n\nwhile Anastasiades was brave enough to campaign for a \"yes\" vote. Today,\n\nhowever, Anastasiades refuses to say whether he supports the Annan plan, even as\n\na basis for further negotiations. Indeed his party recently backed new\n\npin-pricks against the Turkish side when parliament passed a bill that would\n\ndeny free medical treatment to Turkish Cypriots who come over to the south for\n\ncomplex operations that are not available in the less developed north.\n\n\n\nThe sums of money saved are piffling, and the move ran against the spirit of the\n\nopening of inter-communal borders that began in 2003 and has alleviated some of\n\nthe pain of division for the last decade.\n\n\n\nAnastasiades has sent his foreign minister to London and other western capitals\n\nin recent weeks to explain the case for delay in starting new peace talks, while\n\nthe Turkish Cypriots have sent their chief negotiator around a similar circuit\n\narguing the opposite.\n\n\n\nThe US, which plays the major role, seem to favour urgency. \"I would hope that\n\nrather than preventing people from moving forward, the economic crisis in fact\n\nopens up opportunities,\" said the US secretary of state, John Kerry, as he stood\n\nbeside the Greek Cypriot foreign minister.\n\n\n\nLike other outside players, Washington believes a potential new key to peace\n\nlies in the discovery of huge gas reserves off Cyprus's coast. Without agreement\n\non the island's future and the sharing of revenues between the two communities,\n\ninvestors will be reluctant to commit funds to develop them. Nor will there be\n\nmoney to lay the pipeline needed to export the gas. The Turkish Cypriots say a\n\npipeline to Turkey and thence to Europe is the cheapest and most logical\n\nsolution. The Greek Cypriots are toying with a pipeline to Israel.\n\n\n\nWhether the gas finds turn out to be a political blessing or a curse is hard to\n\npredict. Cypriot leaders on both sides have exasperated international mediators\n\nfor decades, and the prospect of hydrocarbon riches may produce more stupidity\n\nthan sense once again.\n\n\n\nAnastasiades's behaviour is hardly encouraging. Take his reaction to the 77-page\n\ndocument that the UN recently sent him, outlining all the \"convergences\" between\n\nthe Turkish and Greek Cypriot positions that mediators had identified during the\n\nfour years of talks under Anastasiades's predecessor, Demetris Christofias.\n\nInstead of treating it as useful, Anastasiades accused Downer of trying to\n\nundermine his credibility and threatened to pull out of the dinner.\n\n\n\nAnastasiades is in a coalition government and under pressure from other\n\npolitical parties - but this only tends to strengthen the view, held by many\n\nobservers, that the Greek Cypriot elite has become comfortable with the\n\ndeadlock. The south was living far better than the north, while having a divided\n\nand occupied island gave Greek Cypriots international standing as victims.\n\n\n\nIf that is the mood, it is time to think again. Standing clear of the eurozone,\n\nthe northern Cyprus economy is growing while the south is doomed to a decade of\n\nrecession. At least as much as the discovery of gas, the harsh twist in the\n\nsouth's euro fortunes ought to spur its leaders to go for peace.\n\n\n\nJonathan Steele is a former chief foreign correspondent for the Guardian\n\n\n\n",

More immediately, Obama administration officials were\n\nconcerned that the uncertainty over Britain's future would further complicate\n\nwhat is already a hard sell in Congress, threatening a central pledge in the\n\npresident's state of the union address in February.\n\n\n\nWith formal negotiations expected to start within weeks, the state department\n\nalready has hundreds of staff working on the partnership. Sources at US-UK\n\nmeetings in London last week said American officials had made it clear that it\n\nwould take a monumental effort to get TTIP through a suspicious Congress and\n\nthat \"there would very little appetite\" in Washington for doing it all again\n\nwith the UK if Britain walked out of Europe.\n\n\n\n\"Having Britain in the EU . . . is going to strengthen the possibility that we\n\nsucceed in a very difficult negotiation, as it involves so many different\n\ninterests and having Britain as a key player and pushing for this will be\n\nimportant,\" a senior US official said. \"We have expressed our views of Britain's\n\nrole in the EU and they haven't changed. TTIP negotiations underscore why we\n\nthink it's important that it continues.\"\n\n\n\nUS officials say that the White House is particularly perplexed because Britain\n\nplayed a key role in persuading Obama to stake significant political capital on\n\nthe ambitious transatlantic partnership. If it is successful it could be the\n\nbiggest trade and investment deal in history, encompassing half the world's GDP\n\nand a third of its trade.\n\n\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic there is hope that the boost provided by removing\n\nremaining barriers to US-EU trade and investment would help lift the west, and\n\nthen the global economy, out of the doldrums.\n\n\n\nWriting in the US press this year, the British ambassador to Washington, Sir\n\nPeter Westmacott, said \"a bold and comprehensive deal could be worth 1%-2% in\n\nadditional GDP on both sides of the Atlantic. Even a 1% bump would translate, at\n\ncurrent GDP levels, into an extra $325bn.\" He added that the UK shared the Obama\n\nadministration's optimism that it could be completed in less than two years.\n\n\n\nAddressing the Senate last week, the US under-secretary of state for economic\n\ngrowth, energy and the environment, Robert Hormats, said the TTIP \"is, in many\n\nrespects, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape our relationship with\n\nthe European Union\". Hormats added it \"will enhance our ability to build\n\nstronger relationships with emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere around the\n\nworld\".\n\n\n\nBoth European and American officials involved in preparatory talks on the\n\npartnership said it was also intended as a bulwark against the economic\n\nchallenge of China, aimed at forming a bloc powerful enough to lay down the\n\nrules of international trade and investment.\n\n\n\nThey pointed to the fact that Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan,\n\nflew to Washington this month specifically to try to persuade Obama to include\n\nhis country in negotiations. Officials said this was a reflection of the\n\ngravitational pull the partnership could exert on the rest of the world.\n\n\n\nÂ£10bn\n\n\n\nThe amount of money that is said to be at stake a year for the UK from the new\n\nUS-EU trade and investment partnership\n\n\n\n",

Among party leaders' voters, Cameron enjoys by far the greatest confidence\n\n(80%), while only 25% of Lib Dem voters think Clegg is the most likely to\n\nsucceed. However, 20% of the British public say that none of the party leaders\n\nlisted would be likely to succeed in negotiating a better deal for Britain.\n\n\n\nIf a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU were held now, the poll\n\nsuggests 37% of the electorate would vote to remain in, compared with 41% who\n\nwould back an exit. But if there were a significant return of powers to\n\nWestminster followed by a referendum, 47% would vote to stay, while 32% would\n\nvote to leave.\n\n\n\nThe most favoured option, with 38% support, is a renegotiation to remain an EU\n\nmember but outside the eurozone. By contrast one in four (26%) say Britain\n\nshould withdraw from the EU completely. Almost two-fifths (18%) would like to\n\nmaintain the current relationship, while 6% would prefer closer integration,\n\nwith Britain adopting the single currency.\n\n\n\nMore than half (55%) of the British public believe the priority in any\n\nrenegotiation should be an independent UK immigration policy. Other areas of\n\npriority include giving Westminster more powers to block unwanted EU laws (42%),\n\nreducing Britain's contribution to the EU budget (36%) and allowing the UK to\n\nhave sole control over criminal justice laws (32%).\n\n\n\nAmong those British adults certain to vote in the European elections Ukip would\n\ncome first (27%) and Labour second (23%). The Conservatives would come third\n\nwith 21%. Almost two-fifths (39%) of those who voted Tory in the 2009 European\n\nelections would back Ukip if the poll were held tomorrow - suggesting Cameron\n\nmay be doing the right thing in seeking to underline how he would renegotiate\n\nBritain's relationship.\n\n\n\nOpen Europe's director, Mats Persson, said: \"Whilst the Conservatives may be\n\nheading for a perfect storm in the EU elections, their overarching goal of a\n\nrenegotiated position for the UK in the EU still enjoys substantial support from\n\nacross the political spectrum.\n\n\n\nComRes interviewed 2,003 adults online between 22 and 24 May.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\n80% of Tory voters polled believe David Cameron is most likely to secure the\n\nbest deal for Britain from the EU\n\n\n\n",

He said MPs in marginal seats would be\n\nunsettled if the prime minister had failed to turn around the party's fortunes\n\nat the ballot box next year.\n\n\n\nRuffley told Sky's Murnaghan programme: \"I think next May's Euro elections might\n\nput pressure on him to go harder because there is a lot of speculation in and\n\naround Downing Street, so I am led to believe, that Ukip might come first.\n\n\n\n\"Now if that happens next May there'll be 12 months before the election and some\n\nof our colleagues in marginal seats might get a bit windy. I don't think Ukip\n\nare going to win seats but they could split the Conservative vote if they are\n\nstrong and let Labour through in those marginal seats.\"\n\n\n\nRuffley said the Conservative party would give him time to see if his EU\n\nreferendum bill reached the statute book.\n\n\n\nA ComRes poll in January put Labour on 35% (up 19 percentage points on its\n\nperformance at the 2009 European elections), Ukip on 23% (up six) Conservatives\n\non 22% (down six) and Liberal Democrats on 8% (down five).\n\n\n\nThe Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, has already promised a political earthquake if\n\nhis party tops the poll next year. The regional list electoral system used in\n\nthe European elections is suited to Ukip because the party matters more than the\n\nindividuals who get elected. Ukip is currently favourite to win.\n\n\n\nPrescott intervened in the European debate, writing in the Mirror over the\n\nweekend: \"Cameron thought he was shooting Ukip's fox by offering a referendum.\n\nAll they want to do is save their seats in 2015. So Labour should call his\n\nbluff. We should continue to put the economy, jobs and the national interest\n\nfirst.\n\n\n\n\"That's why Ed Miliband should call for an in-out referendum on Europe. Not to\n\nbe held in 2017 but NOW!\n\n\n\n\"Labour could still continue to argue the need for reforming Europe during the\n\ndebate. Like the 1975 referendum, this would be a consultative poll, with\n\nparliament making the final decision. A public vote either way could strengthen\n\nour negotiation position for reform with our European partners.\n\n\n\n\"I believe during a referendum campaign, after both sides have been put, more\n\npeople will decide to stay, just as they did in 1975.\"\n\n\n\n23%\n\n\n\nUkip opinion poll rating for the European elections according to a ComRes\n\nsurvey, just ahead of the Conservatives\n\n\n\n",

Feldman categorically denies making the remarks which were\n\nreported, though not attributed to him, in the Times and the Daily Telegraph on\n\nSaturday.\n\n\n\nOne MP said it was difficult to see how Cameron could turn around his fortunes\n\nafter a series of setbacks, not helped when he appointed two more Etonians to\n\nhis inner circle. \"What is Cameron going to do? Rescind the Etonian hirings, say\n\nI am not a snob? Of course not. This feels terminal. I can't predict how it will\n\nhappen but it feels like we are nearing the end.\"\n\n\n\nTories say the atmosphere in the parliamentary party has changed over the past\n\nweek after a consensus had been formed around Easter that the prime minister was\n\nsecure at least until next year's European parliamentary elections, which Ukip\n\nis expected to win. The successful budget and the prime minister's widely\n\npraised handling of the death of Lady Thatcher prompted opponents to back down.\n\n\n\nBut senior figures are saying Cameron's handling of the EU referendum vote, in\n\nwhich he conceded that a bill should be passed in this parliament after\n\ninitially saying this was unnecessary, had weakened him even in the eyes of\n\nEurosceptics. The vote on gay marriage, in which Cameron was forced to negotiate\n\nwith Labour to protect a bill which is widely despised in the party, did little\n\nto help matters.\n\n\n\nOne MP said: \"People felt that things were moving in the right way. But we keep\n\nmucking up. It is all mucking it up from an elitist perspective.\n\n\n\n\"Trying to be all things to all men doesn't work. This culture of 'we know\n\nbetter than you' is unacceptable.\"\n\n\n\nOthers talk of \"tectonic plates\" - the phrase used by John Prescott to signal\n\nthe end of the Blair era - shifting. \"Certainly the tremors are reverberating,\"\n\none said.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nLord Feldman denies that he described party activists as 'swivel-eyed loons'\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat, and for whom, does today's - and tomorrow's - Conservative party stand? In\n\nvarious periods in the past, it has been possible to answer that question with\n\nsome clarity. Before 1832, the party stood for the landed interest. After 1867,\n\nit added the flag, the union and the shopkeeper too. In the first half of the\n\n20th century, the Tories were for empire and against socialism. After 1945, they\n\nbegan an historic compromise with social democracy. After 1979 this was turned\n\non its head, in a break with the one-nation past. Yet, throughout much of its\n\nhistory and most of these twists and turns, the party has embodied the Prince of\n\nSalina's dictum in Lampedusa's novel The Leopard - that things must change in\n\norder that things remain the same. But today?\n\n\n\nThere was a time when David Cameron promised a serious return to the pragmatic\n\ntradition. The years have exposed, sadly in many ways, the shallowness of his\n\nmodernisation project. He embraced progressive and open social principles while\n\nleaving much of the narrow old thinking, which had taken the party to three\n\ncrushing defeats since 1997, untouched. The Tory party that has turned in on\n\nitself again over Europe, and now over the issue of gay marriage, a principled\n\nhappiness-creating reform that is now widely supported, reflects Mr Cameron's\n\nwider failure. It is a party that is pulling against itself, unsure where its\n\nconservatism and its electoral self-interest lie, forgetting that its principal\n\ntask in the voters' eyes is to govern the country well.\n\n\n\nThe enduring narrowness and division are partly Mr Cameron's doing. But they are\n\nin large part Lady Thatcher's poisonous and still not properly recognised\n\nlegacy. All this is reflected both in the leadership's reported taunts against\n\nthe party's \"swivel-eyed loons\" and in the grassroots unhappiness over Mr\n\nCameron's handling of the EU referendum issue, as well as in yesterday's\n\nbackward-looking divisions and contortions over gay rights.\n\n\n\nAll modern political parties face the danger that they can cease to look, feel\n\nand talk like the country they seek to govern. The Tories face this problem in a\n\nparticularly dramatic way. Their membership is either disproportionately\n\nelderly, disproportionately obsessive about one or two issues, or both. As a\n\nresult, they constantly risk appearing - and being - out of touch with the world\n\nthat is inhabited by those whose support they need for re-election. The history\n\nof the past 20 years ought to have taught the Tories, in particular, that they\n\nhave to listen to the electorate, not just the people who share their\n\nprejudices, if they are to broaden their appeal and win elections. Mr Cameron\n\ncame close, but he is now slipping back into the past. As Lord Ashcroft, who is\n\nnothing if not a true Tory, said yesterday, the party urgently needs to move\n\nbeyond Europe and even beyond claiming to be clearing up their predecessors'\n\nmess.\n\n\n\nThree years ago, and with the Labour government increasingly discredited, the\n\ncase for a new government in this country was a plausible one. The voters\n\nagreed, and chose the Conservatives to provide that new start, but not with\n\nfull-hearted confidence, hence the coalition government. The voters' hesitation\n\nhas been richly vindicated. In the past few months, the Tories have turned\n\nincreasingly inward and obsessive. They have been weakly led by Mr Cameron. They\n\nappear far more interested in the threat from Ukip to their party than in the\n\nissues that face the country.\n\n\n\nBut they get the response fundamentally wrong, even to that. The appeal of Ukip\n\nis not confined to either Europe or opposition to gay marriage. It is about\n\nrejecting all the existing parties in difficult times. That is why the Tory\n\nreflex to make stands that expose their divisions may actually boost Ukip rather\n\nthan deflate it. The events of the past 24 hours over gay marriage are a case in\n\npoint. They are a warning of what Lord Ashcroft calls a spiral of irrelevance.\n\nHe is right about that danger. If the Tory party does not pull itself together\n\nvery soon it will have forfeited any case it might still have had for\n\nre-election.\n\n\n\n",

Speaking on The Andrew Marr\n\nShow on BBC1, he said: \"I don't think those views actually represent the\n\nreality. The substance is that the Conservative party says if we are going to be\n\nsuccessful in that global race we need to renegotiate that relationship with\n\nEurope and give the British people a say.\"\n\n\n\nBut Mandelson echoed Howe's warning, though he used a more dramatic analogy. He\n\ntold the Marr Show: \"We all know what's going on inside the Conservative party.\n\nThe UK Isolation party and their fellow travellers in the Conservatives are sort\n\nof operating a Soprano-style protection racket inside the Conservative party.\n\nThey are saying: 'Do what we want, give us what we are demanding, or we are\n\ngoing to burn your home down.'\"\n\n\n\nThe former Northern Ireland secretary even appeared to liken the Eurosceptics to\n\nthe provisional wing of the Irish republican movement. He said: \"Just because\n\none wing - the provisional wing - of the Conservative party want to bring down\n\ntheir leader and change their party's policy and are using this as an issue to\n\ndo so is not a good reason to hold a referendum.\"\n\n\n\nMandelson endorsed Ed Miliband's position on an EU referendum. \"On this issue\n\nthey are right. They are saying yes to a referendum if there is some significant\n\nchange in the relationship. But no, not an in-out referendum just for the sake\n\nof having a referendum.\"\n\n\n\nHunt's and Mandelson's interventions came after Howe lambasted Cameron over\n\nEurope.\n\n\n\nHe wrote in the Observer: \"Sadly, by making it clear in January that he opposes\n\nthe current terms of UK membership of the EU, the prime minister has opened a\n\nPandora's box politically and seems to be losing control of his party in the\n\nprocess.\n\n\n\n\"The ratchet-effect of Euroscepticism has now gone so far that the Conservative\n\nleadership is in effect running scared of its own backbenchers, let alone Ukip,\n\nhaving allowed deep anti-Europeanism to infect the very soul of the party.\"\n\n\n\n",

From that meeting I will\n\ndecide how I will act thereafter.\"\n\n\n\nThe involvement of the board, which represents the views of Tory activists, will\n\ndismay Downing Street after it spent the weekend rubbishing reports in the Times\n\nand Daily Telegraph about Feldman's alleged comments. Feldman described the\n\nreports as \"completely untrue\".\n\n\n\nNo 10 was particularly sensitive because the alleged remarks revived criticism\n\nof the Tory leadership for being aloof and out of touch. Hunt spoke for Downing\n\nStreet when he told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: \"The person who is alleged to\n\nhave said that has denied it and I know the individual and I trust him. \"\n\n\n\nThe unease across the party was highlighted yesterday when 35 current or former\n\nConservative associations handed in a letter to Downing Street that accused the\n\nprime minister of showing \"utter contempt\" for the grassroots activists after\n\npressing ahead with legislation for equal marriage.\n\n\n\nBen Harris-Quinney, the chairman of the Bow Group and director of Conservative\n\nGrassroots, which drummed up support for the letter, said of Feldman's alleged\n\nremarks: \"It doesn't matter who made these comments, the problem is that it\n\ncomes as no surprise and is representative of a wider malaise in the party - the\n\ndisconnect between the leadership and the grassroots, between conservatism and\n\nthe leadership of the Conservative party. The tail cannot continue to wag the\n\ndog.\"\n\n\n\nThe Bow Group, which was founded in 1951, intervened in the wake of Feldman's\n\nalleged remarks on Wednesday night - said to have been made shortly after 116\n\nTory MPs showed their unease with David Cameron over Europe and voted in favour\n\nof an amendment regretting the absence of an EU referendum in the Queen's\n\nspeech.\n\n\n\nTaunted by a journalist about the vote, an unnamed senior member of Cameron's\n\ninner circle was quoted by the Times and the Daily Telegraph as saying: \"It's\n\nfine. There's really no problem. The MPs just have to do it because the\n\nassociations tell them to, and the associations are all mad, swivel-eyed loons.\"\n\n\n\nThe alleged remarks were particularly damaging because they appeared to echo the\n\nprime minister's language. The FT reported in March that Cameron \"tells\n\ncolleagues that anyone who wants to talk to him about the EU is 'swivel-eyed'\".\n\nThe FT article was not challenged by No 10.\n\n\n\nDowning Street said over the weekend that the Times and Telegraph, which\n\nreported the remarks, had no credibility because they had declined to name\n\nFeldman, who admitted talking briefly to journalists at the Intercontinental\n\nHotel at Westminster.\n\n\n\nThe Tory co-chair recognised one of the journalists when he popped out of a\n\nprivate room, where he was attending a dinner hosted by the Conservative Friends\n\nof Pakistan.\n\n\n\nThe journalist and another colleague, who was attending a dinner in the hotel's\n\nBlue Boar Smokehouse restaurant with the prime minister's former civil service\n\npress secretary Steve Field, had a brief conversation with Feldman about the\n\nvote. Field and two other journalists did not hear the conversation.\n\n\n\nFeldman has said he is consulting his lawyers over the publication of the\n\ncomments, which he said do not \"represent my view of our activists\".\n\n\n\nBinley said: \"I would be hurt and surprised if Andrew Feldman said these things.\n\nBut I am in a serious quandary here because I don't believe senior journalists\n\nwould say these things if they didn't have the basis of truth.\n\n\n\n\"That is why it is no good simply saying Andrew Feldman is an honourable man, it\n\nis no good simply saying I'm going to talk to my lawyer about this. I personally\n\n- and the voluntary sector (of the party) - need to know the truth of this\n\nmatter.\"\n\n\n\nDavid Mellor, a former member of John Major's cabinet, said the row highlighted\n\nthe need to have a heavyweight figure as Tory chairman. Feldman is co-chairman\n\nalong with the MP Grant Shapps. Mellor told the Murnaghan Programme on Sky News:\n\n\"I am old enough to remember the days when the Tory party chairman was a serious\n\npolitical figure and chosen because they were a serious political figure.\n\nFeldman is a great friend of the prime minister.\n\n\n\n\"He strenuously denies (the remarks). But, if so, I have to say as a former\n\nlawyer - sue them. Where is the writ? I think we will find the writ will not\n\nappear.\n\n\n\n\"If it was him - as newspapers suggest - then this has been a disaster waiting\n\nto happen because you cannot elevate tennis playing friends to be chairman of\n\nthe Conservative party without there being a political price to pay.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\n116\n\n\n\nNumber of Tory MPs who backed an amendment regretting the absence of an EU\n\nreferendum in the Queen's speech\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years the electorate has overwhelmingly opposed Britain's membership of the\n\nEuropean Union - particularly those who work for a living. Yet while movements\n\nin other countries that are critical of the EU are led by the left, in Britain\n\nthey are dominated by the hard right, and working-class concerns are largely\n\nignored.\n\n\n\nThis is particularly strange when you consider the EU is largely a Tory\n\nneoliberal project. Not only did the Conservative prime minister Edward Heath\n\ntake Britain into the common market in 1973, but Margaret Thatcher campaigned to\n\nstay in it in the 1975 referendum, and was one of the architects of the Single\n\nEuropean Act - which gave us the single market, EU militarisation and eventually\n\nthe struggling euro. John Major rammed through the Maastricht treaty and\n\nembarked on the disastrous privatisation of our railways using EU directives.\n\n\n\nEven now, the majority of David Cameron's Tories will campaign for staying in\n\nthe EU if we do get the referendum the electorate so clearly wants. And most of\n\nthe left seems to be lining up alongside them. My union stood in the last\n\nEuropean elections under the No2EU-Yes to Democracy coalition, which set out to\n\ngive working people a voice and to challenge the politics of the racist British\n\nNational party, yet the BNP received far more media coverage. Today it is Ukip\n\nthat is enjoying the media spotlight. Its rightwing Thatcherite rhetoric is a\n\ngift to a political establishment that seeks to project a narrow agenda of\n\ncontinued EU membership.\n\n\n\nBut the reality is that Ukip supports the EU agenda of privatisation, cuts and\n\nausterity. It opposes the renationalisation of our rail network as much as any\n\nEurocrat. Yet Ukip has filled the political vacuum created when the Labour party\n\nand parts of the trade union movement adopted the position of EU cheerleaders,\n\nbelieving in the myth of \"social Europe\".\n\n\n\nSocial EU legislation, which supposedly leads to better working conditions, has\n\nnot saved one job and is riddled with opt-outs for employers. It is making\n\nzero-hour contracts and agency-working the norm while undermining collective\n\nbargaining and full-time, secure employment. Meanwhile, 10,000 manufacturing\n\njobs in the East Midlands still hang in the balance because EU law demanded that\n\nthe crucial Thameslink contract go to Siemens in Germany rather than Bombardier\n\nin Derby.\n\n\n\nToday, unemployment in the eurozone is at a record 12%. In the countries hit\n\nhardest, youth unemployment tops 60% and the millions of personal tragedies of\n\nlost homes, jobs, pensions and services are testament to the sick joke of\n\n\"social Europe\".\n\n\n\nThe raft of EU treaties are, as Tony Benn once said, nothing more than a\n\ncast-iron manifesto for capitalism that demands the chaos of the complete free\n\nmovement of capital, goods, services and labour. The EU sees the current crisis\n\nas an opportunity to speed up its privatisation drive. Mass unemployment and\n\neconomic decline is a price worth paying for structural adjustment in favour of\n\nmonopoly capitalism.\n\n\n\nIn Britain and across the EU, every public service faces privatisation and\n\nfragmentation. Indeed, the clause in the Health and Social Care Act demanding\n\nprivatisation of every aspect of our NHS was defended by the Lib Dems on the\n\nbasis of EU competition law.\n\n\n\nBut governments do not have to carry out such EU policies: they could carry out\n\nmeasures on behalf of those who elect them. That means having democratic control\n\nover capital flows, our borders and the future of our economy for the benefit of\n\neveryone.\n\n\n\nThe only rational course is to leave the EU so elected governments regain the\n\ndemocratic power to decide matters on behalf of the people they serve.\n\n\n\nBob Crow is general secretary of the RMT\n\n\n\n",

There's really no problem. The MPs just have\n\nto do it because the associations tell them to, and the associations are all\n\nmad, swivel-eyed loons.\"\n\n\n\nDowning Street faced pressure last night because the Tory has been well known to\n\nthe prime minister for many years and is due to play a significant role in the\n\nparty's preparations for the general election. The Times, Daily Telegraph, the\n\nDaily Mirror, who all reported the remarks and who know the identity of the\n\nTory, declined to name the senior member of the prime minister's circle.\n\n\n\nThe publication of the remarks, which were made during the week while the prime\n\nminister was in the US, are particularly embarrassing for Cameron.

But they felt that the\n\ndefence secretary crossed a line when he criticised No 10 for devoting so much\n\nparliamentary time to the issue. This was regarded as a deeply hostile act and\n\nfed suspicions that Hammond is looking to become chancellor in a post- Cameron\n\ngovernment or even to make a play for the Tory leadership.\n\n\n\nBut No 10 has a more immediate crisis after the name of the Tory who criticised\n\nTory activists was running in Westminster circles last night. The senior figure\n\nis expected to be named today.\n\n\n\nDowning Street, which knows the name of the Tory, declined to comment last\n\nnight. But Farage is planning to exploit the embarrassment when the Tory is\n\nnamed.\n\n\n\nThe Ukip leader is planning to say: \"This person is an excellent recruiting\n\nsergeant for Ukip.

Today, when I speak at the\n\nBritish-American Business Council, I'll be laying out the case to re-focus on\n\neconomic growth - both at home and abroad. And the best way to achieve that is\n\nto keep a firm foothold in European trade at the same time as increasing exports\n\nelsewhere in the world.\n\n\n\nJust as the prime minister was trying to do the right thing in Washington -\n\nshowing leadership on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership and\n\nhighlighting the positive value of the EU - back home, that focus was lost.\n\n\n\nThe recent tussle presents an inward-looking picture of British politics to the\n\noutside world. For those in business, it feels like a diversion from what we\n\nshould be doing in Europe: restoring growth through trade deals; and championing\n\nreforms that we want to make all of Europe more competitive. These issues matter\n\nto the public too because their main concerns are about the economy, jobs and\n\nthe cost of living.\n\n\n\nThe demands for a bill to underpin what the PM had already promised don't\n\nactually move the debate forward. David Cameron had already set out his terms\n\nfor a referendum by 2017 on continued membership of a reformed EU. We already\n\nhad clarity over the process - if not the outcome.\n\n\n\nBusiness has to make the nuts-and-bolts case for what our relationship with\n\nEurope should look like. Maintaining our influence over, and our access to, the\n\nsingle market will be central to that. We have to focus on a positive vision of\n\nreform so Europe does less of the things we don't want, and more of the things\n\nwe do: boosting competitiveness and resisting bad policies that work against\n\ngrowth and stability. Let's be clear: being a member of a reformed EU is the\n\nbest way to preserve market access.\n\n\n\nThere are some who say that we could retain access to the single market without\n\nbeing a member of the EU; that the UK could withdraw and have a relationship\n\nmore akin to Norway's or Switzerland's. I'd urge them to really look at the\n\ndetail.\n\n\n\nNorway's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) - being outside the EU\n\nbut part of the single market - means that it still pays the bills and follows\n\nthe rules but has much less influence on EU decision-making than if it had a\n\nseat at the table. As the Norwegian Conservative MP Nikolai Astrup said to my\n\nteam during their recent fact-finding mission to Norway: \"If the UK wants to run\n\nEurope, it needs to be in Europe. If you want to be run by Europe, feel free to\n\njoin us in the EEA.\"\n\n\n\nWhile this works for Norway's economy, the British would never accept such a\n\nrelationship. It removes none of the issues identified as problems by those who\n\nwant to leave the EU. And while Switzerland appears to have greater flexibility\n\nto pick and choose the EU regulations it applies, the 120 or so agreements that\n\ngovern the EU-Swiss relationship took years to negotiate.\n\n\n\nAt a time of great economic challenge, could UK businesses struggling at the\n\nmargins survive without access to our primary market for an unknown period?\n\nSubmitting to rules without the power to influence them is not my idea of\n\nmuch-touted greater sovereignty.\n\n\n\nThe debate over our future relationship with Europe is a worthy and valid one,\n\nbut we must maintain our perspective. What we need now is economic growth and\n\njobs across the European continent. That means putting all hands to the pump to\n\nboost our competitiveness in the international arena and getting some major\n\ntrade deals signed on the dotted line.\n\n\n\nJohn Cridland is director general of the Confederation of British Industry\n\n\n\n",

The review could ultimately mean civil\n\npartnerships are extended to all couples - or scrapped altogether.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron, who is bracing himself for another bumpy week after the\n\n\"rebellion\" over an EU referendum, has issued instructions to ministers to avoid\n\nany pitfalls next week.\n\n\n\nThe government stepped in amid fears that an amendment designed to give straight\n\ncouples the right to civil partnerships, planned by Tim Loughton, the former\n\nchildren's minister, and two other Tory MPs, could disrupt the equal marriage\n\nbill, which is opposed by many Conservatives.\n\n\n\nPeter Tatchell criticised No 10's move.

Now that the time is\n\nright to extend marriage to same-sex couples, it is also right we should\n\nconsider the future of civil partnerships.\n\n\n\n\"There are strong views on both sides of this debate, and we have listened to\n\nthose views. A proper review will allow us to look at the issues in a considered\n\nand thorough way, giving full consideration to implications of any changes.\"\n\n\n\nEarlier this week the culture secretary Maria Miller, resisted calls for civil\n\npartnerships to be extended to heterosexual couples, expressing concern that to\n\ninclude the issue in the legislation would lead to a significant delay in its\n\nimplementation, and could incur considerable costs.\n\n\n\nShe said: \"The equal marriage bill is about extending marriage to same-sex\n\ncouples. Questions have been raised about whether we should also extend civil\n\npartnerships to opposite-sex couples. We are therefore offering the house the\n\nopportunity to have a review of this area, rather than legislating now without\n\nthe required evidence.\"\n\n\n\nMiller, questioned by the joint human rights committee on Tuesday, appeared\n\nclear that extending civil partnerships was not a preferred option. \"We don't\n\nfeel there is either a necessity or a requirement to open up civil partnerships\n\nto heterosexuals because there is no deficit there - there is no lack of an\n\nability to be able to formalise a relationship in a legal way,\" she said then.\n\n\"It is already there for heterosexual couples. It's called marriage.\"\n\n\n\nAsked about people who might not wish to marry because of their beliefs,\n\nincluding those who saw marriage as oppressive to women and born out of a\n\npatriarchal system, she told the committee she did not see why it would oppress\n\nwomen any more than men. \"Having been married for 23 years, I don't feel\n\noppressed myself, but I can understand that people will have different views,\"\n\nshe said.\n\n\n\nMiller had acknowledged that the abolition of civil partnerships would\n\ndiscriminate against same-sex couples who for certain reasons, including\n\nreligion, did not wish to marry.\n\n\n\nAny review would take place after same-sex marriages have had a chance to become\n\nestablished. A period of five years is suggested so the effect of extending\n\nmarriage to same-sex couples can be assessed and the government can ensure it\n\nhas a proper understanding of the implications of various options.\n\n\n\nChurch of England representatives claimed some amendments tabled to the gay\n\nmarriage bill risked opening the door to pagan, humanist and other forms of\n\nmarriage. Sir Tony Baldry, representing the church estate commissioners, said\n\nthe proposal would completely change the legal basis for marriage in England. He\n\nadded that MPs would have to take a view \"as to whether having heterosexual\n\ncivil partnerships is or is not going to enhance the concept of marriage\".\n\n\n\nTatchell said: \"David Cameron and Maria Miller should stop delaying and making\n\nexcuses. They say their support for gay marriage is based on a commitment to\n\nequality, yet they are refusing to support equal civil partnerships for\n\nheterosexual couples.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a militant Conservative Eurosceptic viewpoint, it has been a terrific few\n\ndays. First, a cascade of serving and former ministers say they want out of the\n\nEU. Second, David Cameron dashes to publish a bill committing the UK to an EU\n\nreferendum in 2017. Third, 116 Tory MPs nevertheless vote to regret the absence\n\nof such a bill from the government's programme. Fourth, in the ballot to bring\n\nin a private member's bill this year, one rebel, James Wharton, comes first and\n\nimmediately commits himself to pick up the PM's draft bill. Throw in a couple of\n\nextra bonbons - Nick Clegg's admission that it is now a matter of \"when, not if\"\n\nthere is a referendum and the continued talk of Tory-Ukip pacts at local level\n\nin 2015 - and it is clear that things are going the sceptics' way.\n\n\n\nMany sceptics can barely contain their excitement. They have got Mr Cameron on\n\nthe run; his weakness as a party leader is palpable. Every day the Tory\n\nanti-European cause makes another advance. The anti-European screw on Mr Cameron\n\nseems to be tightening by the day. But there are two very big problems: first,\n\nall this is dangerous for the Tory party; second, it is the wrong course for the\n\ncountry.\n\n\n\nTake, to begin with, Mr Wharton's bill. The bill commits the UK to an in-out EU\n\nreferendum in 2017. But the focus on the bill is misplaced; it exaggerates the\n\nnotice that voters - including those who are tempted by Ukip - take of what\n\nhappens in parliament. It overstates the priority that voters attach to the\n\nEuropean issue rather than the economy, health, education and immigration. So it\n\nprovides a platform for Tory divisions and obsessiveness.\n\n\n\nSecond, the bill is unlikely to become law. A private member's bill has bigger\n\nprocedural hurdles to cross than government bills. It can be talked out. It can\n\nmore easily be blocked by wrecking amendments. It needs to get through the\n\nLords. And without Labour and Liberal Democrat agreement - which is unlikely,\n\neven though Labour has its own party management issues on Europe - there isn't\n\nenough Commons support anyway. Mr Wharton and his backers may end up drawing\n\nattention to little except their own political impotence.\n\n\n\nThird, the failure of Mr Wharton's bill could have the opposite political effect\n\nto the one its supporters intend. Backers hope that a strong Tory campaign on an\n\nEU referendum will staunch the flow of votes to Ukip. But this may misread the\n\nimportance of the EU to Ukip's current appeal, which is based on a range of\n\nother dissatisfactions, too. If so, it may provide a boost to Ukip's protest\n\nvote rather than pricking its bubble.\n\n\n\nIf that happens, then the whole false logic may repeat itself next year. If Ukip\n\nwins the European elections in May 2014, the Tory panic will be greater than\n\nthis year, not smaller. The Wharton bill could be revived - perhaps by the\n\nTories officially, or by another backbencher. But the Commons arithmetic will\n\nnot have changed. And the Eurosceptics may now find themselves erecting a\n\nplatform for defeat in 2015, not victory. Ironically, it is far from impossible\n\nthat the Lib Dems - most hated of all the Eurosceptics' foes - could be the\n\nultimate beneficiary of their obsession.\n\n\n\nIn the end, though, there are two larger reasons why the Wharton bill is\n\nobjectionable, not just in tactical terms but on principle. One is that it is an\n\nabuse of parliamentary democracy to try to bind a future parliament. This is\n\nlegislation as a political pose, not lawmaking. It is reminiscent of New Labour\n\nat its most bankrupt. It is up to us, the voters, what the 2015 parliament looks\n\nlike and what it does; it is not up to this parliament.\n\n\n\nThe other, even more fundamental point, is that this country should be in, not\n\nout, of the EU. By all means have a referendum, as the law requires, if the\n\nterms of the deal change substantially. But that's simply not on the table right\n\nnow. All our parties, including the Tories, would be much better occupied trying\n\nto make Europe work for the voters, instead of endlessly scheming the collapse\n\nof a union that, with all its faults, still remains central to the long-term UK\n\nnational interest.\n\n\n\n",

Downing Street said Tory MPs would be instructed by their\n\nwhips to vote for the bill.\n\n\n\nWharton's bill will receive its first reading in the Commons on 19 June. The\n\nfirst slot for a private member's bill debate in the Commons is 5 July and\n\nWharton has said he has already been in discussions with government whips to\n\ntake up the bill prepared by his party earlier this week.\n\n\n\nThe move follows a show of strength by Tory Eurosceptics on Wednesday in a vote\n\non an amendment on the Queen's speech that regretted the absence of an in-out EU\n\nreferendum bill in the legislative programme. Dissenting Conservative MPs\n\nnumbered 114, although Cameron's aides insisted the vote was not a blow to his\n\nauthority because he had allowed a free vote and was relaxed about the outcome.\n\n\n\nThe developments have caused consternation in Europe, with the German\n\nchancellor, Angela Merkel, saying she would appeal to Britain to stay in the EU.\n\nMerkel told Germany's WDR television in Berlin that she views the UK as an\n\n\"important member of the EU\" and will lobby \"our British friends to stay in the\n\nbloc\".\n\n\n\nShe said she saw the forthcoming debate in the UK parliament \"as being about\n\nprocedural questions right now. For my part, I will tell my British friends\n\nagain and again that it's good for you and it's good for us (if the UK stays in\n\nthe EU).\"\n\n\n\nCridland took the unusual step of speaking publicly on an issue that divides the\n\nCBI, saying: \"The recent tussle presents an inward-looking picture of British\n\npolitics to the outside. For those in the business world, it feels like a\n\ndiversion from what we should be doing in Europe which is restoring growth,\n\nthrough trade deals, and championing the reforms that we want to make all of\n\nEurope more competitive.\"\n\n\n\nHe added: \"Let's be clear. Being a member of a reformed EU is the best way to\n\npreserve market access.\"\n\n\n\nThe CBI leader rejected claims that Britain could leave the EU but keep some of\n\nthe benefits of membership. \"There are some who say that we could retain access\n\nto the single market without being a member of the EU; that the UK could\n\nwithdraw and have a relationship with the EU more akin to Norway's or\n\nSwitzerland's. I'd urge them to really look at the detail.\"\n\n\n\nCridland said Britain would never accept Norway's status as a member of the\n\nEuropean Economic Area but not part of the EU. That meant Norway \"still pays the\n\nbills and follows the rules but has much lower influence on EU decision-making\n\nthan if it had a seat at the table\".\n\n\n\nThe shadow leader of the house, Angela Eagle, said the Tories had \"descended\n\ninto chaos on Europe, and the bill was 'entirely spurious' and did not include a\n\nimplementation clause or money resolution\".\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Democrats' deputy leader, Simon Hughes, accused the Tories of\n\n\"obsessing about Europe\".\n\n\n\n",

They said the Merkel government wanted\n\nto do whatever it could to help Britain in what was described as taking the\n\nright decision and avoiding a disastrous move.\n\n\n\nA British exit from the EU would send fateful signals around the world, in the\n\nUS and the far east, of an inward-looking Europe mired in fragmentation,\n\nprovincialism and bickering.\n\n\n\nWhile Merkel and senior cabinet members such asWolfgang Schauble, the finance\n\nminister, favour renegotiating the Lisbon treaty to push through political and\n\neconomic policy shifts in the eurozone, Berlin acknowledges this is a tall order\n\nbecause of the resistance in many other countries, mainly but not only France.\n\n\n\nCameron argues the single currency crisis has changed the EU, and is\n\ntransforming the eurozone into a much more integrated core Europe, changing\n\nBritain's status, and wants the treaty renegotiated to reflect this fundamental\n\nshift. But senior officials in Brussels warn that any moves to substantially\n\nrewrite the Lisbon treaty would trigger a referendum domino effect, with not\n\nonly Britain, but Ireland, parts of Scandinavia, perhaps the Netherlands and\n\nthen France needing to stage referendums on a new deal.\n\n\n\nThe leading government figures in Berlin acknowledged that Hollande was\n\nopposed.The treaty changes would inevitably entail transfers of fiscal and\n\neconomic policymaking powers to Brussels, something Paris opposes, then possibly\n\na national vote on the new deal in an increasingly Eurosceptic country,\n\naccording to opinion polls. Hollande played a prominent role in the yes campaign\n\nfor the French referendum on an EU constitution in 2005 and lost. A repeat of\n\nthe failure could cost him his office.\n\n\n\nThe differences between Berlin and Paris are reinforcing their estrangement,\n\nwith no improvement expected until the dust settles after the German elections\n\nin September. Berlin is also worried that France, Italy, and Spain are stuck in\n\na vicious downward cycle of growing unemployment, austerity, and relative lack\n\nof meaningful reform. Berlin is prepared to give France and Spain an extra two\n\nyears to reach budget deficit targets under the euro rulebook, but is insisting\n\nthat the two years not be wasted in policy paralysis.\n\n\n\nWhile the Germans are not making explicit linkage between easing the deficit\n\ntargets and launching reform programmes, they are also warning that they are\n\nprepared to help struggling countries but only on condition that the time is use\n\nproperly to tackle what it identifies as the underlying problems. The issues are\n\ncertain to be raised at two EU summits soon, one next week, the other next\n\nmonth.\n\n\n\nWhile senior government figures are wary of hectoring Paris, there is a sense of\n\nexasperation in Berlin with Paris, that \"something has to happen\", that the\n\nproblems are well-known, but that Hollande is failing to deliver.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nAngela Merkel's government sees Britain as a key ally in its battle for\n\nstructural reform - and a return to economic growth\n\n\n\nBerlin wants to relax budget targets for Spain, where cuts have led to mass\n\nprotests, but only in return for reform\n\n\n\n",

Remember how\n\nMargaret Thatcher came to believe that abroad was more important than at home?\n\nDidn't do her much good. (Cameron will now miss two more prime minister's\n\nquestions, owing to another lavish holiday that starts next week.)\n\n\n\nBack at home, the parties were lining up, or rather milling about. We are\n\nsupposed to have a confrontational chamber; many Europeans have a semi-circle\n\ndesigned for all shades of opinion.\n\n\n\nNow at Westminster we have a mosh pit, with headbangers dancing, whirling at\n\nrandom and bashing each other with their elbows. The Tory party is like a rugby\n\nunion match in which all 30 players are wearing the same strip. They're not sure\n\nwho they are grabbing round the knees, but they're having a lot of fun doing it.\n\n\n\nI have tried to work out a handy guide for readers. The Conservative party is in\n\nthree groups: firstly, the ones who want us out of Europe tomorrow. Some very\n\nstrange people there. If the late Charles Addams designed a political sect, it\n\nwould look like this lot, with Peter Bone as the sinister butler.\n\n\n\nFor example, John Baron, a leader of the moshers, declared yesterday that \"we as\n\na party are more united than ever before on this issue\".\n\n\n\nThen there are the ones who are vaguely anti-Europe but will make up their minds\n\nwhen David Cameron gets the changes he demands. These may include abolition of\n\nthe Common Agricultural Policy (yeah, right) or possibly the EU postponing its\n\nrequirement for straight cucumbers.\n\n\n\nAnd then there are the pro-Europeans, spiritual leader Ken Clarke. David Cameron\n\nmight be in either of the two latter groups, but we don't know because he isn't\n\nhere to tell us.\n\n\n\nLabour. On the whole pro-Europe. Their position is clear: they are in favour of\n\nan in-out referendum, perhaps, and not now, because we don't know what reforms\n\nmight come along, but not later either because it would lead to \"uncertainty\".\n\nIn other words, they might be in favour, and they might not. Let's face it; it's\n\nnone of our business.\n\n\n\nUkip. They don't have any MPs, but are now the third party in most polls. Their\n\nleader is charismatic piss-artist Nigel Farage, who wants an inn-out referendum.\n\nOr any kind of pub. Rarely has anyone with so little power wielded so much\n\ninfluence.\n\n\n\nThe Lib Dems. Now regarded as an annoying irrelevance, as demonstrated when\n\ntheir leader Nick Clegg had to take prime minister's questions yesterday. He\n\ncould barely make himself heard against a barrage of booing and jeering from the\n\nLabour benches, and sneering from the Tories sitting behind him.\n\n\n\nHe used to want an in-out referendum, until he joined in coalition with Cameron,\n\nwho does want an in-out referendum, so he changed his mind. Tory mosher Edward\n\nLeigh mentioned the Lib-Dem manifesto calling for said in-out referendum with\n\nthe Cleggster on the cover. \"Was he an imposter, or just a hypocrite?\"\n\n\n\nI hope I have cleared that all up. I am off to lie down in a dark room.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nTory Eurosceptics put on their biggest show of strength last night, rejecting\n\npleas to show trust in the prime minister, when 114 Conservative MPs voted to\n\nregret the absence of an in-out referendum bill in the Queen's speech.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron's aides insisted the vote was not a blow to his authority, as he\n\nhad given his backbenchers a free vote, but Cameron loyalists had pleaded with\n\nbackbenchers to relent and trust the prime minister after he tried to placate\n\nthem by rushing out a draft Conservative referendum bill.\n\n\n\nCameron has spent much of a three-day visit to the US battling to douse the\n\nEurosceptic fires caused by the rise of Ukip.\n\n\n\nBefore the vote, he maintained that he was extremely relaxed about how\n\nbackbenchers voted and said nothing should be read into the outcome. But the\n\nprevious largest Conservative show of sceptic strength had been in October 2011,\n\nwhen 81 MPs voted for a referendum.\n\n\n\nTory whips said they had not put any pressure on backbenchers, but many senior\n\nfigures had taken to the airwaves urging restraint and trust in Cameron.\n\n\n\nJohn Barron, the leader of the Tory dissidents said: \"We are going to keep at\n\nthis. There is deep distrust out there. Legislation is more realistic than a\n\nmanifesto promise.\"\n\n\n\nThe vote calling for regret over the Queen's speech was defeated by 277 to 130,\n\nincluding 11 Labour MPs and one Liberal Democrat.\n\n\n\nDouglas Carswell, a leading sceptic, said the Tories would now unite behind a\n\nprivate members' bill offering a referendum, adding that it could become law.\n\n\n\nThe result of a ballot for private member's bills will be announced today.\n\nProbably only the top seven MPs in the ballot have a chance of their bill being\n\ndebated and becoming law, but William Hague, the foreign secretary, promised\n\nfull Conservative support for the bill at a tough meeting of the backbench 22\n\ncommittee.\n\n\n\nCarswell said: \"We have to realise we are no longer engaged in trench warfare,\n\nand fight a new much more mobile and flexible campaign. The Tory party has to\n\nrealise that Cameron is no longer the roadblock to a referendum, that it is Nick\n\nClegg, and even he is already beginning to shift under pressure.\"\n\n\n\nCarswell was referring to an earlier admission by the deputy prime minister\n\nyesterday that it was a matter of \"when, rather than if\", a referendum would be\n\nheld. At prime minister's questions, Clegg said: \"Just two years ago, an\n\nabsolute legal guarantee was given in legislation for the first time ever that\n\nwhen the (EU) rules change, there will be a referendum. I think it is a question\n\nof when, not if, because the rules are bound to change.\"\n\n\n\nIt is the most definitive Clegg has been that a referendum will be required\n\nowing to forthcoming EU reforms, and leaves\n\n\n\nEd Miliband the only leader saying that a referendum is not inevitable.\n\n\n\nThe shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, said a commitment to a referendum now would be\n\na massive gamble and a diversion from the economic crisis.\n\n\n\nBut Clegg said his party would not let the Conservatives give government time to\n\na private member's bill. He said: \"The Conservative party are perfectly free for\n\ntheir own reasons to move the goalposts.\" But he added: \"Legislation is already\n\nin place, and the people of Britain have a guarantee about when a referendum\n\nwill take place.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister said his three-pronged approach - reform, renegotiation, and\n\nthen a referendum by the end of 2017 - was right for Britain. He contrasted this\n\nwith Labour and the Liberal Democrats.\n\n\n\n\"You have a very clear policy from the Conservatives. The focus should be on the\n\nother parties. Well, what is your position? Are you going to trust the British\n\npeople and allow them to have a say? We have a very very clear, popular, right\n\nposition that is in the national interest and the other parties have now got to\n\nmake their minds up.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest Tory rebellion over Europe is like an iceberg, which is why David\n\nCameron has had to change course in the face of it and promise to bring forward\n\nan EU referendum bill. What the prime minister can see - 70 backbenchers\n\nthreatening to vote against the Queen's speech - is only a fraction of the\n\nobstacle. Hidden beneath the surface are more substantial opponents and wider\n\ncauses of resentment.\n\n\n\nQuite why this has turned into a potential shipwreck for the prime minister is\n\nan intriguing question. After all, if you don't have a plan for dealing with\n\nEurope rebellions you really should not be in Cameron's position. The leader of\n\nthe Conservatives has to be able to handle an eruption of Euroscepticism as\n\nsurely as the All England Club has to decide whether to close the Wimbledon roof\n\nduring a shower. It's no good saying, \"Who would have thought it, eh, rain in\n\nsummer?\"\n\n\n\nYou simply cannot stop the Tories banging on about Europe, and certainly not by\n\npromising a referendum at some point, if a renegotiation of some kind does not\n\ndeliver something or other.\n\n\n\nNo 10 was blindsided by the strategy of tacking this rebellion on to the Queen's\n\nspeech, a cleverer move than anything it was expecting. But Cameron ought to\n\nhave suspected that the rebel masterminds were far more experienced than the\n\nnovice backbenchers putting their heads above the parapet. The suspicion must\n\nsurely be that ministers, former ministers, veteran Tories and leadership\n\ncontenders are working away behind the scenes. If Gavin Barwell, parliamentary\n\naide to Michael Gove, is ready to vote against the government on Europe, then\n\nhow long would it be before Gove, who has hinted at his sympathy for the rebels,\n\nfollowed suit?\n\n\n\nCameron should have wondered too why David Davis threw a champagne bash for\n\nNadine Dorries this week to celebrate her return to the Tory fold after being\n\nsuspended for insubordination - and why anyone dared to go.\n\n\n\nThe reason MPs stick two fingers up in this way is deep anger in the party at\n\nCameron's leadership, which goes beyond Europe. It is visceral enough to prompt\n\n14 MPs to write secretly to the chairman of the 1922 committee of backbenchers\n\nto demand a leadership vote. To draw parallels with the early 1990s is not\n\nhysterical: John Major faced the crippling Maastricht rebellion during an\n\neconomic crisis when he had a wafer-thin majority.\n\n\n\nJust as a compromised Major felt cornered by the ministers he called \"bastards\",\n\nCameron is being pressured by Gove and Philip Hammond, the defence secretary,\n\nwho are trying to take a line on Europe that is too hard for him to cope with.\n\nAnd more ministers could break cover to call for withdrawal from the EU at any\n\nmoment. Cameron should have known: he was a government special adviser during\n\nMaastricht.\n\n\n\nCameron is running out of goodwill among rightwingers, and there wasn't much in\n\nthe first place. This is because they too are running out of options. Ukip is\n\nsteaming ahead, borne not just (if at all) by disquiet over Europe but - as Lord\n\nAshcroft's research shows - by concern over economic failures, immigration, law\n\nand order, and a sense that Cameron does not really understand, or even like,\n\nthe sort of middle Britons who want tough policies in these areas. Tory MPs in\n\nmany parts of the country fear this Ukip surge will take their seats.\n\n\n\nThe rebels' next move would have been their own referendum legislation. So\n\nCameron has decided to bring forward draft legislation in a government-backed\n\nprivate member's bill. Plainly there is not enough support in parliament to pass\n\nit, as things stand. The Lib Dems oppose it, and Ed Miliband has still to say\n\nwhat his position is. Tory MPs argue, however, that even if the bill fails, an\n\nearly effort to pilot it will demonstrate backbone to the electorate.\n\n\n\nIn truth, most voters are probably not going to vote on the Europe issue, even\n\nthough the public currently polls slightly in favour of withdrawal. But Tory MPs\n\nbelieve that looking determined about a referendum buys trust. They think\n\nCameron has wobbled too much on too many totemic issues. They need to show they\n\nstand for something.\n\n\n\nAs for the renegotiation, Cameron says he wants a looser relationship based on\n\ntrade. But his MPs have a detailed shopping list of powers - on justice,\n\nemployment, energy and agriculture - that they want brought back.\n\n\n\nAnd so the next iceberg looms.\n\n\n\nMelissa Kite is a contributing editor of the Spectator\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a generation now the Tories have shown a heroic instinct for self-immolation\n\nover Europe. Whatever deal or concession is made, it can be relied on not to\n\nlast. In January, David Cameron was supposed to have shot Ukip's fox and bought\n\noff his restive backbenchers with the promise of an in-out EU referendum by\n\n2017.\n\n\n\nBut a fortnight ago the rightwing anti-Brussels populists took a quarter of the\n\nvote in local elections, and now Downing Street is in disarray as Tory cabinet\n\nministers prepare to abstain on a critical referendum amendment to their\n\ngovernment programme put down by their own backbenchers.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister has rushed to produce a bill to set the referendum commitment\n\nin legal stone - though it stands no chance of being passed. Cameron even had to\n\ncall in support for his negotiate-first-vote-later line from the US president to\n\nshore up his position.\n\n\n\nIn the end it will be Ed Miliband, however, who digs him out of his latest hole.\n\nInstead of abstaining and sending Cameron to humiliating defeat at the hands of\n\nhis own party, Labour MPs have been told to oppose the Tory referendum amendment\n\n- for fear of giving ground to the demand for a popular vote.\n\n\n\nThe Tory backbenchers, who are out for Cameron's scalp, will be back. As two\n\nformer Conservative chancellors have come out in favour of leaving the EU, and\n\ncabinet ministers Michael Gove and Philip Hammond have said they'd vote no if\n\nthere were a referendum now, Tory pressure for withdrawal has gone critical.\n\nIt's the bandwagon for the small-state, anti-immigrant UK Independence party -\n\nrunning at 18% and taking lumps out of the Tory vote - that's made the\n\ndifference, of course.\n\n\n\nA good part of Ukip's bubble is as much a xenophobic expression of powerlessness\n\nand falling living standards as it is of opposition to the EU, which is well\n\ndown most voters' priority lists. In a sense, the rise of a rightwing\n\nnationalist party only brings Britain into line with the continental norm and\n\nhas coincided this month with a drop in support for EU withdrawal from 51% to\n\n43%.\n\n\n\nBut public opinion remains overwhelmingly in favour of a referendum. And, as\n\nelsewhere in Europe, the only reason the political elite continues to resist\n\ngiving people a vote on such a fundamental and changed constitutional\n\nrelationship is because it fears it may not get the right result.\n\n\n\nThat's clearly an unsustainable anti-democratic nonsense, which will poison the\n\npolitical water until it's corrected. Unlike in other parts of Europe, where\n\nopposition to the EU or its policies has straddled the political spectrum, in\n\nBritain it has been dominated since the late 80s by the fake patriots of the\n\nTory right and their cheerleading press. While claiming to champion national and\n\ndemocratic sovereignty against an unaccountable Europe, they're more than happy\n\nto swallow subordination to the United States and the City of London. So if\n\nCameron and the Tories are able to monopolise the campaign to change the EU\n\nrelationship, it's clear what the negotiation will be all about.\n\n\n\nTop of the list will be protection of the financial interests that crashed the\n\nBritish economy, along with the ditching of some of the things most British\n\npeople actually like about the EU, such as working hours and employment\n\nprotection, and guaranteed holidays.\n\n\n\nCameron hopes to claim victory with some retrograde opt-outs and thus back a yes\n\nvote. That would be bad enough, but a successful Tory-led campaign to pull out\n\nof the EU would risk unleashing a carnival of reaction, anti-migrant hysteria,\n\nmore attacks on social rights, and a further lurch to the right.\n\n\n\nWhat has been almost entirely missing from British public debate has been the\n\nprogressive case for fundamental change that has been central to the struggle\n\nover the EU and its treaties in mainland Europe. In the 1975 referendum, the\n\nleft case against the then common market was that it was a cold war customs\n\nunion against the developing world that would block socialist reforms. But the\n\nmodern EU has gone much further, giving a failed neoliberal model of capitalism\n\nthe force of treaty, entrenching deregulation and privatisation and enforcing\n\ncorporate power over employment rights.\n\n\n\nClaims that the single market would boost growth have proved groundless. But the\n\nEU's profoundly undemocratic and dysfunctional structures have been brutally\n\nexposed by the eurozone crisis and the devastation wreaked by Troika-imposed\n\nausterity.\n\n\n\nThe fallout from that crisis means the EU will in any case have to be\n\nrestructured. Given those circumstances and the Tory commitment, it would be\n\nboth wrong in principle and politically foolish for Labour not to back a\n\nreferendum.\n\n\n\nMiliband worries that a referendum would dominate a Labour government's agenda.\n\nBut denying the voters a say would make it less likely Labour would be elected\n\nin the first place. The Labour leader has already argued for \"comprehensive\" EU\n\nreform, including of restrictions on state aid and intervention. In office, he\n\nwould need to go a lot further in using the leverage of restructuring to\n\nnegotiate change, in alliance with others across Europe. But a progressive\n\npackage of demands should also shift the shape of a subsequent referendum.\n\n\n\nWhat would be fatal would be to allow the nationalist right to continue to\n\ndictate the EU agenda and wrap itself in the mantle of democratic legitimacy.\n\nThe terms of debate have to change - for the sake of both Britain and Europe.\n\n\n\nTwitter: @SeumasMilne\n\n\n\n",

The bill states that voters\n\nwould be asked the question, \"Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain\n\na member of the European Union?\"\n\n\n\nAnnouncing he would be prepared to back a private members' bill, the prime\n\nminister - speaking from Boston - denied he was panicked into rushing forward\n\nthe measure. \"Not at all. If this was a Conservative-only government we would\n\njust get on and legislate.\n\n\n\n\"But I have always said that anything we can do to strengthen the pledge . . .\n\nwe should do.\" Cameron insisted it was \"completely wrong\" to suggest that he\n\nchanges tack on Europe to appease his party.\n\n\n\nA senior Tory source said: \"This is our red line.

It is in the national interest to\n\nchange Europe and change the relationship with Europe.\"\n\n\n\nA senior Tory source made clear that No 10 will use the draft bill to step up\n\npressure on Labour and the Lib Dems.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nGrant Shapps, above, accused Clegg of contempt for the view of the people\n\n\n\n",

The January speech in which he\n\ncommitted to renegotiation and referendum pretended to seize the initiative. In\n\ntruth, it was a nervy reaction to a restive backbench and an already evident\n\nbump in Ukip support. Four months on, he has abjectly failed to deal with\n\neither. Ukip is sitting pretty on 18% in the polls, and the parliamentary party\n\nhas entered a condition which one sympathetic observer said yesterday cried out\n\nless for political analysis than for psychiatry.\n\n\n\nEvery frenzied demand to lock down or bring forward the promised plebiscite is\n\nanswered with more panicky political percussion. Days after insisting that\n\ncoalition realities precluded pre-election legislation for a post-election\n\nreferendum, Mr Cameron belatedly signalled a rethink about whether there was\n\nsomething he could do in parliament. But if you seek to satisfy obsessives, it\n\nis as well to be certain that you really can give them all they want. Mr Cameron\n\nwas instead virtually certain that he could not deliver. For, while his Lib Dem\n\npartners have proposed an in/out referendum in the event of a new EU treaty,\n\nthey have no patience with a gratuitous vote. The PM was so resigned to this\n\nthat he did not bother raising a referendum bill with Nick Clegg before the\n\nQueen's speech. After Her Majesty was mute on the subject, the malcontents\n\ninevitably started mumbling afresh.\n\n\n\nIn the vain hope of calming the Conservative mood, Mr Cameron has tirelessly\n\nimprovised. In place of the familiar one-, two- or three-line whip, Tory\n\nbackbenchers will today experience the \"profoundly relaxed\" whip, effectively\n\nlicensing them to criticise their own government's Queen's speech. Ministers\n\nwill meanwhile be shepherded away from the voting lobbies entirely, for fear of\n\ndrawing further attention to the cabinet divisions laid bare at the weekend,\n\nwhen Michael Gove and Philip Hammond let slip that they could happily live with\n\nan immediate EU exit. In another departure, ministerial aides - ordinarily\n\nexpected to vote with their bosses - will enjoy a special free pass. Finally, on\n\nMonday night, No 10 signalled the half-hope that a referendum bill, published by\n\nthe Conservative party rather than Whitehall, might wend its way to the statute\n\nbooks after being picked up by some backbencher.\n\n\n\nThe procedural obstacles are profound, and Mr Cameron's real aim is less\n\nachieving anything concrete than chiding Labour and Lib Dem MPs into voting\n\nagainst giving the people a say. That is never a popular position to take, and\n\nit is only because of Ed Miliband's steely concern to prevent his potential\n\npremiership becoming as ensnared in Europe as the Cameron administration that\n\nLabour has thus far held its nerve against the in/out vote. The Tory tactics\n\nmight appear sharp, but they do not add up to a strategy for the government -\n\nstill less the country. Most voters certainly would quite like a referendum, but\n\nnot at the price of a divided government, paralysed on things that matter more.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron started the week petitioning Barack Obama for an EU-US trade deal,\n\nsomething he understandably regards as important - greater trade is one of the\n\nfew forms of stimulus compatible with his economic ideology. But there is no UK\n\ntrade policy other than that operated through the EU. The US president's gentle\n\nwords about the importance of getting the relationship between Britain and the\n\nEU right could not disguise the farce of a prime minister lobbying on behalf of\n\na club which some of his own ministers openly wish to quit. Exasperation in\n\nBrussels underlines the diplomatic price that Britain will pay. Mr Cameron once\n\nled his party by challenging it, but today he meekly muddles through by\n\npandering to its obsessions. Weakness rather than argument provoked the change\n\nof course, for the younger Cameron's critique of the Tories' Euro-obsession\n\nremains bang-on.\n\n\n\n",

Big\n\nbusiness and the City, the latter now largely owned by US investment banks which\n\nview the UK as an important bridgehead into Europe, clearly want to retain\n\naccess to the single market - but without the employment, health and safety and\n\nwelfare protections negotiated by the labour movement. This suggests that much\n\nof the Tory dissension is disingenuous posturing, designed to negotiate\n\nrepatriation of powers in these areas and take the sting out of the Ukip threat,\n\nor represents \"Little Englander\" attempts to replace control of our economy by\n\ninternational monopoly capital with that of British monopoly capital.\n\n\n\nBut this shouldn't obscure the progressive argument for leaving the EU. The EU\n\nstability and growth pact outlaws Keynesian-style reflationary policies.\n\nCompetition policy prevents state aid to strategic industries. The EU services\n\ndirective forces privatisation of what remains of the public sector. And\n\nEuropean court of justice rulings undermine collective bargaining and wage\n\nlevels. Social Europe is a con. The left needs to make the case for an\n\nalternative, progressive future outside the EU - where we have the right to\n\nself-determination, can rebalance the economy away from finance towards\n\nmanufacturing and can construct a society on democratic, socialist terms.\n\n\n\nChris Guiton\n\n\n\nCrowborough, East Sussex\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron's clamour to open the EU treaties to get a new deal for Britain in\n\nEurope could trigger a whole stream of risky national votes, senior EU officials\n\nsaid yesterday amid exasperation with the prime minister's concession to Tory\n\nbackbenchers on the referendum bill.\n\n\n\nEuropean leaders declined to say anything publicly about the Conservative\n\nparty's draft bill on an in-out EU referendum. It is being interpreted in\n\nBrussels as internal Tory party politicking, but privately there is acute and\n\nincreasing frustration with Cameron's tactics.\n\n\n\nThey complained that while in Washington Cameron launched another round of\n\nBrussels-bashing when he was supposed to be promoting the merits of a potential\n\ngamechanging trade pact between the EU and the US.\n\n\n\n\"It's the frustration, even on things like this when it would be better to talk\n\nup the EU. You would actually have thought this was just a US-UK trade pact,\"\n\nsaid one official.\n\n\n\n\"It's the kind of stuff where you just feel you're banging your head off the\n\nwall.\"\n\n\n\nAnother senior official said: \"It's pure political posturing. Pure ideology.\n\nBritish pragmatism has gone away.\"\n\n\n\nOfficials also pointed to the irony of George Osborne being in Brussels on\n\nTuesday to push strongly for an EU deal to curb tax evasion even while the talk\n\nin his party ranks was about quitting the EU.\n\n\n\nThe jury is out on whether Cameron will win his fight to get a fiendishly\n\ncomplicated renegotiation of the Lisbon treaty, with the aim of securing new\n\nBritish terms of EU membership that would then be put to a referendum in 2017 if\n\nCameron wins a second term in 2015.\n\n\n\nThe big political changes being made in the eurozone as a result of the currency\n\ncrisis would warrant a renegotiation, Brussels concedes. But there are major\n\npolitical obstacles in the member states militating against reopening the\n\ntreaty.\n\n\n\nEven before a vote on a new settlement in Britain, a revised Lisbon treaty would\n\ncertainly trigger referendum calls in Ireland or Denmark.\n\n\n\n\"Then you have the domino effect. What about the Netherlands, Sweden, France.\n\n(President Francois) Hollande's position is key. He needs a referendum like a\n\nhole in the head,\" said one of the officials.\n\n\n\nOpinion polls show a pattern of collapsing support for the EU in France while\n\nHollande's ratings are at historical lows for a French president. Hollande was\n\ntraumatised by France's rejection of an EU constitution in 2005 and would seek\n\nto avoid any such repetition.\n\n\n\n\"There will be huge pressure for referendums,\" said one of the senior sources.\n\n\"But politicians are unlikely to start on the road to referendums if they think\n\nthey will lose them.\"\n\n\n\nThere is also exasperation in EU capitals that Cameron has declined, as yet, to\n\nflesh out what kind of changes he wants or which policy areas he hopes to\n\nrenegotiate.\n\n\n\nThe puzzlement extends to British officials and business. A delegation from the\n\nConfederation of British Industry was in Brussels and sounded out the European\n\ncommission about what Downing Street wanted because they have not been told.\n\n\n\nSimilar puzzlement surrounds the battery of EU police, justice, and security\n\nmeasures that Britain needs to renegotiate, a policy recently severely\n\ncriticised by a House of Lords inquiry as damaging the British national\n\ninterest.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nOfficials noted the irony of George Osborne's Brussels visit to push for an EU\n\ntax deal while his party is split on EU membership\n\n\n\n",

These include ending extreme\n\npoverty and hunger by 2030.\n\n\n\nOn the final leg of his three-day trip to the US, the prime minister arrived in\n\nNew York yesterday for the last meetings of the panel that is due to report to\n\nthe UN secretary general by the end of the month on the successors to the MDGs.\n\n\n\nThe trip has inevitably been overshadowed by the furore back at Westminster over\n\na possible EU referendum.\n\n\n\nCameron stopped off on his way to the UN to appear on a new Routemaster\n\ndoubledecker bus with Prince Harry as part of the Great campaign that promotes\n\nBritish culture and industry around the world.\n\n\n\nHe then headed to the UN, where members of the high-level panel are facing\n\nstrong pressure from aid agencies to place a clear commitment to reduce income\n\ninequality in the report. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, one of\n\nCameron's co-chairs, has been lobbied strongly to include the plan, which would\n\ncommit developed countries to meet targets to reduce income inequality.\n\n\n\nDowning Street believes this is a mistaken approach and says the focus should\n\ninstead be on agreeing 10 goals, to be achieved by 2030, which it regards as the\n\n\"building blocks\" to tackle poverty in the developing world. The goals are:\n\nending extreme poverty, ending hunger, ensuring the provision of safe and\n\nsustainable water supplies, stopping preventable deaths, ensuring a school place\n\nfor every girl and boy, empowering girls and women, delivering infrastructure\n\nand energy, boosting jobs, ensuring access to justice and ensuring effective and\n\nopen government.\n\n\n\nA No 10 source said: \"The prime minister wants to keep the focus on measurable\n\nconcrete actions that would help you to alleviate poverty and keep the focus on\n\nbeing something people could judge whether or not we are delivering.\n\n\n\n\"Obviously we want to be lifting up the world's poorest. But the best way to do\n\nthat is to have more specific actions rather than some overarching high level\n\nmessage. We should not be seeking to create perverse incentives that would bring\n\npeople downwards rather than lifting people up.\"\n\n\n\nDowning Street says the prime minister is happy with the way the panel report is\n\nproceeding. But as he arrived in the US, Cameron indicated that he needed to\n\nmaintain pressure when he said: \"I need to be there in order to nail down some\n\nsimple, clear commitments that everyone can get behind as we look to the\n\nsuccessors to the millennium development goals.\"\n\n\n\nCameron's talks at the White House this week focused in part on the G8 summit he\n\nis to host in Northern Ireland next month.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister will today announce that Britain is to use its G8 presidency\n\nto agree a new international approach on dementia, which affects 35.6 million\n\npeople in the world. The World Health Organisation estimates this will nearly\n\ndouble every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050.\n\n\n\nBritain will host a G8 dementia summit in London in September, while Britain and\n\nthe US are to work together to improve research into the condition. \"Dementia is\n\na devastating disease - not just for sufferers but for their families and\n\nfriends too. And as more people live longer, it is fast becoming one of the\n\nbiggest social and healthcare challenges we face,\" Cameron said.\n\n\n\n\"Families, communities, health systems and their budgets will increasingly be\n\nstrained as the number affected increases and so we need to do all we can to\n\nimprove how we research, diagnose and treat the disease. That's why we're using\n\nour G8 to bring together health ministers, clinical researchers and healthcare\n\ncompanies.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister's trip to the US has been overshadowed in large part by the\n\nTory rebellion over Europe back home. Downing Street was irritated when Michael\n\nGove bolstered Eurosceptics on Sunday, the day of Cameron's departure for the\n\nUS, by saying he would vote to leave the EU if a referendum were held now. But\n\nNo 10 was delighted when Barack Obama said it would be wrong to leave the EU\n\nbefore the prime minister has embarked on his renegotiation of Britain's\n\nmembership terms. The president told Cameron he was planning to say something on\n\nEurope - if asked - and ran his comments past the prime minister.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a reception at the Milk photographic studios, the prime minister\n\nhailed the close economic partnership between Britain and the US, though he\n\njoked that the UK falls behind in one controversial area. Saying that Britain\n\nand the US will be beaten in the \"global race\" on low wages and other areas and\n\nreferring to the shale gas fracking industry in the US, he said: \"We are not\n\ngoing to be able to compete on our mineral resources, although frankly I am\n\npretty jealous of your fracking success here in the US.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nA new London Routemaster bus carrying Prince Harry and David Cameron arrives on\n\na promotional visit to New York Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n",

For all three established parties to be falling back in the polls at the\n\nsame time is unprecedented in the 29-year history of the Guardian/ICM series.\n\nThe Tories are plumbing depths they have not experienced in more than a decade.\n\n\n\nThe Conservatives had previously promised to publish an EU referendum bill. But\n\nyesterday on Cameron's visit to Washington, and in an attempt to respond to\n\ngrowing backbench clamour, Downing Street said that the prime minister was\n\nprepared to offer formal Tory backing for a private member's bill that would\n\nguarantee a referendum.\n\n\n\nA draft referendum bill will be published this morning and Number 10 indicated\n\nthat the prime minister would try to get it debated in parliament by allowing a\n\nbackbencher to table it. A government parliamentary bill cannot be introduced in\n\nthe face of Lib Dem opposition. But a private member's bill will often fail for\n\nlack of time as in practice it is relatively easy for a small group of\n\nbackbenchers to use parliamentary procedure to talk it out.\n\n\n\nA senior Tory spokesman said last night: \"The prime minister has said he wants\n\nto explore ways in which he can make sure that (referendum) commitment is\n\nstrengthened. So tomorrow the Conservative party will publish a draft bill to\n\nlegislate for an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. We will examine all\n\nopportunities to bring this bill before parliament, including as a private\n\nmember's bill.\"\n\n\n\nEarlier yesterday Cameron - in danger of looking as weak as John Major at the\n\nheight of the Maastricht crisis - took comfort from the broad endorsement of his\n\nEuropean strategy by Barack Obama at a joint White House Press conference.\n\n\n\nThe US president first described Britain's EU membership as an \"expression of\n\nits influence\" around the world, but then offered measured praise for the prime\n\nminister's plan to renegotiate Britain's EU membership terms after the next\n\nelection. He said: \"You probably want to see if you can fix what is broken in a\n\nvery important relationship before you break it off - that makes some sense to\n\nme.\"\n\n\n\nBut Obama said he would wait to see if the negotiations succeeded before making\n\na final judgment, and repeatedly stressed the need for the UK to be engaged.\n\n\n\nCameron acted after it became clear that as many as 80 Tory MPs had signed an\n\namendment, due to be debated tomorrow, regretting the absence of a referendum\n\nbill in the Queen's Speech. In an admission of weakness Tory whips agreed that\n\nparliamentary private secretaries, the lowest rung of the government ladder,\n\nwould have a free vote. Ministers have been told they must abstain or vote\n\nagainst.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian/ICM poll is remarkable because barring a single month in 2002, the\n\nConservatives have not dropped below 28% since Tony Blair's long honeymoon in\n\n1997-98.\n\n\n\nThe Lib Dems have not fallen below today's 11% in the series since September of\n\n1997, the immediate aftermath of Blair's first victory.\n\n\n\nLabour's 34% score is its lowest since the immediate aftermath of Gordon Brown's\n\nejection from power, in July 2010.\n\n\n\nThe poll also shows that there is a clear \"Farage factor\" in the personal\n\nleadership ratings. Last month voters were split down the middle on his\n\nperformance with 28% saying Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, was doing a good job,\n\nand 29% a bad job, giving a net negative score of -1. Today, the balance of\n\nopinion is running 40%:23% in his favour, a net positive of +17.\n\n\n\nLast night Farage described the Conservative proposal as \"a sticking plaster to\n\npaste the cracks of a divided party.\"\n\n\n\nA senior Lib Dem source told the Press Association that the party was\n\n\"nonplussed\" about news of the bill and that the issue of legislation on a\n\nreferendum was not discussed during negotiations on the Queen's Speech.\n\n\n\nDouglas Alexander, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, described it as \"the\n\nlatest panicked response from the Prime Minister who is now following, rather\n\nthan leading his backbenchers\".\n\n\n\nCameron has been infuriated by cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Philip Hammond\n\nsaying on Sunday they would leave the EU if there was a referendum now. \"There\n\nisn't going to be a referendum tomorrow so it is a hypothetical question,\"\n\nCameron said yesterday. He accused those predicting he will secure only\n\ninconsequential concessions from Brussels of \"throwing in the towel\".\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nThe three main parties are down four points in the latest Guardian/ICM poll,\n\nwith Ukip picking up nine points to reach 18%\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Sharif clan back in office in Pakistan and the Castros hanging on in\n\nCuba it seemed appropriate yesterday that one of Britain's own landed dynasties\n\nshould make a statesman's tilt at a great issue of our time. Up to history's\n\nchallenge stepped Nicholas Soames, through whose veins course the blood and\n\nbrandy of his grandfather and wartime prime minister.\n\n\n\nAdmittedly Soames had decided to make his Churchillian oration during the NHS\n\nstage of the annual debate on the Queen's Speech and to do so on the topical but\n\ntenuously connected subject of Europe. But when destiny calls a Churchill the\n\nsummons must be answered immediately, accompanied by a whisky and soda. In\n\ntaking on the baying ranks of his own party Soames answered the call as grandpa\n\nso often did (sometimes wisely).\n\n\n\nUp to that point the debate had been dire. The NHS's new cheerleader, Jeremy\n\nHunt, made a complacent speech on the service's \"heroic\" performance in tough\n\ntimes, as incumbent health secretaries must. Then Labour's Andy Burnham warned\n\nhow the arteries of our once-thriving hospitals are being clogged up by Tory\n\npolicies, as ex-health secretaries usually do. Between the pair of them and\n\neager supporters they blamed each other.\n\n\n\nBut Europe kept barging its way into the conversation like a drunk in a pub.\n\nLabour's Frank Dobson complained that the Tories have opened the NHS to\n\npredatory US health firms via EU contract law, Thatcherite Tory Edward Leigh\n\nasked Burnham if he would grant the British people a referendum on Europe. \"Mad\n\nobsessives,\" was the drift of Burnham's reply. What about the NHS?\n\n\n\nSo Soames's magisterial intervention came like a burst of Chopin's First Ballade\n\n(Opus 23) during Britain's Got Talent, a tiger stalking the Battersea Dogs Home,\n\nan Eiger dumped on the gentle North Downs above his Mid-Sussex constituency. He\n\neven boomed in the unapologetically posh way Etonians used to speak before rough\n\ntrade like the Camerons were admitted and Estuary English became a GCSE subject.\n\n\n\nThe thrust of Soames's pro-European remarks was that young Cameron had made a\n\npromise and that should be enough. His stated EU policy should certainly not be\n\nchallenged by the \"prejudice or pub rhetoric\"of some Tory MPs - no names - or\n\ntheir \"hysterical, knee-jerk, publicity-seeking acts.\" He spoke of trust and the\n\nintegrity of government, of a momentous decision affecting generations unborn.\n\n\n\nIt was magnificent stuff and, like many of grandpa's speeches in his wilderness\n\nyears (1931-39), was received with thinly-populated indifference and a solitary\n\n\"hear,hear.\" NHS buffs are immune to appeals to history further back than 1948\n\nand Eurosceptics cherish the conceit that grandpa would have been on their side,\n\nalong with Nigel Farage: for brandy and cigar, read pints.\n\n\n\nBut Soames's speech certainly raised the dreary tone.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish prime ministers are advised to show a little humility when the US\n\npresident receives them in the East Room of the White House.\n\n\n\nHanging on the wall is the Lansdowne portrait of 1797, depicting George\n\nWashington, which was rescued during the burning of Washington in 1814 when\n\nBritish troops set fire to public buildings throughout the city.\n\n\n\nStill, despite the reminder of a not always easy relationship, Obama hailed\n\nCameron as his \"friend and partner\" at the start of a joint press conference\n\nafter an hour of talks in the Oval Office. Obama's gushing language was in the\n\nfamiliar tradition of recent US presidents who score an easy hit with visiting\n\nBritish prime ministers by lavishing them with praise and hailing the\n\nAnglo-American special relationship.\n\n\n\nBut this time Obama went further and offered Cameron some useful cover as he\n\ntries to fight growing pressure in the Conservative party to hold an immediate\n\nin/out referendum on Britain's EU membership.\n\n\n\nIn a rare intervention in the internal workings of an allied country, Obama\n\nsaid: \"You probably want to see if you can fix what is broken in a very\n\nimportant relationship before you break it off. It makes some sense to me.\"\n\n\n\nThe president's carefully scripted remarks produced paroxysms of excitement\n\namong aides with the prime minister. \"Most powerful man on earth supports PM's\n\nposition,\" one said.\n\n\n\nObama's intervention on such a touchstone issue for Cameron shows how the prime\n\nminister has succeeded in forging a relationship that goes beyond the usual\n\npleasantries. The president, whose respect for Cameron grew when he took such a\n\nstrong stance on Libya, is now prepared to go out on a limb and help his \"friend\n\nand partner\" when he faces pressure back home. But Obama indicated that his\n\nsupport would not be unconditional, as he gave a gentle hint of US unease about\n\nthe prime minister's plans to renegotiate Britain's EU membership terms if he\n\nwins the 2015 general election.\n\n\n\nThe president said he would wait to see the outcome of the negotiations before\n\ngiving a judgment. Obama even suggested the negotiations may not be successful\n\nwhen he said he \"would be interested in seeing whether or not those are\n\nsuccessful before rendering a final judgment\".\n\n\n\nThe nuanced messages from Obama on the EU show the president thinks the pressure\n\non Cameron is palpably wrongheaded and should be resisted. But his clarion call\n\nfor Britain to remain in the EU - as a way of strengthening both British and US\n\ninterests - shows that Obama believes a battle lies ahead of potentially global\n\nsignificance.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister greeted the support from Obama with good grace as he saw the\n\npresident deprive some eurosceptics of a vital weapon in their armoury - that\n\nBritain should choose the US over the EU.\n\n\n\nBut he was not afraid to voice his unease over a failure to act on Syria as he\n\nannounced an extra Â£10m to fund non-lethal weaponry to the Syrian opposition.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nReaching out\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron and Barack Obama at the White House press conference yesterday,\n\nwhere the president made a rare foray into Britain's internal politics\n\nPhotograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the hunt for historical precedents for Ukip's breakthrough today, three full\n\ndecades of Guardian/ICM polling disappoint. The Green party briefly registered\n\n8% in July 1989, after performing spectacularly well in the European elections\n\nof the same year, but that is less than half the 18% achieved by the surging\n\nfourth party which has leaped into third place.\n\n\n\nTo find a sharper disruption to the settled pattern of polling it is necessary\n\nto go back to the creation of the SDP in 1981. Gallup briefly recorded that\n\nparty's new alliance with the Liberals hitting a startling 50%.\n\n\n\nWhile it is the Conservatives who continue to pay the heaviest price for Ukip's\n\narrival as a major player in national polls, the detailed data confirms that the\n\nLiberal Democrats and latterly Labour are also now seeping serious support. Back\n\nin April, when Ukip were on 9% nationwide, 10% of Tory voters at the 2010\n\nelection had defected to Nigel Farage's party, compared with 2% of 2010 Labour\n\nvoters and 8% of 2010 Lib Dems. The defection has now gathered pace: over a\n\nquarter of Cameron's 2010 backers, 27%, had switched to Ukip by May. Some 13% of\n\n2010 Labour supporters have gone the same way, together with 12% of 2010 Lib\n\nDems.\n\n\n\nFiguring out how Farage's current support would cash in at a general election is\n\nfraught with difficulty, because under Britain's first-past-the-post system\n\neverything depends on where votes are concentrated, and with Ukip having been so\n\nmuch smaller in 2010 past experience offers little guide. Mechanically applying\n\na uniform surge in Ukip support underlines how tough it is for a new party to\n\nbreak through. Using the new ICM figures, the Electoral Calculus model projects\n\nthat the next parliament would end up with 228 Tory seats (down 79), 359 Labour\n\n(up 101, and enough for an overall majority of 68) and 35 for the Lib Dems\n\n(implying 22 losses). In this scenario, Ukip would be left with no seats at all,\n\nits voters left even more under-represented than SDP supporters in 1983 - when\n\nthe Alliance was left with a mere 23 seats from more than a quarter of the vote.\n\n\n\nIn the recent council elections Ukip surprised number-crunchers by picking up as\n\nmany seats as it did by winning where it mattered. But even if it can get better\n\nat concentrating votes through targeted campaigns, it will face an uphill\n\nstruggle to secure more than a handful of MPs.\n\n\n\nFounded exactly 20 years ago, on the single issue of taking Britain out of the\n\nthen-new European Union, a nationwide surge of Euroscepticism would be the\n\nobvious explanation for Ukip's ascendency - but there is no strong evidence for\n\nthat in the poll. Although most people would like a say on Europe, there is no\n\nsense of urgency. Little more than one voter in every three (35%) demands an\n\ninstant referendum, compared with 13% who are content to wait till general\n\nelection day, and 30% who are happy to wait longer - until after David Cameron's\n\npromised renegotiation of membership. Some 14% say that the referendum should\n\nnever take place at all.\n\n\n\nJust before the prime minister's January speech, which first floated the\n\nprospect of an in/out plebiscite, ICM found a 51%-40% majority for quitting the\n\nEU. Far from rushing their leaders towards the door, voters have cooled on the\n\nidea since, and opinion is now almost evenly split: 43% say they would vote to\n\nquit, against a steady 40% who are inclined to stay in.\n\n\n\nSince January there has actually been a four-point drop in the proportion saying\n\nthey would definitely vote for Britain to leave the EU (a figure that now stands\n\nat 32%) and also in the proportion who would probably vote to leave (now 11%).\n\nTwice as many voters as before now say they are unsure about how they would vote\n\n- 17% as compared with 8% in January.\n\n\n\nOther recent polling by IpsosMori suggests that fewer than one voter in every 10\n\nregards Europe as the most pressing issue facing the country, a fraction of\n\nthose who named it as such in the late 1990s.\n\n\n\nAll of this should give pause for thought to the Tory MPs who will tomorrow use\n\na vote in the Commons to try to force Cameron to write his referendum promise\n\ninto law, but it also renders Ukip's sudden surge more mysterious. Success in\n\nthe shire elections has secured publicity, and thereby begotten more success -\n\nbut that still leaves those shire election results in need of explanation. The\n\npoll suggests that disgruntlement about a political class perceived as\n\nhopelessly out of touch could be the real root cause.\n\n\n\nThe fury of a Ukip vote - which is disproportionately male (25% of men), elderly\n\n(23% of pensioners) and poor (27% of voters in the unskilled DE occupational\n\ngrade) - is not restricted to Europe, but is far more diffuse. They dislike Ed\n\nMiliband (76% say he is doing a bad job) almost as much as the EU (which 77% say\n\nthey would definitely vote to quit). They are scarcely keener on David Cameron;\n\nthe way he does his job gets the thumbs-down from 68% of Ukip supporters. And\n\n55% believe David Cameron and Nick Clegg are wrong to try and govern together in\n\ncoalition.\n\n\n\nIn their distaste for Britain's established political leaders, the mood of Ukip\n\nvoters is simply a more extreme version of that besetting voters as a whole. The\n\nwider electorate flips the thumbs down at Miliband by a 48%-26% margin,\n\nvirtually unchanged from the nadir he registered last month, and by 50%-35% it\n\ndoes the same towards Cameron.\n\n\n\nAgainst this sort of competition, it is not hard to shine, but Farage's own\n\nratings - with 40% saying he is doing well against 23% who say the opposite -\n\nare remarkably positive for any politician in these anti-political times.\n\n\n\nICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by\n\ntelephone on 10-12 May 2013. Interviews were conducted across the country and\n\nthe results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of\n\nthe British Polling Council and abides by its rules.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion polls are the miners' canaries of democracy: on occasion they indicate\n\nsomething very nasty indeed coming down the tunnel. So our latest Guardian/ICM\n\npoll ought to keep every political leader awake at night. The \"none of the\n\nabove\" party is now vying with the Tories for second place; a total of 27% of\n\nvoters are opting either for Ukip or one of the nationalist parties or the\n\nGreens. That's a record jump of 11 points on last month, and it includes a small\n\nbut worrying increase in support for the BNP. It's not just a governing party\n\nproblem either, now. The surge for the \"others\" has hit them all. Each has lost\n\nfour points in a rejection of British mainstream politics without modern\n\nprecedent. Party leaders have some very hard thinking to do.\n\n\n\nAlmost the only certainty in all this is that a row over the tactics of a\n\nEuropean referendum, such as the one distracting David Cameron as he tries to do\n\nbusiness with President Obama, will only confirm voters in their suspicion that\n\npoliticians inhabit a parallel universe. It is clear from the regular Ipsos-Mori\n\nissues index that - as Ed Miliband pointed out again at the weekend - it is not\n\nEurope but the economy that remains by far the biggest concern for most voters.\n\nSince 2005, when the rejection of the European constitution appeared to mark the\n\nhigh water mark of integration, the proportion of voters reporting that they are\n\nconcerned about Europe has never gone above 10%, even if it has recently risen\n\nslightly amid the eurozone's woes.\n\n\n\nThis has two implications. First, Britain's place in Europe is a much bigger and\n\nmore serious issue than many voters seem ready to acknowledge. The nature of the\n\nUK's relationship is changing, as the continent develops an increasingly\n\nconsolidated inner core over which Britain has diminishing influence. This will\n\nmatter greatly over the next decade. It is more important than narrow party\n\nadvantage. However, instead of argument over the substance - echoes here of John\n\nMajor's Maastricht misery - Mr Cameron finds himself abroad (and at sea) as\n\nrebels mount a challenge round a piece of parliamentary procedure: the vote on\n\nthe Queen's speech. As a result, Mr Cameron has had to allow his most senior\n\nministers to abstain rather than back their own government's business programme.\n\nThere is a precedent for this, but not an auspicious one. The last prime\n\nminister unable to rally his own cabinet in support of official policy was\n\nHarold Wilson in 1975, forced in the referendum on Europe to let the original\n\nEurosceptics campaign against staying in.\n\n\n\nIt is appealing to see Europe as some kind of a surrogate issue for a more\n\ngeneralised sense of powerlessness and discontent that feeds into a mistrust of\n\nall parties. That's the argument the rebels make in defence of their demand for\n\na commitment to a referendum before the 2015 general election. But it does not\n\nappear to be how voters are thinking. Since David Cameron's January promise of a\n\nreferendum after renegotiation, the balance of opinion has swung very marginally\n\nin favour of staying put. That suggests that rocketing support for Nigel Farage,\n\nUkip's leader, may owe at least as much to his attraction as an outsider as to\n\nhis anti-immigration, anti-European stance.\n\n\n\nHistorically, the kind of surge our poll has found rarely lasts. But this\n\nextended economic stagnation, the impact of persistently high unemployment and\n\nfrozen earnings, is creating a new and potentially malign political landscape.\n\nVoters are frustrated by the government's apparent inability to defend them. Mr\n\nFarage seems to meet an appetite, fanned by a press that has an active\n\nself-interest in promoting weak government, for dramatic solutions. The\n\npopularity of coalition as an idea has fallen sharply from its high three years\n\nago. But the stronger the support for Mr Farage, the dimmer are the prospects\n\nfor the clear mandate that voters now say they favour and for which both Labour\n\nand Conservatives yearn. Coalition is becoming more likely and less popular than\n\nat the same stage in the last election. Voters need to wise up, too.\n\n\n\n",

Up to history's challenge stepped\n\nNicholas Soames, through whose veins courses the blood of his grandfather the\n\nwartime prime minister.\n\n\n\nAdmittedly Soames had decided to make his Churchillian oration during the NHS\n\nstage of the debate on the Queen's speech and to do so on the tenuously\n\nconnected subject of Europe. But when destiny calls a Churchill, the summons\n\nmust be answered immediately.\n\n\n\nUp to that point the debate had been dire. The NHS's new cheerleader, Jeremy\n\nHunt, made a complacent speech on the service's \"heroic\" performance in tough\n\ntimes, as incumbent health secretaries must. Then Labour's Andy Burnham warned\n\nhow the arteries of our once-thriving hospitals are being clogged up by Tory\n\npolicies, as ex-health secretaries usually do.\n\n\n\nBut Europe kept barging its way into the conversation like a drunk in a pub.\n\nLabour's Frank Dobson complained that the Tories have opened the NHS to\n\npredatory US health firms via EU contract law, Thatcherite Tory Edward Leigh\n\nasked Burnham if he would grant the British people a referendum on Europe. \"Mad\n\nobsessives,\" was the drift of Burnham's reply. What about the NHS?\n\n\n\nSo Soames's intervention came like a burst of Chopin's First Ballade (Opus 23)\n\nduring Britain's Got Talent. He even boomed in the unapologetically posh way\n\nEtonians used to speak before rough trade like the Camerons were admitted. The\n\nthrust of Soames's pro-European remarks was that young Cameron had made a\n\npromise and that should be enough. His stated EU policy should certainly not be\n\nchallenged by the \"prejudice or pub rhetoric\" of some Tory MPs - no names - or\n\ntheir \"hysterical, kneejerk, publicity-seeking acts.\"\n\n\n\nHe spoke of trust and the integrity of government, of a momentous decision\n\naffecting generations unborn. It was magnificent stuff and, like many of\n\ngrandpa's speeches in his wilderness years (1931-39), was received with\n\nindifference and a solitary \"hear, hear\".\n\n\n\nBut Soames's speech certainly raised the tone. Two speeches later Labour's Ann\n\nClwyd silenced her chattering audience simply by reading letters from voters\n\nabout poor nursing care of elderly parents. It was shameful. Hospital buzzers\n\ndeliberately left out of reach, frightened old people left in pain while nurses\n\nchattered about their social life. A man saying goodbye to his father before the\n\nlife support machine is turned off being asked: \"Can we crack on now?\"\n\n\n\nIt was bad luck the next speaker was Charles Walker, the self-styled \"fruitcake\"\n\nTory. After praising Soames he confessed to personal Euroscepticism, then said:\n\n\"I do want to crack on now.\" Watch out for the switch on that life support\n\nmachine, Dave.\n\n\n\n",

No 10 is offering backbenchers a free vote and\n\nministers the right to abstain.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister says that, if elected with a majority in 2015, he would hold\n\na referendum by 2017. This would take place after a renegotiation of Britain's\n\nmembership terms.\n\n\n\nFriends of Gove told the Mail on Sunday last year he had said Britain should\n\nleave the EU unless substantial powers were repatriated. Asked whether he stood\n\nby those private remarks, he said: \"Yes, I'm not happy with our position in the\n\nEU.\"\n\n\n\nGove said he supported the plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU\n\nmembership after the election. But he added that life outside the EU could have\n\nbenefits. \"My preference is for a change in Britain's relationship with the\n\nEuropean Union. My ideal is exactly what the majority of the British public's\n\nideal is, which is to recognise the current situation is no good, to say that\n\nlife outside would be perfectly tolerable, we could contemplate it, there would\n\nbe certain advantages.\n\n\n\n\"But the best deal for Europe, and for Britain, would be if Britain were to lead\n\nthe change that Europe needs.\" Explaining his abstention, he said: \"I'm going to\n\nabstain . . . it's an exercise in letting off steam.\"\n\n\n\nHammond, interviewed for Pienaar's Politics on BBC radio, said: \"If the choice\n\nis between a European Union written exactly as it is today and not being a part\n\nof that then I have to say that I'm on the side of the argument that Michael\n\nGove has put forward.\"\n\n\n\nTheresa May, the home secretary, said she too would abstain. But she declined to\n\nsay whether she would vote to leave the EU if a referendum were held now. The\n\nprime minister will be in the US when the Commons vote is held.\n\n\n\nYesterday, Boris Johnson backed Tory backbench demands for an EU referendum bill\n\nand warned Cameron he must make it clear Britain is \"ready to walk away\" unless\n\nits relationship is fundamentally reformed,\n\n\n\nBut the mayor of London also suggested that leaving the EU would expose the idea\n\nthat most of Britain's problems are self-inflicted. \"If we left the EU, we would\n\nend this sterile debate, and we would have to recognise that most of our\n\nproblems are not caused by 'Bwussels', but by chronic British short-termism,\n\ninadequate management, sloth, low skills, a culture of easy gratification and\n\nunderinvestment in both human and physical capital and infrastructure,\" Johnson\n\nwrote in his Daily Telegraph column.\n\n\n\n\"Why are we still, person for person, so much less productive than the Germans?\n\nThat is now a question more than a century old, and the answer is nothing to do\n\nwith the EU. In or out of the EU, we must have a clear vision of how we are\n\ngoing to be competitive in a global economy.\"\n\n\n\nMinisters have been excluded from a free vote granted to Tory backbenchers to\n\nsupport the rebel amendment - with about 100 MPs expected to take the rare step\n\nof formally criticising their own government's legislative programme.\n\n\n\nCameron will show he believes Britain's long-term future lies in the EU by\n\nsaying at the meeting with Obama that next month's G8 summit must launch\n\nnegotiations on the EU-US free trade area. .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron is \"hiding behind the sofa\" from Tory backbenchers, Ed Miliband\n\nclaims today, after it emerged that the prime minister may take the\n\nunprecedented step of supporting a vote in parliament condemning his own\n\nlegislative programme because it does not propose a vote on EU membership.\n\n\n\nThe Labour leader will claim that the prime minister's decision to back an\n\namendment to the Queen's speech which criticises the absence of an in-out\n\nreferendum reveals an obsession with the party's interests instead of the\n\ncountry's.\n\n\n\nMiliband's speech comes as Cameron faces further pressure on Europe from senior\n\nparty figures. Yesterday, Boris Johnson said that withdrawal would not be\n\n\"cataclysmic\" for British jobs, as Europhiles claim. The mayor of London was\n\nspeaking after Tory grandees Lord Lawson and Michael Portillo this week\n\nadvocated withdrawal from the EU and Tory backbenchers sought a referendum\n\namendment to the Queen's speech. Internal Conservative rows over Europe have\n\nescalated following the strong showing of Ukip in the local elections this\n\nmonth.\n\n\n\nMiliband's speech, to the annual conference of the Blairite thinktank Progress,\n\nwill also be seen as an attempt to stamp his authority on his own party after\n\nYouGov polling showed that his personal polling has hardly improved over the\n\nlast year.\n\n\n\nMiliband will say: \"We have the extraordinary spectacle of a government that\n\nsays it is relaxed about its own MPs voting against its own Queen's speech.\n\n\n\n\"He (Cameron) is not lying on the sofa relaxed. He's hiding behind the sofa, too\n\nscared to confront his own MPs. He is flailing around, directionless, unable to\n\nshow the leadership the country needs.\"\n\n\n\nThe reason for this weakness, Miliband will say, is that Cameron has allowed\n\nbackbench MPs to push him around. \"That's the only reason he changed his mind in\n\nJanuary on his previous position on an in/out referendum. It wasn't about the\n\nnational interest, it was simply about his party interest.\"\n\n\n\nConservative MPs have engineered a vote on an EU referendum by tabling an\n\namendment to the Queen's speech. The move has the support of longstanding\n\nEurosceptics such as John Redwood, Peter Bone, Edward Leigh, Bernard Jenkin and\n\nDavid Davis. It is likely that the Speaker will accept the amendment, with a\n\nvote in the Commons on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely the amendment will be passed, as the Lib Dems will oppose it\n\nalong with the vast majority of Labour MPs, but significant minority support\n\nwithin the Tories would be seized upon as an indication that Cameron is being\n\ndictated to by his party's backbenches.\n\n\n\nYesterday, the prime minister's spokesman refused to rule out supporting the\n\namendment. \"The amendment's only recently been tabled, so the PM would want to\n\ncarefully consider it. The key point here is that he has always made it clear\n\nthat he will look at all ways of strengthening his commitment to an in/out\n\nreferendum in the next parliament.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister is even considering voting for the change to the government's\n\nprogramme, though this is highly unlikely because he is due to be in the US next\n\nweek. At present Cameron wants to hold the referendum after he has completed\n\nnegotiations with his EU partners after the 2015 general election.\n\n\n\nJohnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We should be prepared to pull out.\n\nThat goes without saying. You can't go into a negotiation like that without\n\nbeing willing to walk away.\"\n\n\n\nHe insisted that withdrawal would not be as damaging to the UK economy as\n\npro-Europeans claim. \"I don't think it would be anything like as cataclysmic as\n\nis being sometimes pretended,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nEd Miliband claims that David Cameron is 'hiding behind the sofa' from his\n\nbackbenchers on the issue of the EU\n\n\n\n",

But\n\ninstead Clegg was forced to concede he had rejected a key plank of the\n\ncoalition's childcare strategy.\n\n\n\nFaced by massive opposition from pre-school lobby groups, Clegg said he was now\n\nopposed to previously agreed plans to relax staff-to-child ratios in nurseries.\n\n\n\n\"When we as a government consulted on changing the number of little toddlers\n\nthat each adult can look after, the response from experts, from parents from\n\nnurseries was overwhelmingly negative,\" Clegg said. \"They felt that the risks\n\noutweighed the benefits and it wouldn't necessarily reduce costs. So that's what\n\nI still have reservations about, about this change.\"\n\n\n\nBut, faced by Labour claims that the coalition was descending into chaos on key\n\nissues, Liz Truss, the Conservative children's minister, insisted ministers were\n\nonly \"currently consulting on the level of qualifications required to put those\n\nratios in place\", implying the ratios policy itself was immutable.\n\n\n\nTory ministerial sources privately accused the Liberal Democrats' leader of\n\nleaking his new opposition in order to grub for votes among women. \"We had all\n\nthese discussions before the coalition came to an agreed position, so why he is\n\njumping ship now?\" said one.\n\n\n\nBut hours later Cameron, dogged by the issue of a European referendum for the\n\nfourth day in a row, also shifted ground when he found himself outmanoeuvred by\n\nhis Eurosceptic rebels. In a rare move, heavyweight Tory backbenchers tabled an\n\namendment to acceptance of the Queen's speech, regretting the lack of a bill in\n\nthe speech paving the way for an EU referendum. The amendment will be voted on\n\nnext Tuesday.\n\n\n\nFaced by the prospect of large-scale rebellion, Downing Street suggested Tory\n\nministers would be given a free vote next week, adding that Cameron was relaxed\n\nabout how his MPs voted. Supporters of the backbench Eurosceptic amendment,\n\nincluding the former shadow home secretary David Davis, say it is carefully\n\nworded to back the prime minister's position.\n\n\n\nCameron has told Conservative MPs he would like to introduce a bill guaranteeing\n\na referendum by 2017, but has been unable to do so because the Lib Dems\n\ndisagree.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman said: \"He is relaxed about (the amendment). He is\n\nhappy to look at all ways of strengthening his commitment to an in/out\n\nreferendum in the next parliament.\"\n\n\n\nThe spokesman suggested that people should not be surprised if Conservative and\n\nLib Dem ministers voted on opposite sides if the amendment was, as expected,\n\ncalled by the Speaker.\n\n\n\nCameron will miss the vote because he will be in the US. The prime minister's\n\nspokesman said: \"The differences on this specific issue between the two parties\n\nin the coalition are well known.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether the prime minister would be happy for ministers to vote for the\n\namendment, the spokesman said: \"The prime minister is relaxed about it.

Some MPs have\n\nclaimed, off the record, that they are being victimised because of years of\n\nexpenses abuses by their predecessors.\n\n\n\nThe watchdog moved to ban the use of Commons expenses to pay mortgage interest\n\nin May 2010, in the wake of public fury about abuses. Transitional arrangements\n\nwere put in place permitting MPs elected before 2010 to keep claiming the money\n\nup to last August - as long as they agreed to return any potential capital gain.\n\n\n\nSome 71 members received about Â£1m in allowances for mortgage interest during\n\nthe period. Properties were valued in 2010 and 2012, and the MPs were given\n\nuntil 30 November to return a proportion of any gain. The process was delayed\n\nwhen some signalled that they were considering a legal challenge on the grounds\n\nthat the watchdog had overstepped its powers.\n\n\n\nJackson, a member of the public accounts committee, said Ipsa's legal\n\nproceedings were heavy-handed and disproportionate and were clearly intended to\n\nbully him into submission.\n\n\n\n\"The essence of the dispute is my challenge of the valuations of 2010 and 2012.\n\nIpsa are seeking a cash sum on a so-called capital gain 'profit' on my family\n\nhome, in which I live and have not sold. The money which Ipsa is demanding\n\nretrospectively is more than the total amount I received when I was claiming\n\nmortgage interest and the property is now valued at less than we purchased it\n\nfor in 2005.\"\n\n\n\nJackson, who resigned as a junior minister in 2010 after voting against a\n\nthree-line whip on an EU referendum, wrote that he would challenge the\n\nwatchdog's claim that his family home - which he bought for Â£470,000 in December\n\n2005 - increased in value by 20% at a time when he says house prices in the area\n\nwere falling.\n\n\n\nIn total, the 71 MPs claimed Â£926,159.75 of taxpayer cash to cover mortgage\n\ninterest over the 15-month period, with the largest claims made by Labour's\n\nMichael Connarty - who received Â£34,168 relating to a property in London, of\n\nwhich he has returned Â£6,833 - and Jackson, who received Â£32,494.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Ipsa said: \"One of the most damaging aspects of the expenses\n\nscandal was the practice where MPs got taxpayer support to own a second home.\n\nThat is why we said we would stop this, and we have now done so.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nTory MP Stewart Jackson is refusing to pay all the money, saying he disputes the\n\nvaluation of his home in Peterborough\n\n\n\n",

The whole point of the prime\n\nminister's speech (on the EU) in January was to head off Ukip. Tory MPs were\n\ncrowing the Ukip fox had been shot - job done, mission accomplished. Only it\n\nwasn't.\n\n\n\n\"The lesson for the prime minister is you can't out-Farage Farage. Banging on\n\nabout Europe won't convince the public, and the people behind him will keep\n\ncoming back for more. A Europe referendum tomorrow, drop same-sex marriage, the\n\ndemands go on. They will never be satisfied.\" Miliband attacked Cameron after\n\nthe government moved to address the concerns raised by voters who have defected\n\nto Ukip by unveiling a new immigration bill in the Queen's speech which will\n\nimpose fines on private landlords who fail to check the immigrant status of\n\ntheir tenants.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there was no mention of the bill legalising gay marriage, which was\n\nintroduced in the last session and is being carried over into the new session.\n\n\n\nUnder the immigration plans, migrants will also face new restrictions on access\n\nto the NHS, with temporary migrants forced to make a contribution towards the\n\ncost of their care. However, Downing Street admitted that the immigration bill\n\nwould not be in place by next January, when labour market restrictions are\n\nlifted on citizens of Romania and Bulgaria. The bill will be introduced after\n\nthe summer parliamentary recess, following a consultation on the proposed fines\n\non private landlords and on the changes in NHS charging.\n\n\n\nGovernment sources said the main measures aimed at Romanians and Bulgarians\n\nwould be introduced through secondary legislation that would be in place by next\n\nJanuary. These include a residency test for social housing, a requirement for\n\nmigrants to have been resident in the UK for at least 12 months before they are\n\nentitled to claim civil legal aid and the plan to limit most jobseeker benefits\n\nfor European Economic Area citizens if they fail to find work within six months.\n\n\n\nCameron told MPs the immigration bill was the centrepiece of the legislative\n\nprogramme because it cut across all government departments. He said: \"For the\n\nfirst time, we will look to ensure that everyone's immigration status is checked\n\nbefore they get access to a private rented home. For the first time, we are\n\ngoing to make sure that anyone not eligible for free healthcare actually foots\n\nthe bill for that healthcare, either through themselves or through their\n\ngovernment. And for the first time, foreign nationals who commit serious crimes\n\nwill, wherever possible, be deported first and appeal second from their home\n\ncountry.\"\n\n\n\nVince Cable, the business secretary, indicated that there may still be a battle\n\nwithin the coalition over plans to monitor migrants' use of the NHS. He told the\n\nBBC's The World at One that doctors must not be expected to make such checks.\n\n\n\n\"That is not the role of doctors - doctors are there to provide medical care,\"\n\nhe said. \"There is a question about whether people who administer GPs' surgeries\n\nand hospitals should be in the business of checking. Actually there is a fair\n\namount of that goes on already.\"\n\n\n\nCameron indicated that the government had ambitious plans on foreign criminals\n\nwhen he said that senior ministers had examined plans at a meeting of the\n\nnational security council last week to deport foreign nationals as soon as they\n\nare sentenced. He made his remarks after Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the\n\nCommons home affairs select committee, said 4,000 foreign national ex-offenders\n\nwere living in the community, 65% of whom had been doing so for two years.\n\n\n\nCameron said to Vaz: \"The situation with foreign national offenders is still\n\ncompletely unacceptable. There are very large numbers still here from countries\n\nlike Nigeria, Jamaica and others that we have very good relations with. We are\n\ngoing to make sure we deal with this problem a lot faster.\"\n\n\n\nCameron faced criticism for abandoning plans to force tobacco companies to use\n\nplain packaging and to introduce a minimum price for alcohol, but he said: \"On\n\nthe issue of plain packaging for cigarettes, that consultation is still under\n\nway and we are looking very carefully at that issue. On the issue of minimum\n\nunit pricing for alcohol, I think it is important we take action to deal with\n\nthe very deeply discounted alcohol - a can of lager sometimes at as little as\n\n25p in supermarkets. We will be coming forward with a package of measures. That\n\nis important and we need to get that right.\"\n\n\n\nLabour said the tobacco packaging consultation actually closed last August.\n\n\n\nPeter Luff, the MP for Mid Worcestershire and former Tory defence minister, who\n\nwas the first MP to respond to the Queen's speech as he delivered the\n\ntraditional backbench proposal, warned Cameron against attempting to appease\n\nUkip.\n\n\n\nFarage, Ukip's leader, said: \"It was a Queen's speech designed to tell Ukip\n\nvoters: 'Don't worry, we are dealing with things.'\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband arrive for the Queen's speech\n\n\n\n",

My ministers will continue to prioritise measures that\n\nreduce the deficit - ensuring interest rates are kept low for homeowners and\n\nbusinesses.\"\n\n\n\nWhat it means Deficit reduction gets a lower profile than it did in the speeches\n\nin 2010 and in 2012. In both those years, it was in the second sentence in the\n\nspeech, and described as the government's first priority. But, with borrowing\n\nessentially flat rather than going down, a comment like that was probably deemed\n\na bit embarrassing.\n\n\n\nWhat she said \"A bill will be introduced to reduce the burden of excessive\n\nregulation on businesses. A further bill will make it easier for businesses to\n\nprotect their intellectual property. A draft bill will be published establishing\n\na simple set of consumer rights.\"\n\n\n\nWhat it means A deregulation bill enacts some measures that emerged from the\n\ngovernment's \"red tape challenge\", including exempting from health and safety\n\nlegislation self-employed people whose work poses no threat to others. An\n\nintellectual property bill will make stealing registered designs and selling\n\ncounterfeit products for profit a criminal offence punishable by up to 10 years\n\nin prison. A draft consumer rights bill will ensure that consumer law applies to\n\nthe purchase of digital content.\n\n\n\nWhat she said \"Legislation will be introduced to enable the building of the High\n\nSpeed Two railway line, providing further opportunities for economic growth in\n\nmany of Britain's cities. My government will continue with legislation to update\n\nenergy infrastructure.\"\n\n\n\nWhat it means There are actually two high speed rail bills: one, the high speed\n\nrail (preparation) bill, providing the funding for the scheme, and a second, an\n\nHS2 hybrid bill, allowing the project to go ahead. This is one of the few bills\n\nunpopular on the Tory backbenches to get a mention. The energy bill, which will\n\nencourage private investment in the energy sector, is one of several measures\n\nbeing \"carried over\" under a procedure used increasingly regularly.\n\n\n\nWhat she said \"To make sure that every child has the best start in life,\n\nregardless of background, further measures will be taken to improve the quality\n\nof education for young people.\"\n\n\n\nWhat it means This is the Michael Gove section of the speech, referring to\n\nschool reforms that are already in the pipeline. There is no new legislation\n\nplanned in this field, although some of the measures relating to childcare are\n\nincluded in the children and families bill, another carry over measure.\n\n\n\nWhat she said \"My government will bring forward legislation to create a simpler\n\nstate pension system that encourages saving and provides more help to those who\n\nhave spent years caring for children.\"\n\n\n\nWhat it means The pensions bill will introduce a single-tier pension scheme, and\n\nincrease the state pension age to 67. This is a central part of the government's\n\npitch to women, who are polling badly for the Tories.\n\n\n\nWhat she said \"Legislation will be introduced to reform the way long-term care\n\nis paid for, to ensure the elderly do not have to sell their homes to meet their\n\ncare bills.\"\n\n\n\nWhat it means This is the first major piece of legislation to get a mention in\n\nthe speech - the care bill. It will implement the proposals that were put\n\nforward by the government following the Dilnot review capping the amount people\n\npay towards their elderly care.\n\n\n\nWhat she said \"My government will bring forward a bill that further reforms\n\nBritain's immigration system.\"\n\n\n\nWhat it means The immigration bill is the third big piece of legislation in the\n\nspeech, which has been well trailed in advance and read as a response to the\n\nthreat from Ukip.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron faced growing Tory pressure on Europe last night when the former\n\ncabinet minister Michael Portillo threw his weight behind the call by Lord\n\nLawson for Britain to leave the EU.\n\n\n\nAs Boris Johnson entered the fray, by saying Britain should be prepared to quit\n\nif it fails to secure better membership terms, Portillo said he fervently hopes\n\nthe British people have the guts to vote no.\n\n\n\nThe intervention by a second Tory grandee came as Charles Moore, Margaret\n\nThatcher's official biographer, revealed that the late prime minister came to\n\nbelieve after she left office that Britain should quit the EU. Writing in this\n\nweek's issue of the Spectator, Moore says that Thatcher kept her opinion private\n\nafter she was advised that her views would push her to the fringes of public\n\nlife.\n\n\n\nThe call this week by Lawson, Thatcher's longest-serving chancellor, for Britain\n\nto leave the EU transformed the debate in the Conservative party by providing\n\ncover for MPs who felt nervous about speaking out.\n\n\n\nPortillo today adds fuel to the fire by saying that Britain must leave the EU or\n\nrisk finding that it has no choice in the future but to join the euro and to\n\nenter political union with the rest of the EU.\n\n\n\nWriting in the Times, which also carried Lawson's article earlier this week,\n\nPortillo says: \"The referendum, were it to occur, would not be simply about\n\nwithdrawing from the EU or going on as we are. It would really be about pulling\n\nout, or in due course entering political union.\n\n\n\n\"That is why I would vote no and I fervently hope that the British have more\n\nguts than those who govern us, and more than those who govern us think we have.\"\n\n\n\nPortillo says Lawson is wrong to assert that Britain will have a referendum on\n\nEU membership. Cameron pledged in his speech on the EU in January that he would\n\nhold a referendum by 2017 after negotiating a series of reforms to the EU with\n\nfellow European leaders.\n\n\n\nBut the former defence secretary writes: \"I have not been impressed by Mr\n\nCameron's pledge. Given his party's electoral prospects, I doubt if he expects\n\nto have to deliver on it. But in any case, he seems to have decided already that\n\nBritain should stay in.\"\n\n\n\nJohnson added to the pressure on Cameron, who claims his strategy is designed to\n\nstabilise Britain's membership in a reformed EU, by saying Britain may have to\n\nleave. The London mayor told the Times that it was \"much less clear\" that\n\nBritain would suffer if it left.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron will today make his most concerted effort yet to prevent a\n\nstampede of his core vote to Ukip by unveiling measures to stem the flow of EU\n\nmigrants to Britain, including imposing fines on private landlords if they do\n\nnot check the immigration status of their tenants.\n\n\n\nLandlords will face fines of thousands of pounds under proposals due to be\n\nunveiled in the Queen's speech today.\n\n\n\nThe political centrepiece of Cameron's third Queen's speech will be a promise to\n\nrestrict EU migrants' access to jobseeker's allowance to six months, issue new\n\nguidance to local authorities to give priority to local people in social\n\nhousing, and place new responsibilities on EU member states to pay if their\n\ncitizens use the NHS.\n\n\n\nThere will also be tougher fines on businesses that use illegal labour.\n\n\n\nThe six-month restriction to jobseeker's allowance will apply to all EU\n\nnationals who are not actively seeking work and cannot show that they have a\n\ngenuine chance of getting work.\n\n\n\nCameron will introduce a new residence test requiring most individuals to be\n\nlawfully resident in the UK for at least 12 months before they gain access to\n\ncivil legal aid. But the measures, designed to slow the flow of workers to the\n\nUK, come only a day before new EU commission proposals designed to make it\n\neasier for EU citizens to work anywhere in the EU.\n\n\n\nCameron hopes that such raw meat will soothe the disaffection on the right that\n\nwas revealed in last week's local elections. But he will also hope to quell the\n\ngrowing clamour on the Tory backbenches for a referendum bill on EU membership\n\nin this parliamentary session.\n\n\n\nAn exasperated Cameron was yesterday forced to welcome a call from the\n\n81-year-old Lord Lawson for Britain to quit the EU. The former chancellor said\n\nit was a bureaucratic monstrosity damaging the interests of the City of London.\n\nCameron found himself on the back foot, defending his plans to renegotiate the\n\nterms of Britain's EU membership in the face of Lawson's contemptuous assessment\n\nthat he will secure only \"piffling changes\".\n\n\n\nAs Conservative MPs hailed Lawson for creating a \"game-changing\" moment, the\n\nprime minister rejected Lawson's intervention and insisted he would be able to\n\nsecure real changes in Britain's membership terms.\n\n\n\n\"I want to give people a choice not between the status quo and leaving the\n\nEuropean Union,\" the prime minister said at a conference on Somalia in London.\n\n\n\n\"I want to give people a proper choice between Britain remaining in a reformed\n\nEU or leaving that EU. That's the choice that people will have. That is the\n\nchoice that people want. And there is only one way to get it and that will be by\n\nsupporting the Conservatives at the next election. Frankly, I welcome the\n\nattention that is being put on this very clear promise.\"\n\n\n\nBut Bernard Jenkin, the former shadow defence secretary, sided with Lawson,\n\nsaying it was \"moonshine\" for No 10 to assume Cameron could reform the EU.\n\n\n\nSome Tories responded to Lawson's remarks by saying he had afforded\n\nrespectability to Ukip. They also said that the former chancellor had given\n\ncover to anti-EU Tory MPs who have been nervous about speaking out.\n\n\n\nOne MP said: \"The Lawson intervention is transformational; it is potentially a\n\ngame changing moment. Ukip can say to us: 'You said we were fruitcakes and now\n\nMargaret Thatcher's longest-serving chancellor says we are right.' Conservatives\n\nwho want to leave the EU but who have been nervous about saying so will now feel\n\nless worried about saying that.\"\n\n\n\nLawson's intervention, in The Times yesterday, also led to an array of Tory MPs\n\ntouring the TV studios to argue over Britain's relationship with the EU.\n\n\n\nThe latest development has probably crushed Cameron's lingering hope that he had\n\nmanage to shelve the EU issue by promising in January that he would hold an\n\nin-out referendum after the 2015 election. With the Liberal Democrats opposed to\n\na bill on a referendum ahead of the election, the prime minister is unable to\n\nsatisfy his backbench rebels.\n\n\n\nTheresa May, the home secretary, will use the immigration bill, due to be fully\n\npublished in the autumn, to address another touchstone issue by recasting the\n\nlaw to make it easier to deport suspected criminals or terrorists such as the\n\nMuslim preacher Abu Qatada.\n\n\n\nMay will change the law to make it impossible for such figures to remain in the\n\nUK by citing Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, and the right to family life.\n\n\n\nMinisters say the Article had been abused by criminals to circumvent rules that\n\nautomatically deport any offender sentenced to more than 12 months in prison.\n\nShe has already issued guidance to the UK judiciary, but believes only the full\n\nforce of a change in the law will persuade UK judges not to defer to the Human\n\nRights Act in such cases.\n\n\n\nCameron's aides insisted the emphasis on the EU and immigration in the Queen's\n\nspeech had been decided ahead of Ukip's surge. They argued that the whole of the\n\nspeech should be seen through the prism of Cameron's twin themes of winning the\n\nglobal race and backing those who work hard to get on in life.\n\n\n\nThe PM will acknowledge how tough voters are finding the squeeze on living\n\nstandards, saying: \"We knew the road ahead would be tough, and so it has proved.\n\nBut three years on, our resolve to turn our country around has never been\n\nstronger.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nFormer chancellor Lord Lawson called for Britain to quit the EU, saying it is a\n\n'bureaucratic monstrosity' damaging the City\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nTrouble, thy name is Nigel. Or so it must seem to David Cameron. In a week, the\n\nprime minister's authority has been rocked by Nigel Farage, shaken by the Nigel\n\nEvans allegations and now openly challenged by the most important Nigel in\n\nrecent Conservative history. It is 24 years since Nigel Lawson's resignation\n\nsignalled the endgame of Margaret Thatcher's premiership. And it needs to be\n\nstressed that, for most people under the age of 40, the former chancellor is\n\nmuch less of a name these days than his daughter. Nevertheless, Lord Lawson\n\nproved this week that, at 81, he is still one of the most articulate figures in\n\npolitics and has lost none of his sense of theatre. By saying, on the eve of the\n\nQueen's Speech, that he thinks Britain should now quit the European Union, he\n\nhas poured petrol on the flames already licking through the Conservative mansion\n\nafter last week's local election defeats.\n\n\n\nThere can be no disputing that Lord Lawson's change of heart on the EU - he\n\nvoted yes to British membership, along with Lady Thatcher herself, back in 1975\n\n- reflects his party's own historic change of view over Europe, between the Ted\n\nHeath era and that of David Cameron. It is representative, too, of the more\n\nsceptical mood of the public, judging by the opinion polls. But it goes\n\ncompletely against Mr Cameron's optimism that he can negotiate a new\n\nrelationship with the EU and win a referendum to endorse that view - and Lord\n\nLawson knows this very well. The former chancellor has therefore chosen his time\n\nwith malice aforethought, in order to make life much harder for the prime\n\nminister.\n\n\n\nLord Lawson's move is also a reminder that, for all his occasional brilliance,\n\nhe sometimes calls big things wrong. It was he who encouraged sterling to shadow\n\nthe Deutschmark so that the UK could join the European fixed exchange rate\n\nsystem - only for the ejection of the UK from that system in 1992 to seal the\n\nTory party's fate for a generation. It is he who, in increasingly dismissive\n\nterms, has become this country's leading climate change denier - a stance that\n\nhas given a more general permission to the Tory party to back off from the\n\nscientific approach to which Lady Thatcher, no less, first led it. And it is he\n\nwho, only 18 months ago, wrote that the eurozone needed time and the EU needed\n\nreform to get themselves through their crises - yet it is he who has now\n\nabandoned the patient approach and who is prejudging the whole outcome.\n\n\n\nLord Lawson is not just wrong about the underlying issue of Britain and Europe.\n\nHe is also wrong even from his own party's point of view. His move is doomed to\n\nmake life more difficult for both Mr Cameron and for the Tory party - and thus\n\nto make it much harder for the Tories to win the 2015 election and be able to\n\nhold the referendum which the prime minister promised in his speech in January\n\nand on which so much is now staked.\n\n\n\nThe Tory party has been spooked by Ukip's successes in the local elections. Many\n\nTories wish their party embraced Ukip's signature policy of EU withdrawal. They\n\ndraw the false conclusion that a more strongly Eurosceptic stance will reduce\n\nthe Ukip threat, which, they reason, would allow the Tories to recapture their\n\npopularity and a majority in 2015. In fact, Lord Lawson's move means the reverse\n\nis more likely to be true - as the polls also suggested after Mr Cameron's\n\nJanuary speech. The more that the Tories show themselves obsessed with Europe,\n\nwhich is not the main issue facing this country, the more they appear out of\n\ntouch with public concerns and the more their divisions give voters permission\n\nto look elsewhere, including, ironically, to Ukip.\n\n\n\nAll this forms an unimpressive political backdrop to the new parliamentary\n\nsession today. In the last full session before the 2015 general election\n\novershadows everything, the government ought to be focused on the public's\n\npriorities, not on those of the Tory party. Instead, the Tory part of the\n\ncoalition seems to have got everything the wrong way around. It is therefore a\n\nmoment of opportunity not for the Tories, but for their political opponents.\n\n\n\n",

One MP said the intervention by Lawson - pictured above\n\nwith Thatcher in 1985 - in yesterday's Times was a \"game-changing\" moment that\n\ngave respectability to Ukip.\n\n\n\nJenkin said Lawson's remarks highlighted the need for a referendum within the\n\nnext two years. Cameron, who has pledged to hold a referendum by 2017 if he wins\n\nthe next election, wrote to his MPs yesterday to say he could not legislate for\n\na referendum this parliament because the Liberal Democrats are currently opposed\n\nto the move.\n\n\n\nBut No 10 sources have said the prime minister might be prepared to support a\n\nbackbench private member's bill in the new session of parliament, which opens\n\ntoday, that would allow a referendum before the election. Jenkin said the prime\n\nminister needed to act fast.\n\n\n\nAsked on Channel 4 News if there might be parliamentary defections to Ukip if no\n\nreferendum was held, Jenkin said: \"It is a very good question to ask. At the\n\nmoment the Conservative party is losing support to Ukip. There are people\n\ndefecting to Ukip. I think the Conservative party becomes increasingly difficult\n\nto manage.\"\n\n\n\nAsked again if it was possible there would be defections if Cameron failed to\n\ndeliver a referendum this parliament, Jenkin said: \"Of course it is a\n\npossibility . . . we're witnessing something of a political earthquake.\"\n\n\n\nIt is understood that Jenkin was not signalling that he or other senior figures\n\nwould defect.\n\n\n\nOne MP said: \"The Lawson intervention is transformational, a potentially\n\ngame-changing moment . . .

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponents of British membership of the European Union yesterday gained their\n\nmost prestigious recruit when the former chancellor Lord Lawson claimed the\n\nBritish economy would be better off outside the EU.\n\n\n\nLawson said the profoundly misguided aim of the EU was to create a federal\n\nEuropean superstate - a United States of Europe - and concluded \"that is not for\n\nus\". The EU, he said, has passed its sell-by date and has become \"a bureaucratic\n\nmonstrosity\" from which the UK should break free. After an association with\n\nBrussels of 40 years, he said, \"the case for exit is clear\".\n\n\n\nIn an article in the Times, Lawson writes that as a result he would vote for the\n\nUK to leave the EU if, as he hopes, the issue is put to the British people in a\n\nreferendum in 2017. Lawson, who was chancellor from 1983 to 1989 under the\n\nleadership of Margaret Thatcher, has previously said any renegotiation with the\n\nUK's EU partners would fail.\n\n\n\nHis latest remarks will embolden the growing Eurosceptic mood in the\n\nConservative party in the wake of last week's impressive county council election\n\nshowing by Ukip. It puts pressure on David Cameron to advance legislation on a\n\nreferendum on UK membership of the EU in this parliament, and even to hint he\n\nwill oppose continuing British membership unless he gains substantial\n\nconcessions in the talks he is planning with his European colleagues. Lawson\n\nsuggest Cameron will win no substantial reforms.\n\n\n\nWhile it was \"by no means assured\" that Cameron would win the 2015 general\n\nelection, Lawson said he believed public demand was such that a referendum would\n\nhave to happen under Labour in any case. Dismissing the chances of either party\n\nsecuring significant reforms, he said Brussels would fear a \"general\n\nunravelling\" as other countries sought to match the return of powers.\n\n\n\n\"The heart of the matter is that the very nature of the European Union, and of\n\nthis country's relationship with it, has fundamentally changed after the coming\n\ninto being of the European monetary union and the creation of the eurozone, of\n\nwhich - quite rightly - we are not a part.\n\n\n\n\"That is why, while I voted 'in' in 1975, I shall be voting 'out' in 2017,\" he\n\nwrites.\n\n\n\nLawson remains a respected figure in Tory circles and is seen as the great\n\nreforming chancellor under Thatcher.\n\n\n\nHe insists there would be advantages in the UK leaving the EU. He writes: \"You\n\ndo not need to be within the single market to be able to export to the European\n\nUnion, as we see from the wide range of goods on our shelves every day.\n\n\n\n\"The heart of the matter is that the relevant economic context nowadays is not\n\nEurope but globalisation, including global free trade, with the World Trade\n\nOrganisation as its monitor.\"\n\n\n\n\"Too much of British business and industry feels similarly secure in the warm\n\nembrace of the European single market and is failing to recognise that today's\n\ngreat export opportunities lie in the developing world, particularly in Asia.\n\n\n\n\"Just as entry into the Common Market half a century ago provided a much-needed\n\nchange of focus, so might leaving the EU, an institution that has achieved its\n\nhistoric purpose and is now past its sell-by date, provide a much-needed change\n\nof focus today.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't panic: a nice bit of policy will sort Ukip out. The Tory right urges not\n\none EU referendum but two. Those close to government emphasise moves on prison\n\n\"perks\", and items in this week's Queen's speech that will deal with immigrants'\n\naccess to benefits and the NHS. Meanwhile, pundits and politicians from all\n\nsides claim that Nigel Farage's grab-bag of proposals will fall apart under\n\nclose scrutiny, and the menace will recede.\n\n\n\nWell, maybe. Real politics is built on emotion and tribal affinity rather than\n\npolicy - and on this score, Ukip excels. So full of chutzpah and mischief that\n\nhe is talking about Ukip-Tory pacts, Farage knows the people for whom his party\n\nnow speaks: English conservatives, with both a small and large \"C\",\n\ndisproportionately found in the south-eastern working class (quite an\n\nachievement for a son of a stockbroker, alumnus of Dulwich College and former\n\nbanker). If you think the country has lost its way thanks to a cosseted\n\npolitical class, that immigration and so-called welfare are at the heart of the\n\nproblem, and that the Tories have little understanding of life as it actually\n\nlived, then you may well have voted Ukip as matter of visceral instinct.\n\n\n\nLast week, I spent time with Ukip in Essex. At least half were ex-Tories, from\n\ndecidedly non-posh backgrounds. I spoke to a few of their voters, too. At first,\n\nit was strange having so many conversations with people convinced that the\n\nConservatives had lost their way: what, I wondered, of the government's benefits\n\ncrackdown, or their clear wish to shrink the state? But in such towns as\n\nWickford, Billericay and Rayleigh, the disaffection runs much deeper than that.\n\n\n\nThe Conservatives have frayed their bond with what one pundit has called \"Tebbit\n\nTories\", who look at David Cameron and George Osborne and see a grim cultural\n\nhybrid, alienating beyond words: public-school conceit mixed with the kind of\n\nmetropolitan smarminess that Tony Blair stretched to snapping point. Worse\n\nstill, the Tory elite's distance from the nitty gritty is reflected in their\n\nlack of any firm offer to so many of their own voters - what does the modern\n\nConservative party think it can do for them?\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of occasions when the absurdity of the Tories' predicament is\n\nrevealed. When, for instance, Osborne popped up at a branch of Morrisons\n\naffecting a glottal stop and explaining the downsides of the benefits system\n\n(\"Briddish people badly wannit fixed,\" as one Telegraph writer translated it),\n\ndid he have any idea how awful it looked to the people he was trying to reach?\n\nEven if the Tories' politics and economics remain essentially Thatcherite, given\n\nthe backgrounds - if not the entire worldview - of the current leadership, the\n\nmedium cancels out the message.\n\n\n\n\"We have to break this impression of being privileged and out of touch,\" said\n\nthat working-class Tory David Davis over the weekend, doubtless aware that a\n\ngood way of showing how annoyed you are is to demand the impossible.\n\n\n\nIf you appreciate the old political brilliance the Tories have so mislaid, you\n\nwill understand why some view all this as a mounting tragedy. We are talking\n\nabout the party that wised up to the end of deference by collectively\n\nacknowledging that the era of grouse moors was drawing to a close, and placed\n\nmillions of ordinary Britons at the heart of its most successful phase - partly\n\nthanks to the sale of council houses, the kind of populist masterstroke that the\n\nCameroons can only dream about. If you read the best histories of the 1980s,\n\nit's all there: in One of Us, Hugo Young quotes Norman Tebbit paying tribute to\n\npeople \"who want to own things, make choices, live decently\", and describes how\n\nthe Thatcherites' \"patchy economic record\" could always be trumped by \"an\n\nattitude - the attitude Thatcher herself could trace directly back to Grantham\".\n\n\n\nWhere is that attitude now? A couple of cabinet members - Eric Pickles, and the\n\ntransport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin - still personify it, but they are\n\nhardly at the heart of things.\n\n\n\nThose who still admire Cameron would argue that the red-raw Conservatism that\n\nUkip voice will only attract an insufficient share of an electorate becoming\n\nmore urban, liberal and socially diverse. To which the answer is: this is as\n\nmuch about style as substance, and the fact that if you want to bang on about\n\nhard work, aspiration and opportunity, it might be an idea to find people with\n\nexperience of what they actually mean. In other words, even if some degree of\n\n\"modernisation\" was imperative, was it the wisest move to select a public-school\n\nclique to do it?\n\n\n\nAll this seems to be haunting the Tory soul, but note some other developments.\n\nAmong Cameron's recent moves has been the recruitment to policy roles of the\n\nEtonian MPs Jesse Norman (last heard putting the chumocracy down to his old\n\nschool's \"commitment to public service\") and Jo Johnson. And even among those\n\nwho recognise the Tory malaise, there is that incessant chorus claiming that the\n\nbest way to cure the Tories' ills is to hand the leadership to the latter's big\n\nbrother Boris.\n\n\n\nThat Old Etonian has assets Cameron and Osborne lack: human warmth, the ability\n\nto give the appearance of straight-taking, a Farage-ish personal brand, and - oh\n\nyes - an ability to win elections. He is stitched into the new establishment,\n\nwhile giving the impression he is some kind of maverick. Farage has been making\n\nappreciative noises about him; if the Tories' difficulties worsen, the banal\n\nidea that he is the answer may gain currency. If it does, I would prescribe a\n\nsimple course of action: any tempted Conservatives should spend a few days\n\noutside London, understand the profundity of their problems, and give it a\n\nlittle bit more thought.\n\n\n\njohn.harris@guardian.co.uk\n\n\n\n",

That is the day on which Ukip can cause\n\nan earthquake in British politics. I want to lead the party into that.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether he would stand for parliament in the 2015 general election, Farage\n\nsaid: \"Yes I will stand for a seat in 2015. I have been rather busy for the last\n\nfew weeks doing other things (to decide which seat to contest). But I will think\n\nabout it.\"\n\n\n\nFarage pointed out that Ukip was picking up votes not just from the Tories. He\n\nadded: \"Please don't think that Ukip is just some little pressure group that\n\nwill go away because somebody in Downing Street starts singing the same song.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nNigel Kennedy and Nigel Farage on the Andrew Marr Show Photo: Jeff Overs/BBC\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron will try to reach out to former Tory voters who defected to Ukip\n\nin the local elections by characterising next week's Queen's speech as a\n\nconcerted attempt to address their concerns over immigration and welfare.\n\n\n\nAs Tory MPs on the right of the party called for tougher action on Europe and\n\nimmigration, Downing Street was preparing to launch a media blitz over the\n\nweekend to show that the government is taking action in key areas highlighted by\n\nUkip.\n\n\n\nThe Queen's speech on Wednesday will contain measures to limit benefits to some\n\nimmigrants with a particular focus on placing restrictions on access to the NHS.\n\n\n\nThis is designed to show that the government is taking action ahead of the\n\nlifting of transitional controls on citizens from Romania and Bulgaria, who will\n\nhave full rights to work in the EU from next year.\n\n\n\nDowning Street is also indicating to Tory MPs that the prime minister is ready\n\nto back a private members' bill in the new session of parliament that would\n\nlegislate for an\n\n\n\nin/out referendum on Britain's EU membership after the next election.\n\n\n\nNo 10 acknowledged that it could not introduce any bill authorising an EU\n\nreferendum as a government measure in the face of Liberal Democrat opposition.\n\n\"It is impractical to bring it in as a government measure,\" one source said.\n\n\n\nDowning Street regarded the results in the English local elections as a mixed\n\nblessing. The Tories suffered the loss of 335 seats, comfortably within the\n\nrange predicted by psephologists, who said the party was bound to suffer on the\n\ngrounds that the seats were last contested in 2009 when Cameron was riding on a\n\nhigh the year before the general election.\n\n\n\nBut on the downside, many Tory voters defected to Ukip, ensuring that the Tories\n\nlost control of bastions in Lincolnshire and Norfolk. They had more success\n\nelsewhere, as they held on in counties such as Hertfordshire and Somerset.\n\n\n\nThe signals from No 10 came as Tories on the right called on Cameron to\n\nacknowledge the way in which Ukip is resonating. Sir Gerald Howarth, the\n\nThatcherite former defence minister, lamented the loss of a Conservative\n\ncouncillor in Hampshire and then added in a tweet: \"We need to take tougher\n\naction on serious concerns of the public on immigration and Europe.\"\n\n\n\nJohn Baron, the Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay, who is demanding\n\nlegislation during this parliament for an in/out EU referendum, said Ukip should\n\nno longer be seen as a protest party. \"Some of its members have genuine concerns\n\nabout the EU which we need to address,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMichael Gove, the education secretary, cautioned that there would be no lurch to\n\nthe right. \"There is no - and I don't think there should be - fundamental\n\nchange,\" he told Radio 4's The World at One.\n\n\n\nBut Gove, who said the government has taken action in many areas highlighted by\n\nUkip, acknowledged it was taking time for changes to be noticed. He said: \"When\n\nit comes to the concerns that voters have who didn't vote Conservative - some of\n\nwhom voted Ukip, some of whom didn't vote at all - I think there has been a gap\n\nbetween the decisions we have taken and the implementation on the ground which,\n\nnaturally, will cause some people to say to this government: we need to see\n\nresults.\n\n\n\n\"We are seeing results. There was hard parliamentary pounding in order to make\n\nsure we could change the welfare system so that once more we had an approach to\n\nbenefits which rewarded and incentivised work. It is only this week that the\n\nuniversal credit is being rolled out.\"\n\n\n\nGove also warned against any attempt to overthrow the prime minister after some\n\ndefeated councillors questioned his leadership. \"I think that any of my\n\ncolleagues who want to indulge in leadership speculation should spend the\n\nweekend reading the history books and consider if leadership speculation has\n\never helped any political party to enhance its position with the voters. The\n\nidea of changing the leader is bonkeroony.\"\n\n\n\nGove spoke out after Graham Marsh, who lost his seat in Lincolnshire after a\n\nUkip surge, told The World at One that his \"rockbed supporters\" were angry about\n\nthe \"half promise\" of an EU referendum and the time spent on legalising equal\n\nmarriage. Asked how long Cameron should have to make changes, Marsh said: \"I\n\nthink he has had long enough.\"\n\n\n\nSenior Tory MPs cautioned that Cameron should act with care as he responds to\n\nUkip. One MP said: \"I suspect the prime minister's head will tell him it is no\n\ngood chasing after Ukip, which is basically feeding crocodiles. If we could wave\n\na magic wand and put an EU referendum bill in the Queen's speech, would it have\n\na magical effect? I doubt it. We need to concentrate on bread-and-butter issues.\n\n\n\n\"It is entirely self-defeating to go after David Cameron. The Conservative party\n\noften veers between complacency and panic. Colleagues are in the process of\n\nabsorbing what has happened. There will no doubt be a lot of chatter behind the\n\nscenes over the weekend.\"\n\n\n\nTim Farron, the Lib Dem president, said the party had been \"obliterated\" in the\n\nSouth Shields byelection, where it came seventh. But the party said it performed\n\nwell in certain areas, such as Cheltenham, where it has MPs and a large number\n\nof councillors.\n\n\n\nNick Clegg said: \"It is not good to lose hardworking councillors, as we have\n\ndone in these elections. The Liberal Democrats are on a journey from a party of\n\nprotest to a party of government. Actually, the pattern that has emerged shows\n\nvery clearly that where we have MPs, where we have Liberal Democrats out on the\n\ndoorstep setting out our side to the story, we are holding our own and in some\n\nareas actually making gains.\"\n\n\n\nThe Lib Dems saw their vote fall on average by 12 points. John Curtice,\n\nprofessor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said the loss of just\n\n124 seats \"flattered to deceive\" because Lib Dems were mostly fighting Tories\n\nwhose vote share also fell.\n\n\n\nJonathan Freedland, page 43\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nJust about every American to have captured the White House since Nixon has\n\nstyled themselves as an outsider, riding into Washington to shake up a\n\ndiscredited elite. Neither governing for the 1% nor even being the son of a\n\nformer president precluded this distinctive rhetoric, which has never gripped\n\nBritain in the quite same way. Yesterday, however, Nigel Farage led Ukip on a\n\nproudly upstart charge into the county halls of shire England. The BBC's\n\nprojected national vote shares implied that the political category we used to\n\ndismiss as \"others\" - that is, Ukip plus the rest of the political fringe - was\n\ntop of the poll, while all three of the so-called major parties turned in dismal\n\nscores.\n\n\n\nA great deal separates Ukip's Little England nationalism from folksy American\n\nposturing, but exactly as in the US it is as well to ask what lies behind the\n\nrebellious talk. A man who gasps to defy the busybodies who prevent him from\n\nsparking up in the pub, Mr Farage is the right man to sound the call for a\n\nrabble army. But it is as well to recall that Ukip's incoherent policy platform\n\nmixes fear-mongering about immigration with flat tax that would redistribute to\n\nthe rich, and that its avowed love of freedom does not extend to gay people who\n\nwant to get married. Neither Ukip policy nor its occasionally unsavoury\n\npersonnel are subjected to the same sort of scrutiny as the more established\n\ntribes. Most of the hundreds of thousands who trooped to the ballot box to put a\n\ncross next their local Ukip candidate were clearer about what they were voting\n\nagainst than what they were voting for - and therein lies the dismal message for\n\nthe rest of the political pack.\n\n\n\nThe Labour party came out least bruised, outpolling the Tories where it mattered\n\n- in those urban enclaves within the shires, from Lincoln to Harlow, which will\n\ndetermine the outcome in 2015. To point this out is fair enough, but - in its\n\nheart - Labour must also know that it is still not good enough for this stage of\n\nthe game. The party slightly undershot a mid-term poll rating which is already\n\ntoo modest to make victory assured, and above all it failed to do what thriving\n\noppositions do and become the natural home for the great bulk of malcontents.\n\n\n\nFor the Conservatives, the bad news is less qualified. The direct upshot of\n\nUkip's surge, which draws disproportionately from Tory support, was the loss of\n\na worse-than-expected 335 seats, and a few previously true blue counties such as\n\nLincolnshire and Norfolk. The destabilising dynamics, which are the indirect\n\nconsequence, are even worse news for David Cameron. He will face enormous\n\npressure from that element in his party that hankers for a Ukip-style Tory\n\nparty. No matter the gamble he made at the start of the year - to counter the\n\nUkip threat with the promise of a EU referendum - is now a gamble that he has\n\ndemonstrably lost. \"Double or nothing\" will be the cry from the right, and\n\nunless Mr Cameron can muster more strength than he has recently shown, he could\n\njeopardise the future of his coalition with the Liberal Democrats. His one\n\ncomfort is that his partners' (these days almost routinely) dismal performance\n\nwill frighten them off walking away and triggering an early election.\n\n\n\nThe Lib Dems imagine themselves as having nothing in common with Ukip, and in\n\npolicy terms that is true. Before they entered government, however, their vote\n\nwas similarly swelled by that element in the electorate more interested in\n\nflipping the thumbs down at the agenda of those in power, than in endorsing any\n\nparticular alternative plan. As the slump leaves the establishment parties\n\noffering different flavours of pain, the \"none of the above\" contingent is\n\ngrowing. In the end, the substance of that will have to be addressed. In the\n\nmeantime, all three parties would do well to do away with alien and\n\ninfuriatingly upbeat talk of \"aspiration\", and engage with the grumpy tone of a\n\nnation that is thoroughly fed up at finding that its pay packet is buying less\n\neach year.\n\n\n\n",

William Hague echoed\n\nremarks over the weekend by Kenneth Clarke who dismissed the party as a\n\n\"collection of clowns\", when he said the party had a \"clown-like aspect\". The\n\nprime minister, by contrast, declined to criticise Ukip and would not even use\n\nits name in a BBC interview.\n\n\n\nNigel Farage, the Ukip leader, joked that the Tory insults had helped his party.\n\nFarage told ITV News: \"Keep the abuse coming, boys, keep it coming. Ken Clarke\n\nhad a go at the weekend and we went up by 2% in the opinion polls afterwards. So\n\nplease keep abusing us, because when you abuse us what you are doing is you are\n\nabusing the vast majority of the British public who want us to be a free\n\nindependent country that controls its own borders.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister used his final interview ahead of the local elections to\n\nreach out to voters tempted by Ukip when he indicated that he may be prepared to\n\nthrow the weight of the 304 Tory MPs behind placing a referendum on the statute\n\nbook before the next election.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister is facing strong pressure from the Tory right to face down\n\nthe Liberal Democrats, who would oppose any legislation for a referendum in this\n\nparliament. John Baron, the MP for Basildon and Billericay, has won the support\n\nof 100 Tory MPs for a letter calling on the prime minister to bring forward\n\nenabling legislation for a referendum.\n\n\n\nCameron told The World at One on Radio 4: \"I think we need to demonstrate\n\nabsolutely that we are serious about this referendum. We have said we are going\n\nto hold it. It is going to be an in/out referendum. We have set a date by which\n\nit must be held. Anything we can do to strengthen that offer I am prepared to\n\nconsider.\"\n\n\n\nDowning Street sources acknowledged that the prime minister would not be able to\n\nintroduce any government legislation in the face of Lib Dem opposition. But they\n\nindicated that Cameron may be prepared to support moves by backbenchers.\n\n\n\nBaron, who warned the prime minister earlier this week that Ukip voters had\n\n\"genuine concerns\" about the EU, gave a guarded welcome to the prime minister's\n\nremarks. The MP, who is annoyed that Downing Street has failed to arrange a\n\nmeeting for him with the prime minister, said the Tory leadership would have to\n\nagree to support a bill and not offer support for a non-binding vote.\n\n\n\nBaron says the new session of parliament, which opens on 8 May, offers the\n\nchance when a ballot for private members' bill will be held. If an MP who comes\n\nnear the top of the ballot supported a referendum bill it would have a strong\n\nchance if the Tory leadership lent its support.\n\n\n\nBaron said: \"Our commitment to a referendum must be both credible and\n\nbelievable. It's credible because we have the out option now. But it is not yet\n\nbelievable because there is a deep public mistrust out there when people hear\n\npoliticians making promises about EU referenda. They have heard too many before\n\nand too many have been broken.\n\n\n\n\"What would make it more believable is a serious attempt to get legislation\n\nthrough in this parliament. Whether successful or not it really would show good\n\nintent and would be more believable than a general election manifesto promise.\n\nIt would be in law.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister also reiterated his remarks during his trip to India in\n\nFebruary that aid spending could be diverted to peacekeeping. He told the BBC:\n\n\"There are rules for what you can use the aid budget for and it is right we obey\n\nthose rules. But I also think it is right we ask the question about what does\n\ndevelopment actually consist of.\"\n\n\n\nThe Tories are defending nearly two-thirds (1,477) of the 2,362 seats up for\n\ngrabs. They expect heavy losses as they defend seats captured when they were at\n\na polling high in 2009, and are nervous they will be squeezed by the anti-EU\n\nUkip.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\nThe number of lost seats the Tories are bracing themselves for, having been at a\n\nhigh when the same seats were last contested\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mood in the Conservative party on Thursday night will be determined at least\n\nas much by how well Ukip does in the local elections as by how badly the Tories\n\ndo. Losses to Labour in the hundreds are expected, given where the two parties\n\nstart these elections from. But it is the smaller number of seats that Ukip\n\nseems likely to win that will have a disproportionate impact on the Conservative\n\npsyche.\n\n\n\nMany in the party have for some time been preoccupied with how to combat the\n\nthreat of Ukip. But that preoccupation has become an obsession since David\n\nCameron's promise of an \"in-out\" referendum on Europe failed to dent Ukip's\n\nappeal. A strong Ukip candidate and a campaign that denied the Conservatives a\n\nmorale-boosting gain in the Eastleigh byelection added to the pressure. If Ukip\n\nadds sizeably to its number of county councillors on Thursday, it will do more\n\nthan rub salt in Tory wounds; it will start another round of soul-searching over\n\nwhat to do about Ukip.\n\n\n\nThe Tories should start by putting the challenge posed by the party into\n\nperspective. The Ukip challenge is not, first and foremost, a problem about\n\nEurope. As Michael Ashcroft pointed out earlier this week, if Nigel Farage's\n\nprimary aim really is to withdraw Britain from the EU, then taking votes away\n\nfrom the one party prepared to offer that option after the next election is a\n\nfunny way of achieving it. Polls show that it is not the Europe issue - or\n\nindeed any policies at all - that drive voters to Ukip.\n\n\n\nThe heart of the party's appeal is that it prefers life as it once was in\n\nBritain to what it is today. It is this emotional basis that makes dealing with\n\nUkip in government so difficult. The problem is that there is an irreducible\n\ncore of voters in Britain who simply regard as being beneath contempt the\n\ncompromises made by any administration as a result of the law, or international\n\nobligations or (for now) a coalition agreement.\n\n\n\nThese people have seen their lives and what they can expect for themselves and\n\ntheir families change for the worse in recent years. When Cameron talks about\n\nthe global race - the opportunities that lie ahead and the risks of being left\n\nbehind - these people look at their personal race, and fear it has already been\n\nrun. They feel they have been abandoned by all parties. It is no accident that\n\nUkip does disproportionately well among older, non-graduate, white men.\n\n\n\nThe ranks of these disaffected voters have been swelled not only by concerns\n\nover immigration and migration during the recession, but also by what they see\n\nas the failure of the political system to deal with everything from the row over\n\nMPs' expenses and the rise of the \"something for nothing society\" to the banking\n\ncrisis and flagrancy of bonus culture.\n\n\n\nCameron has to take note of these frustrations, but he also has to distinguish\n\nbetween those who are impatient with his lack of progress as prime minister and\n\nthose who are voting Ukip as a premeditated act to put themselves beyond the\n\nreach of mainstream politics.\n\n\n\nIn other words, he has to address those who are willing to take yes for an\n\nanswer and find practical ways of demonstrating how the future can be better and\n\nfairer, rather than get trapped into making empty promises about returning to a\n\npast which probably never existed.\n\n\n\nThe Tory strategy must be about pitching a big tent rather than trying to huddle\n\nfor warmth inside an ever smaller one; given the electoral arithmetic, Cameron\n\ndoesn't have the luxury of choosing between those who've defected to Ukip since\n\n2010 or pro-coalition voters who supported the Lib Dems at the last election.\n\n\n\nCameron needs both and more besides to win next time. That means offering a\n\nclear vision of what Britain will look like when it emerges from austerity, who\n\nhe wants to see sharing in what he used to call the \"proceeds of growth\" and\n\nreassurance that the rewards of recovery will be shared fairly. Above all, he\n\nhas to stick to his guns, particularly after nights like tomorrow. To stand any\n\nchance of winning in May 2015, Cameron has to make clear now that there can be\n\nno turning back.\n\n\n\nRick Nye is strategy director of Populus and a former director of the\n\nConservative Research Department\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIt takes a certain chutzpah for a relatively new MP to stand their ground on a\n\npublic platform with Peter Mandelson and to make the former business secretary\n\nlook slightly out of touch.\n\n\n\nBut that is exactly what Jo Johnson did when he dismissed an attempt by\n\nMandelson to goad him into criticising David Cameron's plans to hold a\n\nreferendum on EU membership.\n\n\n\nJohnson, announced as the new Downing Street policy chief on Wednesday night,\n\nsat calmly at a recent Policy Network conference at the Guildhall and never\n\nraised his voice as he told Mandelson repeatedly that the \"referendum genie\" was\n\nnow out of the bottle and would never return.\n\n\n\nMandelson thought Johnson, one of the most pro-European Tory MPs of the 2010\n\nintake, would echo the widespread criticisms of the prime minister's pledge to\n\nhold an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership.\n\n\n\nJohnson, 41, is certainly cut from a different political cloth from the vast\n\nmajority of Eurosceptic Tories, including his older brother Boris. But the first\n\nmember of the Johnson family to secure a perch in Downing Street is a\n\nsophisticated operator who is too canny to fall into a trap set by Mandelson.\n\n\n\nThe exchanges with one of the founders of New Labour highlight the area that\n\nprompted many Tories to raise their eyebrows at Johnson's appointment. One Tory\n\nsaid: \"Jo Johnson has a cool intellect and is very civilised. But he is very\n\nleftwing. He is very pro-European.\"\n\n\n\nEven members of the shadow cabinet were surprised. One said: \"When you talk to\n\nJo Johnson it sounds like he should be in the Labour party.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister is fully aware of Johnson's background, not least because\n\nthey share a great deal in common. Both attended Eton, though not at the same\n\ntime, and both were members of the Bullingdon club at Oxford. Johnson was a\n\nmember at the same time as his Oxford contemporary George Osborne, and looked\n\nmore self-possessed than the future chancellor in their famous Bullingdon group\n\nphotograph.\n\n\n\nJohnson, who is particularly close to his older sister Rachel, is a strong\n\nsupporter of his more famous older brother. While they share the same\n\nbrainpower, they are contrasting characters. Johnson minimus - he is the\n\nyoungest of three brothers - appears not to have an ostentatious bone in his\n\nbody. They both married women who do not exactly hail from the Tory tribe:\n\nBoris's wife, Marina, is a human rights lawer; Jo's wife, Amelia Gentleman, is\n\nan award-winning Guardian writer on poverty.\n\n\n\nCameron has appointed Johnson because he admires the razor-sharp intellect of\n\nthe Balliol scholar who took a first in history. The most significant factor in\n\nJohnson's favour is that he understands the challenge posed to European\n\ncountries by the emerging economies of India and China. Johnson, who served as\n\nthe Financial Times's bureau chief in Delhi, accompanied the prime minister on\n\nhis first overseas trade mission to India, in July 2010.\n\n\n\nJohnson's writings on how to ensure Britain survives in such a competitive world\n\nprovide a mine for Tory critics of Cameron. The pro-European Business for New\n\nEurope group, regarded with great suspicion by many Tories, provided Johnson\n\nwith Â£1,750 in travel and accommodation costs last April to help him research an\n\nessay on improving links between Britain and India.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nPolicy chief Jo Johnson has been described as canny operator who would not look\n\nout of place in the Labour party\n\n\n\n",

Possibly whoever it was imagined the PM was at last contemplating Plan\n\nBee. It was the only lightish moment in a dire prime minister's questions. Oh,\n\nDavid Amess had a query about his 101-year-old mother wanting Cameron to bring\n\nthe EU referendum forward so she could vote. But that's the kind of gag that\n\namuses MPs and very few others.\n\n\n\nHow did Ed Miliband get things so wrong? It was the first PMQs for five weeks -\n\nthanks to a long Easter holiday and Margaret Thatcher's funeral - and last time\n\nthe Labour leader had easily worsted the PM. Cameron certainly looked nervous.\n\nThe bald patch, slightly larger than before, was alarmingly low on the scalp.\n\nAnd when Huw Irranca-Davies (Lab, Ogmore) asked if his dabs were all over the\n\nrejection of Tanni Grey-Thompson to the chair of Sport England (as a disabled\n\nperson, she has had the naked effrontery to criticise the government's attitude\n\nto disability benefits) his face went red, which is never a good sign.\n\n\n\nSo we were expecting a tremendous fight, Frasier v Ali, perhaps, or even Suarez\n\nv Ivanovic, with both sides chewing lumps out of each other.\n\n\n\nAnd there was plenty for Miliband to sink his fangs into. Another ratings agency\n\nmarks us lower than France: France, the Italy of northern Europe! Borrowing\n\nalmost imperceptibly down. Unemployment - the one proud claim the coalition\n\ncould make - back up again. And if we avoid the triple dip today, that doesn't\n\nmean it ain't coming. Cameron should have been punch drunk, tottering round the\n\nring, his brain rattling round in his skull.\n\n\n\nIn fact we got the usual tedious exchange of pointless figures. Miliband had\n\ndecided to devote all his six questions to the NHS, which might play well with\n\nfocus groups, but only leads into a quagmire or meaningless claims,\n\ncounterclaims and dodgy figures. And there are so many statistics attached to\n\nthe NHS that either side can prove anything. Twelve-hour waits in A&E, said\n\nMiliband. A&E targets breached only 15 times, said Cameron.\n\n\n\nMiliband fought back with numbers conjured from - where? He hit out with\n\n888,000. Cameron fought back with Â£3bn. Miliband talked about \"one in 10\n\nhospitals\" without adequate staff; Cameron countered with 6,000 more doctors\n\n(without actually mentioning that these had been recruited for training under\n\nLabour). He also, as Miliband must have realised, could quote reams about the\n\nNHS in Wales, run by Labour.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't a snarling, bruising, wrestling bout, but more like one conducted with\n\nthose giant cotton buds they used to use on the old Gladiators show. Except that\n\nat least those knocked people down.\n\n\n\nImmediately afterwards we heard Theresa May talk about the latest setback in her\n\nattempt to deport Abu Qatada. This has become an obsession. If I were David\n\nCameron, I would say: \"Calm down, dear, you have too much on your plate already.\n\nAnd he is in jail! He can't do any harm to anyone! Chill!\"\n\n\n\n",

It\n\nwould weaken Nato, it would weaken the British influence within Nato. I think\n\nfrom a military point of view the disadvantages for Great Britain would be\n\nbigger than the advantages.\"\n\n\n\nDe Maiziere said he knew he was intervening in a domestic debate, but argued it\n\nwas too important to stand to one side, particularly with the potential military\n\nconsequences for the UK's standing in the world.\n\n\n\n\"I am not talking about economic issues or social issues, or whether you drive\n\non the left or the right side of the road, I am talking about security. I am\n\ntalking about British influence beyond its own borders. I think it is part of\n\nthe British tradition that Britain has to play a role in the world. Outside the\n\nEU it would not lose a role, but it would reduce their own influence and this\n\ncannot be in the interests of Great Britain.\n\n\n\n\"We in Germany would lose a strong partner for a pro-Atlantic co-operation with\n\nAmerica and a pragmatic British way to deal with security issues.\"\n\n\n\nUnder pressure from Eurosceptics in his own party, and with Ukip support\n\ngrowing, Cameron has promised a simple in-out referendum on membership of the EU\n\nif the Conservatives win the next election.\n\n\n\nDuring the announcement in January, the prime minister warned that\n\ndisillusionment with the EU was at an \"all-time high\", and said he wanted to\n\nrenegotiate Britain's role in the EU before he could pledge his support for\n\nstaying in. Germany and France have said the UK cannot cherrypick its\n\nmembership, and De Maiziere made it clear that Berlin needed strong UK support\n\nwithin the EU to counter French hopes of weakening Nato at the expense of\n\nBrussels.\n\n\n\n\"France has asked us to take more lead within the EU on defence. France is not\n\nin favour of a stronger role for Nato. The UK is just the opposite,\" he said.\n\n\n\nGermany has also been irked by public demands from the UK and the US for Berlin\n\nto spend more money on its military, to bolster Nato's defences at a time when\n\nWashington has made Asia its priority.\n\n\n\nDe Maiziere, 59, made it clear he was not minded to take advice from countries\n\nthat were cutting their defence budgets; the UK slashed defence spending by 8%\n\nin the 2010 strategic defence and security review (SDSR), which led to 60,000\n\ncivilian and military job losses, and the loss of equipment such as the aircraft\n\ncarrier Ark Royal and the entire fleet of Harrier jump jets.\n\n\n\n\"For the last five years, the German defence budget has been quite stable.\n\nNearly no reduction, and in the future it will remain stable. This is nearly\n\nunique in Europe,\" he said. \"Of the bigger countries, only Poland is in a\n\nsimilar position. I see reductions in Great Britain and France. I am not\n\ncriticising that. There are good reasons for that. But if we keep the line, and\n\nthey don't, I would like to learn the (reasons why) you hear sometimes we should\n\nhave more commitments than they themselves. I am speaking frankly.\"\n\n\n\nDe Maiziere said other European countries looked to Germany to take a lead in\n\neconomic and military matters, but then balked at the way Berlin wanted to do\n\nthings. \"In the euro (banking) crisis, when some countries call for German\n\nleadership, they mean Germany should pay more. They criticise us when we say\n\nleadership means we, Europe, shouldn't spend so much raising debts. But when we\n\nsay this, they say this perhaps is not good leadership. You can't have the cake\n\nand eat it. When the leader only fulfils the wishes of the others, that is not\n\nleadership.\"\n\n\n\nHe made clear that Germany had been urging Nato to adopt a counter-insurgency\n\nstrategy in Afghanistan long before it was finally adopted, but had been sneered\n\nat for suggesting the military approach could not work on its own.\n\n\n\nEU crime opt-out 'puts Britain's security at risk', page 8\n\n\n\n",

The hearse carrying her coffin, draped in white\n\nflowers and the union flag, glided past the regular knot of protesters on\n\nParliament Square, past the silent sightseers outside the abbey and into the\n\nPeers' entrance at 2.58pm. The Methodist disciplinarian, never quite erased from\n\nher character, would have approved.\n\n\n\nJust before the cortege turned up, three ministers - Vince Cable, David Willetts\n\nand Matt Hancock - dashed through the crowd into the building. Overwhelmed with\n\ngrief? Not exactly. They were voting to fend off a backbench Tory revolt against\n\nthe coalition's relaxation of home extension planning laws, a recipe for\n\nsuburban anarchy which might have tested her party loyalty.\n\n\n\nThough modest, yesterday's was a showier appearance than Thatcher's debut here,\n\nmade after winning Finchley in the Tory election landslide of October 1959. But\n\nnot by much. Even then the former Miss Roberts, a wannabe MP since her teens,\n\nhad shown a talent for publicity and a capacity to impress despite the handicap\n\nof her gender - one of just 25 \"lady members\" that year, 12 of them Tories.\n\n\n\n\"Tories Choose Beauty,\" the Evening Standard said when the tax barrister\n\nmother-of-twins had beaten the chaps to a safe London seat, despite her husband\n\nbeing away on business. Finchley Tories \"have armed themselves with a new weapon\n\n- a clever woman,\" said the more perceptive Finchley Press.\n\n\n\nWithin weeks of becoming an MP pundits were predicting \"a brilliant future\". \"A\n\nstar is born,\" said the Express. The future PM's Labour pair called her\n\n\"exceptionally able, also a very nice woman\". One patronising Tory MP called her\n\n\"over-bright and shiny\", another said that she reminded him of one of his\n\nconstituency activists \"but writ hideously large\".\n\n\n\nHow things change. In 1959 Thatcher's evolving Thatcherite views were distinctly\n\nunfashionable in Harold Macmillan's Keynesian Britain and she was smart enough\n\nto keep them in her handbag. As for some of the rightwing Tories - not all - who\n\nturned out for yesterday's short, simple service in the ancient Chapel of St\n\nMary Undercroft, they would have been among her most vocal (\"should be at home\n\nwith her children\") critics in the blokeish Smoking Room.\n\n\n\nFew visitors seemed to be aware of the quiet drama in the chapel off Westminster\n\nHall where Charles I was tried for his life in 1649. As for the school parties,\n\nhow many of them had tweeted last week \"who is Margaret Thatcher?\" A Roundhead\n\nin the Cavalier's party is one answer.\n\n\n\nEileen Wright, 82 and a parliamentary secretary since 1946 - yes 1946 - was not\n\nin the crowd by chance. In the early years she used to fill in during Thatcher's\n\nown secretary's holidays. \"She was lovely. One Monday I said 'I can't stay late\n\ntonight, I have my floral art class.' The next Monday she said 'it's your floral\n\nart class.'

I think the business community is\n\nsmart enough to realise that just having a trade union is not enough,\" she said.\n\n\"They are smart enough to know they need to be part of a union that has\n\npolitical and financial power.\"\n\n\n\nIn January, David Cameron announced that if the Conservatives won the next\n\nelection, they would hold an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU\n\nbefore the end of 2017.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister also said that before that he would be seeking a new\n\nsettlement between the UK and Brussels, through a full treaty renegotiation or\n\nother means, to repatriate powers to Britain, and that he wants the EU to\n\nabandon its commitment to \"ever closer union\".\n\n\n\nScardino made the comments on the EU referendum during a question and answer\n\nsession after delivering the 2013 Hugo Young lecture in London on Tuesday\n\nevening.\n\n\n\nIn her speech, she said she thought Young, the pro-European former Guardian\n\npolitical columnist who died in 2003, would \"likely have scolded the government\n\nfor pandering to Ukip\".\n\n\n\nScardino, who was born and raised in Texas but has lived in the UK for 20 years,\n\nalso said the EU was in need of leaders of the stature of George Washington and\n\nAbraham Lincoln to help it through its current political and financial malaise.\n\n\n\nIn a speech that drew comparisons between the EU and the development of the US\n\nas a political union over more than two centuries, she added that having a\n\nsingle, strong leader was one of the factors that had helped her native country\n\nsurvive numerous political crises that could have torn it apart, including the\n\ncivil war.\n\n\n\nAnswering a question on this point, Scardino said she thought there was a \"such\n\na paucity of imagination among politicians and business leaders\" responsible for\n\nmaking decisions about the EU's political and financial future.\n\n\n\n\"If you don't have anyone brave enough to say, 'We've got to have something to\n\nbind ourselves together,' you are never going to have (a sense of union like the\n\nUS has),\" she added. \"The politics of Europe is unimaginative and bureaucratic.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, Scardino said another lesson from the history of the US was that\n\nbuilding a union between disparate groups of people takes time, above all else.\n\n\n\nShe added that the US grew from 13 British colonies that shared a common\n\nlanguage and culture, where as the EU was trying to forge closer union from\n\ncountries that in some cases had been in existence for more than 1,000 years,\n\nwith \"very, very long histories and very well-dug-in legacies\".\n\n\n\n\"It's not about legislatures being more compromising; it's not about anything\n\nother than time. It takes a long time to build democracy, to build freedom.\"\n\n\n\nThe annual Hugo Young lecture is organised by the Scott Trust, the owner of the\n\nGuardian.\n\n\n\n",

The hearse carrying her coffin, draped in white\n\nflowers and the union flag, glided past the regular knot of protesters on\n\nParliament Square, past the silent sightseers outside the abbey and into the\n\nPeers' entrance at 2.58pm. The Methodist disciplinarian, never quite erased from\n\nher character, would have approved.\n\n\n\nJust before the cortege turned up, three ministers - Vince Cable, David Willetts\n\nand Matt Hancock - dashed through the crowd into the building.

Finchley Tories \"have armed themselves with a new weapon\n\n- a clever woman,\" said the more perceptive Finchley Press.\n\n\n\nWithin weeks of becoming an MP pundits were predicting \"a brilliant future\". \"A\n\nstar is born,\" said the Express. The future PM's Labour pair called her\n\n\"exceptionally able, also a very nice woman\".

In a joint interview with European newspapers earlier in the week, he\n\nsaid his proposals were a benefit to the EU as a whole. \"What I want to do is\n\nachieve a reform of the European Union,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"We're in a global race where we have to compete with (countries such as) India,\n\nChina, Indonesia and Malaysia. We need a Europe that is more open, that is more\n\ncompetitive, that is more flexible, that thinks more about the cost that it's\n\nputting on businesses, particularly small businesses. That is the aim.\"\n\n\n\nLeadsom, who was been canvassing support in other EU states for the Fresh Start\n\nproposals, said yesterday that Tory Eurosceptics accepted that compromise would\n\nbe necessary as talks about the future of Europe get under way.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think anybody on the backbenches or the frontbenches of any party\n\nthinks laying down the law is at all possible or plausible or desirable,\" she\n\nsaid.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nDavid and Samantha Cameron visit the country home of Angela Merkel\n\n\n\n",

Merkel and Francois Hollande, the French president who\n\nwill host the prime minister at the Elysee Palace in Paris tonight, showed their\n\nunease with Cameron recently by boycotting a British exercise to assess the\n\nimpact of EU laws across Europe.\n\n\n\nAs he prepared to travel to Spain and France, the prime minister reached out to\n\nhis European critics by saying he was not looking for favourable British\n\ntreatment when he outlined plans to hold an in-out referendum. In an interview\n\nwith journalists from five EU member states - including Suddeutsche Zeitung and\n\nLe Monde - he said he hopes his proposed reforms, including changes to the\n\nworking time directive, would apply to all member states.\n\n\n\nAsked which policies he would like to repatriate, Cameron said: \"I don't want to\n\ngive you a shopping list. I think this should be a discussion across Europe\n\nabout how we make the EU more flexible, and how we make clear that powers can\n\nflow back to nation states as well as flow forward to the EU. So I don't want to\n\nput a list of powers; I think it's more important to (ensure) the principles . .\n\n. that people talked about in the past, are more clearly established.\"\n\n\n\nHe said other EU leaders might benefit from some of his changes as a way to\n\ntackle unease with the EU across Europe.\n\n\n\nHis remarks were designed to address the impression that he would like to use a\n\nrevision of the Lisbon treaty to repatriate powers. Aides point out that the\n\nword repatriation does not appear in his speech. His interview was intended to\n\nflag up a passage in the speech where he calls for EU leaders to implement the\n\nLaeken Declaration of 2001 which was designed to create greater transparency and\n\ndemocracy in the EU. The prime minister said in that Britain would demand the\n\nchanges for itself if they were rejected by other member states.\n\n\n\nCameron repeats his warning that it is important to respond to falling support\n\nfor the EU in Britain. \"We need to recognise that consent for Britain's\n\nmembership of the EU and all the ways that it's changed has become wafer-thin in\n\nBritain.\"\n\n\n\nCameron will find common ground with Hollande today, making clear Britain will\n\ncall for the EU arms embargo to be amended, allowing weapons to the Syrian\n\nopposition. Germany is a supporter of the embargo.\n\n\n\n",

The letters, dubbed\n\nquestionnaires in Paris and Berlin, were sent after William Hague, the foreign\n\nsecretary, launched the review last July.\n\n\n\nBut France and Germany have decided to steer clear of the review because they\n\nsee it as driven by British politics. A French diplomat said: \"This is a British\n\ndomestic political exercise. We have therefore decided we would not\n\nparticipate.\"\n\n\n\nOnly a few EU countries have replied to the letters. These include Italy, run\n\nuntil recently by Mario Monti's technocratic government, and Sweden, whose\n\ncentre-right prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, is Cameron's closest ally in the\n\nEU.\n\n\n\nThe boycott by France and Germany, which went to the trouble of co-ordinating\n\ntheir positions at senior levels, will disappoint Cameron, who set great store\n\nby Merkel's guarded welcome to his speech.\n\n\n\nBerlin's decision to ignore the British review follows a clear private warning\n\nfrom Merkel that, if re-elected in September, she would grant little of\n\nsubstance to Cameron in his demands for a renegotiation of the terms of\n\nBritain's EU membership before the UK's referendum, which the prime minister has\n\nsaid would be held by 2017 at the latest. Hollande has been publicly dismissive\n\nof Cameron's speech.\n\n\n\nThe Tories plan to use the review to decide on which areas to renegotiate.\n\nCameron said in January: \"Our balance of competences review (will) give us an\n\ninformed and objective analysis of where the EU helps and where it hampers.\"\n\n\n\nWhitehall sources are putting a brave face on the snub. One senior figure said:\n\n\"It is shrug your shoulders time. We are not put-out.\"\n\n\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"This is intended to be an open and transparent\n\nprocess so of course we have invited other EU countries to contribute, and\n\nindeed several have along with a number of international organisations, but we\n\nrecognise others consider this an essentially domestic review and have decided\n\nnot to.\"\n\n\n\nThe Franco-German decision shows how Britain has become isolated in Europe. The\n\nforeign secretary had high hopes of co-operation from across the EU for his\n\nreview when he launched the exercise in a statement to MPs. Hague said: \"The\n\nreview will be an outward-facing exercise, both domestically and\n\ninternationally.\"\n\n\n\nThe boycott will disappoint ministers because British diplomats across the EU\n\nhave gone out of their way to stress that the exercise will be even-handed.\n\nCivil servants will submit reports to a three-strong ministerial team chaired by\n\nDavid Lidington, the Europe minister, which also includes Mark Hoban, the work\n\nand pensions minister, and Lord Wallace of Saltaire, the Liberal Democrat whip\n\nand European affairs academic who is the party's representative in the Foreign\n\nOffice.\n\n\n\nThe ministers are due to receive the drafts of the first six reports within\n\nweeks. These cover the internal market, foreign policy, development and aid,\n\ntaxation, health, animal welfare and food safety.\n\n\n\nThe senior Whitehall source said: \"The letters explained our approach and said\n\nwe would welcome contributions.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nA leading human rights lawyer spends eight days in jail; the prime minister's\n\noffice is raided, six of his staff arrested and three computers allegedly go\n\nmissing; civil society groups warn of rising political violence and intimidation\n\ntactics. Plus ca change in Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\nYet thousands of miles away that is not, apparently, how things look from\n\nBrussels. On Monday the European Union dropped most of its sanctions against the\n\nsouthern African country, the most far-reaching olive branch for more than a\n\ndecade.\n\n\n\nThis was in effect a reward for a \"peaceful, successful and credible\" referendum\n\non a new constitution and designed to encourage further progress. The EU dropped\n\nits targeted measures against 81 officials and eight firms in Zimbabwe. Only 10\n\npeople, including President Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace, and two companies,\n\nincluding the state-run Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC), remain\n\non the sanctions list, restricted by asset freezes and travel bans.\n\n\n\nThe move comes after years of declining political violence and slow economic\n\nrecovery under a power-sharing agreement that followed the violently disputed\n\n2008 election. Since then, with the world's gaze diverted by the Arab spring and\n\nAfrican coups, Zimbabwe has dropped down the list of crises requiring urgent\n\nattention and begun to woo tourists again. Now the incident-free referendum and\n\neasing of sanctions appears to put the seal on the notion that the country has\n\nmore or less \"normalised\".\n\n\n\nYet the unfortunate coincidence of the referendum with the arrest of lawyer\n\nBeatrice Mtetwa, finally released on Monday, and six members of prime minister\n\nMorgan Tsvangirai's staff, suggests that in Zimbabwe \"normal\" is still a long\n\nway from ordinary. Mtetwa warned: \"It is a personal attack on all human rights\n\nlawyers but I was just made the first example. There will be many more arrests\n\nto follow as we near elections.\"\n\n\n\nHardliners in Mugabe's Zanu-PF party are accused of ongoing abuses. Four rights\n\nand advocacy groups have been raided by police searching for alleged subversive\n\nmaterials so far this year. Activist Okay Machisa was locked in police cells for\n\nalmost a month only for the charges to be dropped.\n\n\n\nAnalysts predict a rise in intimidation before elections this year. \"It looks\n\nsomewhat incongruous to lift sanctions in the context of some of the violations\n\nthat are continuing,\" said Piers Pigou, Southern Africa project director of the\n\nInternational Crisis Group. \"It's another episode of bad timing from the EU.\n\nThey said, 'If you have a good referendum process, we'll reward you'. They could\n\nhave put it in a broader context with qualifiers. They've been clumsy in the way\n\nthey've handled this.\"\n\n\n\nEmily Armistead, a lead campaigner on conflict diamonds at Global Witness, said:\n\n\"It's a relief that the EU has at least maintained sanctions against state-owned\n\ndiamond miner ZMDC. Our research shows the company is involved in off-budget\n\nfinancing of the army and secret police, organisations linked to violence and\n\nintimidation in previous elections. We remain concerned, though, that relaxing\n\nsanctions reflects the EU's keenness to see the Zimbabwe problem 'solved' before\n\nfree and fair elections have taken place, so that it can turn its attention\n\nelsewhere.\n\n\n\n\"Now is a critical time for EU governments to do all they can to support\n\nZimbabwe's full democratic transition.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, the relaxation of sanctions is welcome news to those who believe they\n\nhave long been counter-productive, gifting Mugabe an excuse for the country's\n\neconomic troubles and a rallying point to whip up anti-western sentiment. From\n\nthis perspective, Mugabe has just lost a major propaganda tool.\n\n\n\nDavid Coltart, the education minister and member of an MDC faction, said: \"My\n\nview is that sanctions have outlived their purpose and were being cynically\n\nmanipulated for political ends. Often we see that when sanctions are about to be\n\nlifted some appalling action is taken, which may help explain the arrest of\n\nBeatrice Mtetwa. It happens too often to be a coincidence.\"\n\n\n\nThe new constitution was endorsed by Zanu-PF and the MDC, so serious violence\n\nwas never likely during the referendum. The elections, which Mugabe wants in\n\nJune, are likely to be a different story. \"Although things have improved\n\ndramatically in the last four years, there are still terrible things happening\n\nin the country and there are still hardliners doing all they can to derail the\n\nprocess,\" warned Coltart.\n\n\n\nFew believe the elections will be as disastrous as in 2008 when some 253 people\n\ndied, according to an MDC count. The new constitution will be in place and\n\nZanu-PF is seen as less united. But its hardliners may have become more adept at\n\nusing intimidation without spilling blood. And it is still hard to imagine a\n\nscenario in which Mugabe, who has ruled for 33 years, accepts defeat and leaves\n\nthe stage gracefully. As Pigou noted: \"We are far from out of the woods.\"\n\n\n\n",

Yesterday the Russian\n\npresident, Vladimir Putin, said there would be a deal to rework the terms of a\n\neuros 2.5bn loan to the Mediterranean island, which had become attractive for\n\nits low tax regime and lax vetting laws.\n\n\n\nCyprus president Nicos Anastasiades made a televised address in which he\n\nadmitted that measures would be in place to stop money pouring out of the banks\n\nwhen they reopen. \"The central bank will implement capital controls on\n\ntransactions. I want to assure you that this will be a very temporary measure\n\nthat will gradually be relaxed,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMarkets were initially buoyed by news of the \"painful\" bailout for Cyprus,\n\nclinched late on Sunday night following threats by the European Central Bank to\n\nswitch off liquidity to Cypriot banks, which, carried by international deposits,\n\nhad grown to eight times the euros 17bn economy.\n\n\n\nBut markets reacted badly later in the day after Dijsselbloem's remarks. As\n\nmarkets tumbled, he issued a clarification insisting that bailout programmes\n\nwere \"tailor-made\" and that \"no models or templates are used\".\n\n\n\nNevertheless, all markets erased their early gains to close down on the day. The\n\nFTSE 100 index lost 0.2% and the German stock market fell 0.5%. Bank shares fell\n\nacross Europe while the euro, which had nudged up through $1.30 initially, fell\n\nback to below $1.29. US markets, which had largely shrugged off the Cypriot\n\nproblem, were also lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down over 70\n\npoints, 0.5%.\n\n\n\nCypriots had reacted to the agreement with European leaders with relief as it\n\nappeared that at least deposits below euros 100,000 had been spared the levy.\n\n\n\nIn the streets and cafes of Nicosia, and on TV chat shows, the feeling was that\n\nthe country had been saved but at a price.\n\n\n\nInterior minister Sokratis Hasiko encapsulated the mood, describing the EU\n\n-IMF-backed bailout as the best of a bad range of choices. \"We had got to the\n\npoint where we were discussing a (depositor) haircut of between 50 and 60%,\" he\n\nsaid, adding that the Cypriot parliament's rejection of the first accord, with\n\nits highly controversial levy on depositors big and small, had been hugely\n\nnegative for the country's banks. \"So this is the best we could get.\"\n\n\n\nThere were warnings the impact could reach beyond Cyprus, particularly with\n\nrepercussions from Russia, where the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said:\n\n\"They are continuing to steal what has already been stolen.\" This was a phrase\n\nLenin used to answer the allegation that the Bolsheviks were thieves. Russian\n\nofficials have repeatedly compared the Cypriot bank levy to Soviet-era\n\nexpropriation.\n\n\n\n\"For sure there is anger,\" said Marios Cosma, head of K Treppides, a firm that\n\nserves international clients, mainly rich Russians. \"For the first time in\n\nEurope, you have a situation where depositors are being called to 'bail in'.\"\n\n\n\nWhile Cyprus' banking sector has exploded, other countries have even larger\n\nbanking sectors relative to GDP. Malta's and Luxembourg's banking sectors are\n\nrelatively larger, more than 20 times' GDP in the case of Luxembourg. Malta's\n\nfinance minister wrote an article in the Malta Times expressing concern about\n\nwhat would happen if it encounters similar problems in the eurozone.\n\n\n\nIn Cyprus there were calls for a referendum on the bailout package. \"It is\n\nillegal and undemocratic,\" said Christos Tombazos, general secretary of the\n\nPancyprian Federation of Labour.\n\n\n\nThe Bank of Cyprus is 9.7% owned by Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian based in Monaco\n\nwhose wealth is estimated at $9.1bn according to Forbes.\n\n\n\nOne Russian oligarch, Alexander Lebedev, played down the amount he stood to lose\n\nin Cyprus as no more than $10,000. \"It's not worth talking about,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nReality check\n\n\n\nStudents take part in a parade for Greek independence day in Nicosia, yesterday.\n\nPoliticians described the bailout deal as a painful solution to avert imminent\n\nbankruptcy\n\n\n\nPhotograph: Petros Giannakouris/AP\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Osborne is being blamed by rightwing Conservatives for fuelling\n\nspeculation about the leadership ambitions of Theresa May as part of the\n\nchancellor's attempt to \"disable\" cabinet ministers who are fighting further\n\nspending cuts.\n\n\n\nAs backbenchers express increasing confidence that David Cameron will face a\n\nchallenge to his leadership later this summer, the home secretary will today set\n\nout her views at a conference organised by the ConservativeHome website.\n\n\n\nThe speech by May, who has been leading calls by cabinet ministers against\n\nfurther cuts to their budgets, follows a series of carefully calibrated\n\ninterventions to burnish her credentials on the right. Earlier in the week the\n\nDaily Mail reported that the home secretary was planning to impose a financial\n\nbond on some immigrants.\n\n\n\nOne senior Tory said: \"When you are halfway through a parliament there is a\n\nnatural tendency for people to start positioning themselves. I do not\n\nunderestimate the ambitions of Theresa May.\"\n\n\n\nBut a leading rightwinger detected the hand of the chancellor under pressure\n\nfrom the so-called national union of ministers. This group, led by the home\n\nsecretary with support from the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, is attempting\n\nto focus future spending cuts away from departments such as the Home Office and\n\nthe Ministry of Defence. The MP said: \"George is clearly encouraging speculation\n\nabout Theresa and Philip. It disables them.\"\n\n\n\nMay was thrust into the spotlight this week when Ed Miliband made light of her\n\napparent leadership ambitions during prime minister's questions when she sat\n\nnext to Hammond. The home secretary gave Miliband a thunderous look when he\n\nsaid: \"I am looking forward to facing her when they are in opposition.\"\n\n\n\nThe speculation has been prompted by a growing belief among some backbenchers,\n\nas the Guardian revealed last weekend, that the prime minister will face a vote\n\nof no confidence later in the summer if the chancellor fails to inspire\n\nconfidence in the budget and the Tories perform poorly in the local elections in\n\nMay.\n\n\n\nA vote will be triggered if 46 Tory MPs write to Graham Brady, the chairman of\n\nthe backbench 1922 committee. \"It is surprising how widely the unease is\n\nspreading,\" one MP said.\n\n\n\nAccording to today's Times, only seven percent of Conservative party members\n\nbelieve Cameron can win an outright majority at the next general election.\n\nQuoting an internal party poll the paper says three-quarters of party members\n\nbelieve Labour will be in power after the 2015 election.\n\n\n\nTory MPs have mixed thoughts about May. She is said to be modelling herself on\n\nJohn Major, who carefully and surreptitiously positioned himself to succeed\n\nMargaret Thatcher by reaching out to the right. One MP said: \"Theresa is clearly\n\nserious about it. But she is not a leader. She is a loner. She works very hard.\n\nShe is clearly a good home secretary. But she is not a leader.\"\n\n\n\nOne well-placed Tory was scornful of May's \"submarine\" strategy, in which she\n\nadopts a low media profile and surfaces at times of her own choosing. \"It's not\n\nmuch of a submarine strategy if we are all talking about it,\" the MP said. \"I\n\nthink Theresa's submarine must have a defective sonar.\" Another MP thought a\n\ntelltale sign was May's decision not to dampen speculation about her leadership\n\nintentions. The MP said: \"If Theresa thought all this was ridiculous she could\n\nsay it's all daft and there is no vacancy. But nobody in her team has done\n\nthat.\"\n\n\n\nOthers say the speculation about May has been prompted by the tactics of her\n\nparliamentary private secretary, George Hollingbery, who replaced Edward Timpson\n\nwhen he was appointed children's minister. Hollingbery, a millionaire who has\n\nput his north Cornwall cottage at the disposal of Cameron's family, has run a\n\nmore political operation for the home secretary.\n\n\n\n\"George has made a simple calculation,\" one MP said of Hollingbery, who is a\n\nmember of the executive of the 1922 committee. \"He knows that the job of a home\n\nsecretary involves permanently crossing a minefield where you never know if it\n\nis going to blow up in your face. She therefore needs to have good links with\n\nthe backbenches and will do herself no harm if she tacks to the right. George\n\nhas been instrumental in all of that because he is a little more worldly than\n\nEdward.\"\n\n\n\nAnother MP said: \"Is George plotting to ensure Theresa May is replacing David\n\nCameron? No, he is not. Is he thinking that his star could rise with Theresa's\n\nin the future? Of course he is.\"\n\n\n\nThe speculation about May comes as the Tory right plans to intensify the\n\npressure on No 10 by demanding that the prime minister issue an immediate\n\nchallenge to the Liberal Democrats on an early EU \"mandate\" referendum. This\n\nwould be an initial referendum to give the prime minister a mandate to negotiate\n\na change in the terms of Britain's membership of the EU. This would then be\n\nfollowed be a \"decision\" referendum.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nWestminster gossip suggests Theresa May has designs on Downing Street\n\n\n\n",

Home Office sources told the Daily Mail the bond would be aimed\n\nat \"high-risk\" individuals of \"two or three nationalities\".\n\n\n\nMinisters are joking about how May is \"on manoeuvres\" as she prepares to\n\nhighlight her leadership credentials this weekend in a long-awaited speech to a\n\nconference organised by the ConservativeHome website.\n\n\n\nHer strategy is being likened to that of Sir John Major as he positioned himself\n\nfor the leadership in 1990. May will follow Major's example in making no attempt\n\nto undermine the prime minister, but will be ready should a vacancy arise.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian reported at the weekend that rebel Tories were planning to write\n\nletters to Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, if George\n\nOsborne's budget on 20 March falls flat and if the Tories perform badly in May's\n\nlocal elections. If 46 Tory MPs write to Brady, Cameron will face a leadership\n\ncontest.\n\n\n\nMay looked highly unamused when Labour leader Ed Miliband made light of her\n\nambitions at prime minister's questions after he taunted Cameron for asking him\n\nquestions. \"All I can say is that it is good to see him preparing for\n\nopposition,\" Miliband said. Turning to May, he added: \"The home secretary shakes\n\nher head. I am looking forward to facing her when they are in opposition.\"\n\n\n\nMay is being compared to Major because he was not associated with any particular\n\nwing of the party, but was assiduous in courting the right, ensuring that he won\n\nthe support of Eurosceptics when Margaret Thatcher finally fell. The home\n\nsecretary has followed these tactics by regularly briefing rightwing newspapers\n\non her plans to distance Britain from the European Court of Human Rights. There\n\nis one major difference between now and 1990: Thatcher's position was weak and\n\nCameron's position is relatively strong, although a significant group on the\n\nright would like to replace him.\n\n\n\nThe speculation about May follows reports that Eurosceptic Tories are to step up\n\nthe pressure on Cameron by demanding that legislation to guarantee a referendum\n\non Britain's EU membership is passed before the election.\n\n\n\nToday's Times reported that an early referendum was discussed at a private\n\ndinner attended by Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, Liam Fox, the former\n\ndefence secretary, and David Davis, the former shadow home secretary.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nTheresa May's tactics have been compared to those adopted by Sir John Major\n\nbefore he became prime minister in 1990\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peasants are revolting across Europe. They want bankers' blood and mean to\n\nget it. Until now, public response to the credit crunch has been one of general\n\nbafflement and wrist-slapping. The banks persuaded the world it was all an act\n\nof fate. As it was, they were too big to fail and their leaders too saintly to\n\natone for it. For four years, British banks were showered with nearly half a\n\ntrillion pounds of public and printed money. They duly recovered and stayed\n\nrich, while everyone else went poor.\n\n\n\nThe worm has turned. The banks and government alike have failed to deliver\n\nrecovery. The people want revenge, and have found it - of all places - in the\n\nEuropean parliament. It has declared that EU bankers cannot get bonuses bigger\n\nthan their salaries, or twice as big if shareholders approve. This applies\n\nwherever EU bankers work, and to any overseas banker working in the EU.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a Swiss referendum now requires top executives to seek explicit\n\nshareholder approval for their pay, with a ban on golden hellos and goodbyes.\n\nThe Netherlands is talking of a tighter 20% cap on bonuses. Even laissez-faire\n\nBritain has seen the National Association of Pension Funds demand that boards\n\nkeep executive pay rises down to inflation.\n\n\n\nEurope's once omnipotent banking lobby has been all but neutered by the scale of\n\nscandal. The German government caved in to the EU parliament under pressure from\n\nthe opposition Social Democrats. This was after the Libor scandal revealed\n\nDeutsche Bank cutting one trader's bonus by Â£34m, thus implying a staggering\n\noriginal sum. The Swiss campaign was kicked into life by the drugs firm Novartis\n\ngiving its departing chairman a $76m gift. Some 68% of Swiss voted for the new\n\ncurb.\n\n\n\nOnly in Britain do ministers still dance to the bankers' tune. Last month RBS\n\nexecutives brushed aside their state shareholder and paid themselves Â£600m in\n\nbonuses after posting a Â£5bn loss. Loss-making Lloyds gave senior staff an extra\n\nÂ£365m. Money-laundering HSBC announced 78 of its London executives would take\n\nhome more than Â£1m each. They all say bonuses were unrelated to fines or losses,\n\nbut they always say that. George Osborne was humiliated in Brussels yesterday by\n\nhaving to plead their fruitless cause.\n\n\n\nLast year the City of London's much-heralded \"shareholder spring\" got nowhere.\n\nRevolts against executive pay at WPP, Barclays, Trinity Mirror and elsewhere had\n\nlittle noticeable impact. While overall pay stagnated, that of top executives\n\nrose 12%. Opinion polls showed the public overwhelmingly hostile to top pay.\n\nOnly the government and the London mayor stand between the very rich and a\n\nfurious public. The peasants' revolt means that even British ministers cannot\n\ndefy opinion for ever.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that the banking community has allowed this thirst for revenge to\n\nbuild up for over four years, and it just did not care. Ever since the 1980s and\n\nfinancial deregulation, the profession took home sums of money unheard of in any\n\nother line of work.\n\n\n\nThis had nothing to do with free markets, except within a tight group of\n\nhigh-rolling traders. Modern bankers derive \"economic rent\" from exploiting\n\noligopolistic cartels in financial services, with shareholders kept at one\n\nremove. The astronomical traders' bonuses are asymmetric returns on cash that\n\nproperly belongs to depositors and shareholders whose money bears the risk. In\n\nany other business such bonuses would be regarded as theft from the firm.\n\n\n\nFor four years the British government - Labour and the coalition - huffed and\n\npuffed but was too terrified of the banks to act. Regulators were suborned by\n\nlobbyists and ministers, their offices packed with seconded bankers, and did as\n\nthey were told. They gave huge sums to the banks in the belief that this was\n\nbenefiting the demand economy. In Britain, some Â£400bn of cash was \"pumped into\n\nthe economy\" via the banks. They merely traded or hoarded it, to their ever\n\ngreater enrichment. The money vanished. A thousand pounds handed to every\n\nBritish citizen would have had more impact on the economy.\n\n\n\nLast year, as if learning nothing, the Treasury gave the banks another Â£80bn to\n\nboost business and mortgage lending. This week it was predictably revealed that\n\nlending to small businesses actually fell as result. It was like giving money to\n\na drunk and telling him to support his children. Never in the history of money\n\ncan policy have been so glaringly inept. The banks laughed.\n\n\n\nNo trade unions are fiercer in defending their interests than the rich\n\nprofessions. As we saw this week with lawyers, cut their largesse and they\n\nthreaten to take it out on the poor, the economy, the government, everyone. The\n\nbanks howl that the bonus cap means their greed will go \"offshore\". This seems\n\nexaggerated. But the EU curbs could possibly see the start of the high-rollers\n\nmoving out of over-regulated Europe towards the Americas and Asia.\n\n\n\nThis would not be wholly good news for Britain: finance has been the boom\n\nindustry of the past quarter-century. But more likely is that the more toxic\n\nactivities will go, and that is no loss. Either way, the banks have themselves\n\nto blame. They flew their golden wings too near the sun, and rage has melted\n\nthem. They have only one plea on their side. The culture of greed in the City\n\nwas nothing to the culture of ineptitude at the Bank of England and the\n\nTreasury. They pumped out the money. Never in British economic history can so\n\nmuch have been so wasted on so fruitless a cause. And still no hint of remorse.\n\n\n\nsimon.jenkins@guardian.co.uk\n\n\n\n",

Germany had invariably supported Britain on\n\nissues of EU regulation of financial services.\n\n\n\nIt is also not yet clear if the bonus caps will apply to European bank\n\nsubsidiaries operating outside the EU or to US and other foreign banks based in\n\nLondon, Frankfurt and Paris.\n\n\n\nThe \"broad political support\" to clamp down on bankers represents a watershed in\n\nBritain's relations with the EU, which have seldom been in greater uncertainty\n\nas a result of David Cameron's actions in using a veto at an EU summit, when he\n\ndemanded an overhaul of the terms of UK membership and pledged a referendum on\n\nwhether to stay in the EU if he were to win a second term in 2015.\n\n\n\nMartin Schulz, the president of the parliament, acknowledged Britain's position\n\nbut said: \"An agreement has been reached on all aspects of the legislation.\n\nThere is no possible route for one member state to block the legislation. It\n\nwould appear that one state has severe difficulties with the agreement but the\n\nEU must press ahead and get this important legislation on the statute book.\"\n\n\n\nIn what looked like a move to give Osborne an opportunity to save some face,\n\nGermany suggested a slight postponement and slight adjustment of the new regime.\n\nThe timing and some of the fine detail of how the limits are implemented are to\n\nbe renegotiated over the next three weeks. But there was no doubt that the\n\ncentral decision, to clamp down on bonuses, was irreversible.\n\n\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the single market, said the year's\n\nsalary ceiling - or payouts equal to two years' salary only if approved by a\n\nlarge majority of a bank's shareholders - was set in stone. He said it was\n\n\"crystal clear\" that the cap would go ahead.\n\n\n\nBarnier rounded on the recklessness of the casino capitalism culture he blamed\n\nfor the financial crises of the past five years, arguing that bankers were being\n\nrewarded for dangerous risk-taking, while taxpayers had to foot the bills for\n\ntheir failures. \"Enough. It's over,\" he declared.\n\n\n\nThe new regime is to apply to 8,300 banks. Barnier wished \"good luck\" to those\n\nin London considering legal action to try to overturn the bonus ceilings. The\n\nnew legislation, he said, would be on \"a very solid legal basis.\"\n\n\n\nSession chairman, Michael Noonan of Ireland, said the meeting achieved \"broad\n\npolitical support\" for the limits on bankers' remuneration.\n\n\n\nOsborne came under attack from Labour for being too slow to try to counter the\n\nnew legislation and for failing to table alternative proposals over the past\n\ncouple of years. \"It shouldn't take the EU to rein in excessive bonuses,\" said\n\nEd Balls, the shadow chancellor.\n\n\n\nHe accused Osborne of \"failing to engage with these sensible proposals until the\n\nvery last minute. It's no wonder that in Brussels he was outnumbered 26 to 1\".\n\n\n\nOsborne had mounted a robust argument against the proposals, asserting the curbs\n\ncould have a \"perverse\" effect, generating steep rises in bankers' pay, breaking\n\nthe link between performance and bonuses, and making it more difficult to \"claw\n\nback\" bonuses when unmerited.\n\n\n\nWolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, offered a way to soothe the\n\nBritish, hoping to coax Osborne into not voting against the new rules, expected\n\nto come into force next year. \"There are a few technical issues still to be\n\nclarified,\" he said. \"Then I hope in the end the United Kingdom will agree.\"\n\n\n\nThe details still to be settled involve how the bonuses are structured, when\n\nthey are implemented, and who is subject to them. Under the existing proposal,\n\n25% of a bonus can be made in the form of deferred payments, which are\n\ndiscounted. Britain is trying to get that figure increased, perhaps to 30%.\n\nOsborne is also seeking to delay the measures taking effect and may win a\n\npostponement of between six and 12 months.Any changes will need to blessed by\n\nthe European parliament, which drove the new caps regime through.\n\n\n\nThe CBI said the bonus cap would hit the UK hard: \"The proposals will damage the\n\ncompetitiveness of the EU's financial services industry, hitting the UK\n\nparticularly hard at a time when growth should be the key priority.\" Britain's\n\npowerful financial sector fears the rules will put London at a disadvantage and\n\nprovoke an exodus of major banks and staff to rival financial centres. A\n\nspokesman for London-based Standard Chartered Bank said: \"We are concerned about\n\nit because we are a global bank and 97% of our staff are outside the EU. We are\n\nconcerned about our ability to be competitive in attracting talent.\"\n\n\n\n",

It also\n\nmarks a new emphasis on industrial policy.\n\n\n\nIt comes as George Osborne goes to Brussels today in what looks like a forlorn\n\nattempt to prevent the European Union from imposing severe curbs on bankers'\n\nbonuses in the City.\n\n\n\nIn a highly unusual defeat illustrating the UK's deepening isolation in Europe\n\nand the reluctance of EU partners to do Britain any more favours, finance\n\nministers of the other 26 are expected to endorse legislation to slash \"fat cat\"\n\nbonuses.\n\n\n\nThe decision to limit bonuses ordinarily to a year's salary was made last week\n\nat negotiations between the European parliament and officials from the 27 member\n\nstates. Despite David Cameron's opposition and Osborne's pledges to contest the\n\ndeal, it appears irreversible. The UK is unable to wield a veto as the decision\n\ncan go to a qualified majority vote if necessary.\n\n\n\nBritain has been unable to muster enough allies to block the proposal. Its\n\nlikeliest supporters, Sweden, the Netherlands and, crucially, Germany have all\n\ncome out in favour of capping bonuses.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, the Swiss voted in a referendum for even tighter controls on bank\n\npay, envisaging jail terms for those who break the new rules.\n\n\n\nThe Cox report suggests that the company governance code be altered so at least\n\n30% of executive director remuneration be paid in the form of shares that cannot\n\nbe cashed in for five years or until after the director has completed his or her\n\nperiod on the board.\n\n\n\nIt proposes a ban on voting rights for shareholders who appear on the register\n\nduring a takeover bid and says measures are needed to remove the tax bias that\n\nfavours companies funding loans through debt as opposed to equity.\n\n\n\nIn an effort to encourage so-called \"patient capital\" the report suggests\n\ncapital gains tax on shares could be tapered in a series of yearly steps from\n\n50% in year one to 10% after year 10. The report suggests the measure would be\n\nrevenue neutral.\n\n\n\nThe report also proposes that all major infrastructure investment, such as\n\nairport capacity, could be taken out of party politics so that responsibility is\n\nhanded to an independent agency that is accountable to parliament but\n\nindependent of MPs.\n\n\n\nMatthew Fell, director for competitive markets at business body CBI, said:\n\n\"There is a need to encourage a more long-term focus from investors and the\n\nreport's recognition that industrial strategy should be a cornerstone of policy\n\nis welcome.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nUkip's surge to 28% in Eastleigh, its best ever result in a byelection, leaves\n\nthe Conservatives scrambling to assess the root causes of Ukip's popularity and\n\nwhether its cheerful amateur leader Nigel Farage truly has the potential to\n\ndeprive the oldest political machine in British politics of as many as 40 seats\n\nin a general election.\n\n\n\nCameron's nightmare is that Ukip now owns the potent cocktail of EU-related\n\nissues, including migration and wage squeeze, and so can split the Eurosceptic\n\nright in 2015 - just as the SDP crippled Labour in the mid-80s. For the first\n\ntime in a century the Conservative party has lost monopoly control of the right.\n\n\n\nFarage is already promising to put up 2,000 candidates in the May county council\n\nelections. Ukip could well come first next year in the European parliament\n\nelections, which are run on a proportional system.\n\n\n\nSome Tories such as the former whip Michael Fabricant, in his leaked November\n\ndiscussion paper, urged Cameron to recognise that the real Ukip threat rests in\n\n\"stealing votes at general election rather than posing an actual threat to take\n\nany one seat\". He argued that Ukip started to split the right at the 2010\n\nelection. \"On a realistic estimate Ukip by standing and taking a mere 3-4% of\n\nthe vote, the Conservatives could lose 20 to 30 seats,\" Fabricant argued.\n\n\n\nHe pointed out: \"In the European elections in 2009 they became the second party,\n\novertaking Labour and gaining 13 seats and 16.5% of the vote. Fast forward a\n\nyear to the 2010 general election, and Ukip stood in 572 seats and took 3.1% of\n\nthe popular vote.\"\n\n\n\nYesterday Fabricant emphasised that the Conservative party now had to respond.\n\nIn a series of tweets he said: \"Everyone from the PM downwards must focus on the\n\neconomy, immigration, crime, Europe and not allow other side policies to\n\ndistract.\n\n\n\n\"Of course, liberal (small 'l') policies do not distract government from the\n\ncore issues, but they are seen to do so by the electorate. With Ukip clearly\n\nannouncing policies the public want to hear, we must do the same.\"\n\n\n\nUkip, as Eastleigh showed, has pretty well broken through. A longer campaign,\n\nand Ukip could have gatecrashed Westminster. Fabricant in his November paper\n\nsaid Cameron needed to respond to the Ukip threat by promising an EU referendum,\n\nand seeking an electoral pact with Farage. Cameron did promise the referendum,\n\nand put up a Eurosceptic candidate in Maria Hutchings - yet it gave no\n\nprotection from a Ukip surge.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the idea of a Ukip-Con pact was yesterday ruled out, not only by\n\nFarage but also by Michael Gove. Personal relations between Farage and Cameron\n\nare poisonous.\n\n\n\nSome say, \"Ukip is for people who would like to vote BNP, but shop at M&S.\" But\n\nthe polling work done by Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative vice-chairman,\n\nsuggests something more inchoate than racism, or even anti-Europeanism. In his\n\ninfluential study of Ukip voters titled They Are Thinking What We Are Thinking,\n\nhe said his research showed \"discussion amongst Ukip voters and considerers was\n\ndominated by what they saw as the twin themes of immigration and welfare, much\n\nmore than Europe.\n\n\n\n\"But many complained that migrants from within the EU and outside had changed\n\nthe character of their local area beyond recognition. Recession and austerity\n\nbrought their complaints into sharper focus .\" He went on: \"They do not think\n\nmainstream politicians are willing or able to keep their promises or change\n\nthings for the better. Ukip, with its single unifying theory of what is wrong\n\nand how to put it right, has obvious attractions for them.\"\n\n\n\nIn the introduction to a poll on Eastleigh published on Thursday, Ashcroft\n\nwrites: \"The Ukip attraction . . . reflects a frustration with the political\n\nclass and with the way they think things are going in Britain. Our task is not\n\nto become more like Ukip, the party of easy answers, but to be the party of\n\ngovernment that people want to vote for.\" But one greater danger for Farage is\n\nthat he will now come under less benign media scrutiny, and that can be\n\ndangerous, as the Liberal Democrats have discovered.\n\n\n\nUkip make the Lib Dems look like an oasis of normality. Blogs abound describing\n\nthe obscure factional fighting and legal challenges that disfigure Ukip's\n\ninternal politics. Some of its MEPs have ended up in jail for expenses fiddles,\n\nbeen expelled or, like their South East England MEP Marta Andreasen, defected to\n\nthe Tories. She described Farage as a \"Stalinist dictator with a problem about\n\nwomen\".\n\n\n\nAnother defector, David Campbell-Bannerman, said Ukip had \"become very much a\n\none-man band and a bit of a cult\". Farage's own views, if more widely known,\n\nmight repel some voters. He writes in his autobiography that \"20% of the UK's\n\nteachers should be sacked because they are useless functionaries. Parents,\n\nteachers and politicians have cowered away from their responsibilities.\"\n\n\n\nFarage loves the limelight, and generally receives sympathetic interviews\n\nbecause he is quotable and engaging, but whether he will love it as much in six\n\nmonths' time is unlikely. For after Eastleigh he is now playing in the big\n\nleague.\n\n\n\nJonathan Freedland, page 43\n\n\n\nLeader comment, page 44\n\n\n\n",

Labour's John\n\nO'Farrell came fourth with 4,088. Turnout was 52.8 %.\n\n\n\nNick Clegg, facing growing questions over his own leadership, will regard it as\n\na stunning triumph that his party survived against the backdrop of the previous\n\nLib Dem MP Chris Huhne resigning and now facing a prison sentence for asking his\n\nwife to take speeding points.\n\n\n\nClegg also faced a week-long media barrage in the run-up to polling day over his\n\nhandling of allegations of sexual impropriety by the party's former chief\n\nexecutive, Lord Rennard.\n\n\n\nThe former party leader Paddy Ashdown praised Clegg's resilience, saying he had\n\nwithstood \"the most ravenous media feeding frenzy I have ever experienced as a\n\nLib Dem in 40 years of politics\".\n\n\n\nSimon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, said the result showed the party could\n\nretain its fortresses at the 2015 election, and was a victory for its local\n\norganisation. An even more ebullient party president Tim Farron claimed: \"This\n\nis a staggering result and the people who had written us off will have egg all\n\nover their faces. It will a turning point in this parliament and that we are in\n\na position to win this seat completely changes the narrative of the parliament\".\n\n\n\nThornton praised the effective fighting spirit in his party.\n\n\n\nThe Conservative failure in Eastleigh raises searching questions over whether\n\nCameron has a credible strategy not just to topple the 15 Lib Dem-held seats\n\nneeded to secure an overall majority, but also to prevent Ukip as the new party\n\nof protest gnawing into his wider vote in the next general election.\n\n\n\nAll the mainstream parties will now have to decide whether to respond to Ukip's\n\ngrowing popularity by becoming more Eurosceptic and anti-immigrant, or instead\n\nchallenging the party as an empty vehicle of protest. Cameron had hoped he had\n\nimmunised himself from the Ukip threat by promising a referendum on EU\n\nmembership after the election, and ramping up the rhetoric on EU migration.\n\n\n\nThe Ukip candidate Diane James said: \"The result was momentous. Three weeks ago\n\nwe said we wanted to create a four way marginal what we have done is create a\n\ntwo-way marginal. To have come from absolutely nowhere to achieve that is a\n\nfantastic result\".\n\n\n\nNigel Farage, Ukip's leader, promised to put 2,000 candidates into the field in\n\nthe May county council elections, insisting that \"this was not a freak result,\n\nbut shows that something is moving\".\n\n\n\nHe predicted border controls and immigration will become central to the future\n\nEU debate in the UK, and claimed a \"political earthquake\" was coming.\n\n\n\nThe Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said it was rare for a governing party to\n\ncapture a seat, but insisted that \"come a general election voters will make a\n\nchoice between whether they wanted David Cameron or Ed Miliband walking up\n\nDowning Street\".\n\n\n\nLabour came a disappointing fourth, but denied the result casts a shadow over Ed\n\nMiliband's claims that his vision of One Nation Labour has enough content to\n\nappeal in southern England. In 2010, Labour won nearly 10% of the vote in\n\nEastleigh, but instead of Labour becoming the vehicle for a protest against the\n\ngovernment, Ukip - which had 3.6% share in 2010 - has surged past Labour.\n\n\n\nLabour admitted immigration had been the main national issue on the doorstep,\n\nand Miliband is to dedicate a TV political broadcast to the issue next\n\nWednesday,\n\n\n\nLabour insisted it could still win its target seats in the south but added that\n\nin Eastleigh it simply did not have the local base in a short campaign to match\n\nthe Lib Dems' ground operation.\n\n\n\nThe Lib Dems poured thousands of activists into the seat, they have a\n\nstranglehold on the council and Clegg visited the constituency five times.\n\n\n\nBut as recently as the 1994 byelection, when there was a Conservative government\n\nand Labour were the main opposition, Labour secured 27.6%.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, when Labour last won a general election, they scored 20.6% in\n\nEastleigh.\n\n\n\nPatrick Diamond, page 38 >=\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nMike Thornton, the Lib Dem candidate, secured victory\n\n\n\nin the bitterly fought Eastleigh byelection early this morning\n\n\n\n",

How to encourage a friend to change, if your eyes are searching for your\n\ncoat?\" he asked at a Policy Network conference in London.\n\n\n\nThe intervention by Van Rompuy, who chairs and organises the regular EU summits,\n\ncame as Cameron served notice that Britain would challenge an EU agreement to\n\nslash bankers' bonuses at a meeting of European finance ministers next week.\n\n\n\nAmid fears that the EU agreement could deal a hammer blow to the City of London,\n\nCameron said EU regulations needed to be flexible enough to allow international\n\nbanks to operate in Britain and the rest of the EU.\n\n\n\nAt a meeting of Nordic leaders in the Latvian capital, Riga, he said: \"We need\n\nto make sure that regulation put in place in Brussels is flexible enough to\n\nallow (international) banks (in London) to continue competing and succeeding\n\nwhile being located in the UK.\"\n\n\n\nBritain will need to win allies to amend, or reject, the plans hammered out in\n\nBrussels on Wednesday night between officials from the EU's 27 members, MEPs and\n\nthe European commission. They are decided by qualified majority voting, which\n\nmeans no member state has a national veto.\n\n\n\nBut there were signs that the UK is in danger of alienating one of its closest\n\nallies when the Netherlands questioned Cameron's plan to use a future treaty\n\nchange, which may be held to underpin the euro, as a way of repatriating powers.\n\n\n\nFrans Timmermans, the Dutch foreign minister, told the Policy Network: \"We will\n\ndo everything to avoid treaty change if we can fix (the eurozone) within\n\nexisting treaties. I believe this is the common opinion in almost all member\n\nstates. This is going to be an interesting case for the British government. If\n\nthey still want a referendum one would ask: a referendum on what if you don't\n\nhave a treaty change?\"\n\n\n\nIn the first setpiece response from a European leader to Cameron's speech, Van\n\nRompuy endorsed the Dutch view that there is scant appetite for renegotiating\n\nthe Lisbon treaty. \"Changing the EU treaties is not the priority,\" he said. \"The\n\nwork ahead is crucial, but I see no impending need to open the EU treaties for\n\nit. Nor do I feel much appetite for it around the leaders' table.\"\n\n\n\nThe president warned that UK government policy on Europe was not just a matter\n\nto be sorted out between London and Brussels. It had to be agreed with 26 other\n\ngovernments which were already adjusting their policies and decision-taking\n\nbecause of the Cameron campaign.\n\n\n\nIn remarks not voiced in public since Cameron made his much-delayed referendum\n\nspeech last month, and delivered in London to boot, the former Belgian prime\n\nminister said: \"The wish to redefine your country's relationship with the union\n\nhas not gone unnoticed. I cannot speak on behalf of the other presidents and\n\nprime ministers, but I presume they neither particularly like it, nor\n\nparticularly fear it.\"\n\n\n\nArguing that Britain had much to gain by remaining a central player in the EU,\n\nand that pooling sovereignty with Germany, France and the other 25 member states\n\nactually magnified UK clout, Van Rompuy called on Cameron to play a more\n\nassertive and positive role in pressing its liberal, free-trade agenda.\n\n\n\nOlli Rehn, the influential commissioner for monetary affairs, echoed Van\n\nRompuy's call for Britain to play a more central role, warning that it \"should\n\nnot seek to undo our community. This is a game in which, if I were a British\n\ncitizen, I would want my country to be playing as a midfield playmaker rather\n\nthan watching from the sidelines. No one ever scored goals sitting on the\n\nbench.\"\n\n\n\nVan Rompuy conceded that Cameron would be able to discuss the changes he was\n\nseeking at an EU summit, while appearing to rule out any fundamental revision of\n\nBritish membership terms.\n\n\n\nSenior officials and EU ambassadors in Brussels confirmed this was the\n\nprevailing view among the other governments.\n\n\n\nAppearing to deliver a message to Cameron and Britain that had been co-ordinated\n\nwith other EU capitals, Van Rompuy said: \"The thing is, stepping out of existing\n\nareas of co-operation is not just a matter between 'London' and 'Brussels'. It\n\nwould impact on the relationship between your country and 26, soon 27 others. It\n\nis with each of them - friends, neighbours and partners - that you'll have to\n\nmake your case.\"\n\n\n\nVan Rompuy warned that Britain was free to exit the EU, but that the exit\n\n\"doesn't come for free. It would be legally and politically a most complicated\n\nand unpractical affair. Just think of a divorce after 40 years of marriage.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nHerman Van Rompuy told the London conference that other EU states did not fear\n\nthe UK calls Photograph: Carl Court/AFP\n\n\n\n",

Yesterday Clegg was forced to admit that Rennard's resignation in\n\n2009 was not purely on health grounds, but against a backdrop of allegations\n\nabout sexual harassment.\n\n\n\nThe seat is the Tories' 55th most marginal target seat, requiring a 3.3% swing.\n\nBut senior Tory sources acknowledged it was highly unlikely they would win in\n\nEastleigh, saying the Rennard issue had not resonated with the public.\n\n\n\nConfidence was expressed that the Tories' candidate, Maria Hutchings, who has\n\nfought a troubled campaign, could see off a last-minute push by Ukip.\n\n\n\nBut with some betting sites putting Ukip at evens to win, Nigel Farage, the\n\nparty's leader, said he would be disappointed if the Ukip candidate only came\n\nthird.\n\n\n\nCampaigning in the constituency for a seventh time, Farage hardened the party's\n\nline on immigration by suggesting that an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians\n\nnext year could lead to a surge in crime.\n\n\n\nPointing to Office for National Statistics figures published this week showing\n\nthe number of Romanians arrested over the past five years in London, Farage\n\nsaid: \"I think this highlights even more strongly than in the terms we set out\n\nto begin with why people should use this byelection as an opportunity to send a\n\nshattering message to the coalition that we do not want total open-door\n\nimmigration to Romania and Bulgaria.\"\n\n\n\nOn his party's chances, he said: \"We're excited. If Cameron loses it's a\n\ndisaster, if Clegg loses it's a catastrophe. Us losing doesn't do us a lot of\n\nharm, us winning will break the dam.\"\n\n\n\nThe Ukip candidate, Diane James, said she believed she could send shockwaves\n\nthrough the political establishment.\n\n\n\nDavis, who contested the Tory leadership with Cameron in 2005, suggested the\n\nTory right would pump up the pressure for a different economic strategy in the\n\nbudget next month.\n\n\n\nHe said the cuts programme needed to be fiercer. \"We've had a lot of rhetoric\n\nabout austerity; we need a bit more reality about it. We need more cuts I'm\n\nafraid, or at least those same cuts faster.\"\n\n\n\nHe added the route to growth lay through lower taxes.\n\n\n\nLabour is preparing for its candidate, the writer John O'Farrell, to come fourth\n\nin what may be seen as a rebuff for Ed Miliband's one nation message.\n\n\n\nShadow cabinet members who have been in Eastleigh say immigration was an issue\n\non the doorstep. Miliband has already made two speeches on immigration since he\n\nbecame leader and a third is in the pipeline. Cameron has attempted to stave off\n\na Ukip surge both by promising a referendum on the EU after the general\n\nelection, and by hinting at restricting EU migrants' access to benefits.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOh happy day. The Italian election result is a triumph for democracy. \"No pope,\n\nno government, no police chief,\" went yesterday's viral tweet, hailing the\n\narrival in Rome of \"punk politics\". The outcome is an antidote, not just to\n\nItaly's corrupt politics, but to the dogma of austerity that now has Europe's\n\neconomy by the throat. The only way of loosening its grip is through the ballot.\n\nCongratulations, Italy.\n\n\n\nThe most spectacular victor is Beppe Grillo, a rollicking satirist but with a\n\nclear message: that austerity, the euro and corruption are jointly to blame for\n\nItaly's ills. We can argue the issues, but why bother when no one listens? Just\n\ntell those in charge, as he says, to fuck off. When politicians banned Grillo\n\nfrom TV, he turned to the blog and the piazza. His knockout blow was the ballot.\n\n\n\nGrillo's chief victim is the short-lived prime minister, Mario Monti. He was\n\npushed into office by the banks a year ago to impose unlimited suffering on the\n\nItalian economy, so as to shore up the euro and thus protect German and other\n\nbank loans from devaluation. Darling of the bankers' ramp, he was Super-Mario.\n\n\n\nLike Greece and with no local currency to take the strain, the Italian economy\n\nhad to be waterboarded. It shrank by at least 2.2% last year, with official\n\nunemployment at about 10%. Monti promised to hold the Italian economy in its\n\ndownward spiral, without growth and ever less able to repay its mounting debt.\n\nFuture generations would be in perpetual bondage to German banks.\n\n\n\nGrillo spoke for those generations. His one roughly coherent policy may be a\n\nreferendum on the euro, but leaving the euro is the key that unlocks the prison\n\ndoor. Even the revival of the outrageous Silvio Berlusconi is good news: his\n\nirresponsibility might contribute to pushing Italy into financial crisis and\n\neventual salvation.\n\n\n\nFor what seems an entire decade, Europe is to be dominated by the \"politics of\n\nausterity\", a gamble with the economy of an entire continent on a par with that\n\nof the 1920s. Leaders (and their bankers) claim that austerity is a \"necessary\"\n\npunishment, to be visited on European people for allowing their governments to\n\nborrow beyond their means. The policy offers no growth to pay off the debts, and\n\nfor the eurozone no devaluation to reduce their incidence. The message is forget\n\nKeynes and take the medicine, even if it is poison.\n\n\n\nDespite being outside the euro straitjacket, Britain's George Osborne holds that\n\nausterity knows no bounds. As he starves the economy of demand and it duly\n\nshrinks, his revenue slides - and the debt and deficit rise. There is a classic\n\nvicious circle. Sooner or later, austerity becomes an end, not a means: an\n\nobsessive self-flagellation. These finance ministers are like Aztec priests at\n\nan altar. If the blood sacrifice fails to deliver rain, there must be more\n\nblood.\n\n\n\nYou can fool a democracy only so long. The current anti-Keynesian dogma has\n\nlasted four years and is just not working. In Greece and Spain, unemployment is\n\ntouching an appalling quarter of the workforce. France is in trouble and, even\n\nin Germany, the strain is telling as growth falls.\n\n\n\nEurope's leaders are steadily dragging their joint economies towards depression,\n\nafflicting their competitive relation with the outside world possibly for ever.\n\nNor can they blame others. They are doing it to themselves, voluntarily, in\n\nobeisance to the gods of confidence, who long ago abandoned them.\n\n\n\nClearly no new idea will dent these dogmatists. Economists are to modern\n\ngovernment what doctors were to tobacco companies, as good as the last fee.\n\nChange will only come, as Chesterton said, with \"a sharp blow to the head\" and\n\nfrom a blunt instrument.\n\n\n\nThat instrument is the ballot. If there is one thing a politician dreads more\n\nthan a central banker, it is an election. Greece briefly fell last year under\n\nthe spell of the anti-austerity star, Alexis Tsipras. Holland is fiercely\n\nanti-austerity. France saw the anti-austerity left bundle Nicolas Sarkozy out of\n\noffice. Spanish austerity is at the mercy of maverick separatists. Italy has\n\nGrillo, with heaven knows what result.\n\n\n\nTomorrow at the Eastleigh byelection, the party of Britain's own Grillo is\n\npredicted to shock the coalition government. Ukip's Nigel Farage may come from\n\nright of stage, but his appeal is similar to Grillo's. Conventional politics has\n\ngone bureaucratically native. The European tier of government is aloof and the\n\neurozone rigid. One-solution Europe does not fit all. The wildcats have the same\n\ncry: follow me to the forum and throw the bastards out.\n\n\n\nItaly has long been Britain's favourite foreign country. Even as its two great\n\ninstitutions, the republic and the catholic church, stumble into corruption and\n\nimmorality, all must be well. This is Italy where even the ungovernable is bella\n\nfigura. No one believes this will cease.\n\n\n\nYet wildcat populism always terrifies the existing order. In America it is the\n\nTea Party and Occupy. In Scandinavia, Holland, Austria and France, a communist,\n\npoujardist or fascist periodically crashes the system. Mosley did it in pre-war\n\nBritain. Since then Powellism, nationalism, Respect, even the odd Liberal has\n\nthreatened, for a while, to upset the bipartisan apple cart.\n\n\n\nIt seldom lasts. Italian politics will establish a new equilibrium. If lucky it\n\nwill be outside the euro and on the way to recovery; if not it will be in\n\nlifetime bondage to eurozone bankers. Either way Italy will remember the heady\n\nmoment of February 2013, and so should we.\n\n\n\nsimon.jenkins@guardian.co.uk\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThree years of German-led austerity and budget cuts aimed at saving the euro and\n\nretooling the European economy was last night facing one of its biggest\n\nchallenges as Italian voters' rejection of spending cuts and tax rises opened up\n\na stark new fissure in European politics.\n\n\n\nThe governing stalemate in Rome and the vote in the general election - by three\n\nto two - against the austerity policies pursued by Italy's humiliated caretaker\n\nprime minister, Mario Monti, meant that the spending cuts and tax rises dictated\n\nby the eurozone would grind to a halt, risking a re-eruption of the euro crisis\n\nafter six months of relative stability.\n\n\n\nFears that the deadlock will lengthen Italy's near two-year recession and spill\n\nover into the rest of the eurozone hit markets across Europe. The Italian\n\nbanking sector fell 7% in value, dragging the main MIB stock market index 4%\n\nlower.\n\n\n\nThe market turmoil in Milan spread to Germany, France and the UK, with domestic\n\nbanks among the biggest fallers. Deutsche Bank saw almost 5% knocked off its\n\nvalue, while Barclays suffered a 4% decline. The FTSE 100 fell 1.4%. The German\n\nDax slumped more than 2% and the Paris Cac was down 2.75%.\n\n\n\nThe cliffhanger vote saw the maverick comedian Beppe Grillo's 5 Star movement\n\ntake almost one in four of the votes and the political revival of the ex-prime\n\nminister Silvio Berlusconi. But the narrow victor, Pier Luigi Bersani, on the\n\ncentre-left, claimed the mantle of the premiership, although it was unclear if\n\nhe would be able to form a government.\n\n\n\nDespite the withering popular verdict on cuts and taxes, Brussels and Berlin\n\ninsisted the austerity programme had to be continued in Italy. France and others\n\nseized on the outcome for their own purposes, arguing for a relaxation of\n\nspending cuts and greater emphasis on policies to boost growth and job creation.\n\n\n\nBersani moved to try to cobble a government together by wooing the upstart\n\nGrillo with tentative talk of a reformist leftist coalition. Looking weary,\n\nBersani said it was time for the 5 Star movement to do more than just demand a\n\nclean sweep of Italy's established political order.\n\n\n\n\"Up to now they have been saying 'All go home'. But now they are here too. So\n\neither they go home as well, or they say what they want to do for their country\n\nand their children.\"\n\n\n\nGrillo said earlier his followers in parliament would not join a coalition, but\n\nwould consider proposals \"law by law, reform by reform\".\n\n\n\nBersani said that, since his four-party alliance had won an outright majority in\n\nthe lower house of the Italian parliament and more seats than any other grouping\n\nin the Senate, it had a responsibility to suggest ways in which Italy could be\n\ngoverned, despite the deadlock in the upper house.\n\n\n\nShunning the idea of a grand coalition with Berlusconi and the right, he\n\nproposed a government committed to a five-point plan for sweeping reform of\n\nItaly's political parties and institutions.\n\n\n\nThe north-south split in Europe opened up by the election presaged clashes\n\nbetween eurozone governments, likely to surface at an EU summit next month, amid\n\ncalls for a shift away from the harsh regime prescribed and driven through by\n\nBerlin in recent years as the price of bailing out insolvent eurozone periphery\n\ncountries.\n\n\n\nThe Italian stalemate combines with tough negotiations over a bailout for Cyprus\n\n- being resisted by Germany - worries about the French economy, an unresolved\n\ndebt crisis in Spain, and David Cameron's decision to throw Britain's future in\n\nEurope into question, making EU politics unusually volatile.\n\n\n\n\"Italy plays a central role in successfully overcoming Europe's debt crisis,\"\n\nsaid the German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle.\n\n\n\n\"So we assume that the policy of fiscal consolidation and reform will be\n\nconsistently followed by a new government.\"\n\n\n\nAngela Merkel, bidding for a third term as German chancellor in September, has\n\nbeen banking on a period of eurozone calm in the runup to her election, but\n\nItalian voters have wrecked that calculation.\n\n\n\nThe Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, recently made head of the\n\npolitical committee that runs the euro, said Monti's policies had to be\n\ncontinued: \"They are crucial for the entire eurozone.\"\n\n\n\nThe European Commission echoed the calls for sticking with the austerity\n\nmedicine. Italy has the highest national debt level in the eurozone after\n\nGreece, although its budget deficit is in better shape than many others,\n\nincluding France and the Netherlands.\n\n\n\nBut Paris led the chorus for a policy shift. French government ministers,\n\nincluding Pierre Moscovici, the finance minister, demanded a change of course in\n\nremarks directed at Berlin.\n\n\n\nSpain waited anxiously to see what impact the Italian leap in the dark would\n\nhave on its debt crisis. \"This is a jump to nowhere that does not bode well\n\neither for Italy or for Europe,\" said the foreign minister, Jose Manuel\n\nGarcia-Margallo, adding he was \"extremely concerned\" about the effect on Spain's\n\nborrowing costs.\n\n\n\nBoth Berlusconi and Grillo have been harshly critical of the Germans, decried\n\nMonti's austerity packages, and have raised questions as to whether Italy, the\n\neurozone's third biggest economy, should remain in the single currency. Grillo\n\nhas called for a referendum on the matter.\n\n\n\nBerlusconi rounded on the Germans yesterday, declaring that the \"spread\" - the\n\ndifference between how much Italy and Germany pay to borrow on the bond markets\n\n- had been \"invented\" two years ago. This was code for saying that Berlin and\n\nFrankfurt, the German government and the European Central Bank, conspired to\n\npush up the cost of Italian borrowing in 2011 in order to topple Berlusconi and\n\nbring in Monti, the technocratic darling of the eurozone elite.\n\n\n\nThe turmoil saw Italian bond yields also jump, indicating that any new\n\ngovernment will be forced to pay a higher interest rate on its debts.\n\n\n\nThe 10-year Italian bond yield edged back into dangerous territory yesterday\n\nafter it passed 4.9%, although this is a far cry from 2011 when the yields shot\n\nup above 7%.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leader of Italy's centre left, Pier Luigi Bersani, set out yesterday to lure\n\nBeppe Grillo and his Five Star Movement (M5S) into a coalition government after\n\ntheir spectacular breakthrough in the general election.\n\n\n\nAt a press conference in Rome, a weary-looking Bersani said it was time for the\n\nupstart movement to do something more than just demand the removal of Italy's\n\nmainstream politicians.\n\n\n\n\"Up to now, they have been saying: 'All go home.' But now they're here, too. So\n\neither they go home as well, or they say what they want to do for their country\n\nand their children.\"\n\n\n\nGrillo had earlier said his followers in parliament would not join a coalition,\n\nbut would consider proposals \"law by law, reform by reform\".\n\n\n\nBersani said that since his four-party alliance had won an outright majority in\n\nthe lower house of the Italian parliament, and more seats than any other\n\ngrouping in the senate, it had a responsibility to suggest ways in which Italy\n\ncould be governed, despite the deadlock in the upper house caused by the M5S's\n\nstunning gains.\n\n\n\nPouring cold water on the idea floated by Silvio Berlusconi of a grand coalition\n\nwith the right, he proposed a government committed to a radical overhaul of\n\nItaly's politics and institutions, outlining a five-point plan for sweeping\n\nreform.\n\n\n\nIn a clear attempt to lure M5S into the mainstream, he hinted that Grillo's\n\nmovement, as the party with most votes, should get the speakership of the lower\n\nhouse.\n\n\n\nTalking to reporters outside his home in Genoa, Grillo, who has always denied\n\nbeing the leader of the M5S, announced he would be representing his movement in\n\nthe negotiations with President Giorgio Napolitano aimed at forming a new\n\ngovernment. But he made clear that the movement he co-founded just over three\n\nyears ago remained as anti-establishment as ever.\n\n\n\nHe said he would like to see the iconoclastic Nobel prize-winning playwright and\n\nactor Dario Fo succeed Napolitano as head of state. And he declared that Italy\n\nwas in the midst of a \"generational war\".\n\n\n\nGrillo also predicted that Italy's next government would last no more than six\n\nmonths. \"They won't be able to govern,\" he said. \"Whether I'm there or not, they\n\nwon't be able govern.\"\n\n\n\nBersani made it clear that he considered his alliance to have been defeated in\n\nthe election. \"We have not won, even if we finished first,\" he said. He also\n\nacknowledged that the elections signified \"a rejection of politics as it has\n\nbeen presented in recent years: (a rejection of) inefficient institutions and of\n\npolitics that have appeared as morally non-credible.\"\n\n\n\nThe five points on which he was inviting a consensus were: reform of\n\ninstitutions; reform of political parties; legislation on public and private\n\nmorality, an apparent reference to measures to tackle corruption; the defence of\n\nthose most exposed to the effects of the recession; and a commitment to a new\n\nEuropean employment policy.\n\n\n\nBut, in a reference to the thorniest issue that is likely to lie between him and\n\nGrillo, Bersani made it clear he would not compromise on his party's policy\n\ntowards the EU or the euro. Grillo has called for a referendum on membership of\n\nthe single currency. But, said Bersani, \"Italy out of the euro would run into\n\ndisaster.\"\n\n\n\nThough at one point he left the door open a crack to Berlusconi's Freedom People\n\nmovement, he later said that he and the leader of the right would \"confront each\n\nother in parliament\".\n\n\n\nBersani was not the only one to be courting Grillo, the new kingmaker of Italian\n\npolitics. His overtures to M5S came as his leading partner in the centre left,\n\nNichi Vendola, dropped a hint he might be considering a separate deal with\n\nGrillo's movement. Vendola, the governor of Puglia, where the centre left took\n\none of its worst hidings in the election, is also the leader of the radical\n\nLeft, Ecology and Freedom party. In a message sent through Twitter, he flattered\n\nthe founder of the M5S, saying: \"Grillo is the true winner of the elections.\"\n\nAnd he added: \"Phoney alliances will not be enough.\"\n\n\n\n",

For us, more Europe\n\nmeans a European Germany,\" he said, adding that Germans had a very specific\n\nrelationship with and sense of obligation towards Europe precisely because of\n\ntheir past. \"After all, it was from our country that the attempts to destroy\n\neverything European, all universal values, were unleashed,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe pointed out that today's young Europeans \"experience more Europe than\n\neveryone else before you\", and that they had become so used to travelling across\n\nthe continent without needing to show passports or change money, that they now\n\ntook those advantages for granted.\n\n\n\nBut, he said, at a time of crisis, the time had come for Europeans to have a\n\nmore active relationship with the union. \"Don't ask what Europe can do for you,\n\nbut ask what you can do for Europe,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nJoachim Gauck, the German president, said Britain's role in saving Europe from\n\nthe Nazis made it key to the continent's future\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo speeches yesterday, one by a man who has been this country's prime minister,\n\nthe other by a man who wants to be our next one, mark what may be a watershed\n\nmoment in the party politics of this parliament. Sir John Major's speech at\n\nChatham House supporting David Cameron's EU referendum proposal was a decent\n\nspeech by a decent man. But it could not escape being a reminder of what was,\n\nand still is, wrong with the Conservative party. Significant though the issue\n\nunquestionably is, Europe is neither the most important question facing Britain\n\ntoday nor the one that tops most people's list of concerns. But it is the number\n\none obsession of large parts of the Tory party, and that obsession warps\n\neverything else. Sir John is right that a vote to stay in the EU would be good\n\nfor Britain, but he of all people ought to know that a Tory party consumed by\n\nthe European issue is not good for this country - and will deserve to be\n\npunished for it.\n\n\n\nEver since Mr Cameron focused his attention on this predominantly internal party\n\nissue last month, the Tory party's poll ratings have suffered. The Guardian's\n\nICM poll this week, showing the Tories down at 29% and a strong Labour lead of\n\n12 points, was striking evidence of the penalty the Conservative party is\n\npaying. ICM's findings have subsequently been confirmed by other polls this week\n\nwhere the figures are in similar territory. The Tories' wilful misreading of the\n\npublic mood is inescapably an opportunity for Labour to cement its appeal. But\n\nit is also a challenge to the opposition too. To win an election and govern\n\neffectively, Labour will have to win the voters' confidence, not simply offer\n\nitself as the vessel through which voters express their irritation with Tory\n\nfailings. The purpose of Ed Miliband's speech in Bedford yesterday was to begin\n\nthe task of winning that confidence.\n\n\n\nMr Miliband's overarching aims were to establish the declining living standards\n\nof ordinary people as the central battleground of the 2015 election and to\n\naddress Labour's trailing poll ratings on economic management. His narrative of\n\nmodern Britain, as he explained to our political editor this week, is that the\n\ndisproportionately growing wealth of those at the top is not just squeezing the\n\nliving standards of those on the middle and bottom rungs of the ladder, but is\n\nalso smothering the chances of growth. The message yesterday was that rewards\n\nand incentives for the many can be both the engine of new growth and also a more\n\ngenerous form of wealth distribution. It is a powerful message, giving a bit of\n\nsubstance to the rather nebulous One Nation slogan, and potentially well suited\n\nto hard economic times. And while Mr Miliband's specific pledges of a (welcome)\n\nmansion tax on property worth over Â£2m and the (questionable) restoration of a\n\n10p in the pound tax bracket do not seal the deal, they are clear markers of the\n\ndirection that a Labour government could take. Promises of cheaper train tickets\n\nand energy bills are easier to make than deliver, but this is plainly fertile\n\nterrain.\n\n\n\nThere was tactical cunning in Mr Miliband's speech as well as a big picture.\n\nEmbracing the 10p tax pledge - which has its supporters on the Tory benches -\n\ncramps George Osborne's style in his budget planning. Taking up the mansion tax\n\ngives Labour something substantive to talk about to the Liberal Democrats if a\n\ndifferently configured hung parliament emerges in 2015. Openly criticising\n\nGordon Brown goes some way towards answering taunts that Labour's Eds are part\n\nof the problem not the solution. It would be naive to pretend that this speech\n\nis a game-changer.\n\n\n\nLabour has an economic credibility deficit that will not be overcome by a single\n\nspeech. Mr Miliband has not won the argument yet and still seems reluctant to\n\ntalk about Britain's economic problems in the wider global context with which Mr\n\nCameron, for all the false conclusions he draws, seems more comfortable. But Mr\n\nMiliband has begun to write something specific on what for too long has been\n\nLabour's fiscal blank page. For that alone, he deserves credit for a good day's\n\nwork.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an old adage that any poll that makes a good headline is probably\n\nwrong, and it is possible that the Guardian/ICM poll giving Labour its largest\n\nlead since 2003 is an outlier. But ICM is probably the most respected polling\n\norganisation in the country and does not have a notable history of producing\n\nwild results from out of the blue.\n\n\n\nThis poll shows a sharp reversal in the coalition's fortunes. In the previous\n\npoll, last month, Labour's lead narrowed from eight points, a margin it had\n\nenjoyed for three consecutive months, to five. Now that lead has widened to the\n\nlargest since the fall of Saddam Hussein, when voters praised Tony Blair for his\n\ndecisive action in ridding the Middle East of a brutal dictator.\n\n\n\nIt is hard to pinpoint a set of events in the past month that justifies a surge\n\nin Labour support. Ed Miliband has had a relatively low profile in the new year,\n\nwhile David Cameron has played his populist card on an EU referendum.\n\n\n\nThose in Downing Street who thought the prime minister's move would not only\n\nquieten the backbenches but lead to a poll boost have been frustrated. Dissent\n\non the Tory benches over Cameron's leadership and the issue of gay marriage has\n\ncontinued unabated.\n\n\n\nAlmost all polls show that jobs and the economy are what move voters most. There\n\nis some evidence that the Conservative lead on the economy is receding, and long\n\nhas been among female voters. February's Guardian/ICM poll shows 29% of voters\n\nstill blame Labour for the economic crisis and 23% the Conservatives.\n\n\n\nIt is possible that the economy's return to negative growth in the fourth\n\nquarter of 2012 was a turning point. The chancellor, George Osborne, will have\n\nto work ever harder to convince the electorate that the economy is healing, and\n\nif it is not, that the responsibility lies with Ed Balls and Ed Miliband.\n\n\n\nThe poll also shows Cameron, despite a year of internal discussion in No 10 on\n\nhow to address this issue failing to improve his popularity with women voters.\n\nWhereas among men Labour enjoys a seven-point lead over the Tories (36%-29%),\n\namong women it is 26 points (51%-25%). The government's recent handling of\n\nchildcare announcements has obviously not instilled confidence.\n\n\n\nSo if the coalition continues to bang goals into its own net, Labour can reach\n\nfull-time in 2015 without its defensive lines being tested. At the moment it\n\nsurvives week after week without any serious media scrutiny. But even strong\n\nLabour supporters acknowledge that the party's lead is at best soft.\n\n\n\nAnthony Painter, writing on the website Labour List and drawing on polling\n\nprepared by the former Conservative deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, points out\n\nthat on three of the four most salient issues - welfare dependency, immigration\n\nand cutting the deficit - Labour not only trails the Conservatives but\n\nsignificantly so.\n\n\n\nPainter concludes: \"If Labour fails to narrow its deficit on welfare,\n\nimmigration and debt, and the economy turns for the better before 2015, then its\n\npoll lead is likely to narrow very rapidly.\"\n\n\n\nThe Institute of Fiscal Studies said recently that the UK economy could grow\n\nrapidly in late 2014 or early 2015, and certainly faster than the rest of the\n\nEU. At that point Osborne will ram home the argument that voters should not give\n\nthe keys back to the driver who steered the car into the ditch. From here it\n\nsounds a compelling argument.\n\n\n\nBy then Labour will have to convince voters that it has the values to lift the\n\neconomy. The issue is whether Labour has the intellectual resolve and internal\n\nunity to come up with policies to turn that aspiration into reality.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nLabour has forged a 12-point lead over the Conservatives for the first time in\n\nalmost a decade, according to a Guardian/ICM poll.\n\n\n\nEd Miliband's party stands at 41% of the vote, up three points on ICM's January\n\nfigure, and the Tories are on just 29%, having slipped back four from 33% last\n\nmonth. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have sunk two points, to 13%, whereas\n\nUkip has inched up three to 9% - setting a new record for Nigel Farage's\n\nanti-European outfit in the Guardian/ICM series.\n\n\n\nUnderlying the dire numbers for the Conservatives are signs of a gender divide\n\nthat will concern No 10. Among men Labour enjoys a seven-point lead over the\n\nTories (36%-29%), but among women the gap is 26 points (51%-25%).\n\n\n\nLast month's coalition proposals to shake up childcare provision were aimed at\n\nattracting the female vote. The crushing two-to-one split in the female vote\n\nagainst the Tories is far too large to be explained by any quirk of this month's\n\nICM's sample. In January's poll - a better month for the Tories - whereas prime\n\nminister's party was actually one point ahead of Labour among men (36%-35%),\n\namong women it was already 16 points behind (29%-45%).\n\n\n\nThe Labour lead is the biggest - and the Conservative vote share the smallest -\n\nin the polling series since May 2003, during the brief political bounce for Tony\n\nBlair which came between the felling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad and\n\nfirst stirrings of civil war in Iraq and arguments about dodgy dossiers.\n\n\n\nWith his party plumbing the sort of depths associated with the second half of\n\nthe John Major era, David Cameron will be dismayed with the continuing surge in\n\nUkip support, a challenge on the right flank which the prime minister's recent\n\nspeech proposing a referendum on the EU was designed to head off. In the runup\n\nto this month's Eastleigh byelection yesterday's poll suggests that Conservative\n\nhopes in the seat formerly held by Chris Huhne will have to rest more upon the\n\nweakness of their coalition partners than anything else.\n\n\n\nLabour's 12-point lead with ICM is larger than leads of nine and 10 points\n\nrecorded by two other polls reported by the Sunday Times and the Observer at the\n\nweekend, and it is striking because ICM's methodology - which has delivered many\n\nimpressive predictions in past elections - adjusts the figures for \"shy Tory\n\nvoters\", the name given to the difference between the proportion who vote for\n\nthe party in elections and the proportion who say they will vote for the party\n\nin opinion polls.\n\n\n\nThe detail of the new poll warns that Labour's new lead is not solid. The\n\nsluggish economy will be the decisive battleground of the next election, and\n\nafter Britain's dive into a fresh economic contraction in the final quarter of\n\n2012, the opposition might have expected to be winning the blame game. Instead,\n\nmore voters point the finger at the last Labour government than the coalition.\n\n\n\nAsked to name the chief culprit for the economic slowdown, 29% identify Labour's\n\n\"debts . . . racked up to finance unsustainable spending\". This is the same as\n\nwhen the question was asked last May.\n\n\n\nWhile Labour has failed to make any progress in this respect since May, the\n\ncoalition has slipped back. At that time only 17% of voters blamed government\n\ncuts, compared with 23% now, whereas 24% identified \"chill economic winds\n\nblowing in from the eurozone\", a proportion that has now shrunk to 16%, as the\n\ncrisis in the single currency has entered a less acute phase. The 21% of voters\n\nwho blame bankers for \"refusing to provide loans\" that firms need for investment\n\nremains unchanged.\n\n\n\nAmong other assorted parties, the Scottish National party is at 2% (down one on\n\nthe month) while Plaid Cymru holds steady on 1%. The Greens' numbers also remain\n\nunchanged, at 2%, while the British National party picks up a point, to stand at\n\n2%.\n\n\n\nICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1001 adults aged 18+ by telephone on\n\n8-10 February 2013.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe age of austerity caught up with the European Union yesterday when a\n\ngruelling 26-hour negotiation resulted in agreement to slash the new seven-year\n\nEU budget by 3.3%, or euros 32bn, the first reduced budget in the union's\n\nhistory.\n\n\n\nThe outcome was seen as a notable victory for David Cameron, who spearheaded a\n\nnorth European campaign for budget cuts, and a defeat for his polar opposite in\n\nthe bargaining, Francois Hollande, whose pleas for a relaxation of austerity and\n\nfor more spending to spur growth were rejected.\n\n\n\n\"The British public can be proud that we have cut the seven-year credit card\n\nlimit for the EU for the first time ever,\" Cameron said. \"The major problem we\n\nhave had is the credit card limit for the EU has been too high. It has always\n\nbeen pushed up and at last someone's come along and said this has got to stop.\"\n\n\n\nBut Cameron acknowledged that, while the EU budget as a whole would be reduced,\n\nBritain's own contributions to the EU would increase. He blamed this on changes\n\nto the UK's EU rebate, introduced by Tony Blair in 2005, which ensure that the\n\n12 new member states have a partial exemption from the compensatory payments to\n\nBritain.\n\n\n\nCameron's satisfaction contrasted with Hollande's downbeat tone: \"Europe has not\n\nwon as much as it could have.\"\n\n\n\nIn the short term, Hollande managed to protect French farmers by securing a\n\neuros 1bn increase in the contested common agricultural policy compared with\n\nfigures proposed in November. The CAP took up by far the biggest chunk of the\n\nnew budget, 39%, but overall farm subsidies and spending are being cut by euros\n\n50bn compared with the seven-year period ending this year as its share of the\n\ntotal comes down progressively.\n\n\n\nFollowing three years of financial crisis that threw the survival of the euro\n\ninto doubt and triggered swingeing cuts in public spending and services in many\n\nEU member states, Cameron argued that the EU budget could not be immune from the\n\nausterity. The summit agreed to cut the budget from more than euros 992bn in the\n\ncurrent period to euros 960bn, or 1% of EU gross domestic product, the figure\n\nstipulated by the strongest politician in the EU, Angela Merkel.\n\n\n\nThis figure refers to spending pledges, while Cameron opted to focus on the\n\nlower figure of euros 908.4bn, agreed as the supposed ceiling on what may be\n\nspent.\n\n\n\nFrance sought to get the second figure increased to euros 913bn, triggering an\n\novernight clash between London and Paris, with Germany cast in the role of\n\nmediator and ultimately siding with Cameron.\n\n\n\nAfter snubbing a bargaining session with Cameron and Merkel as the summit opened\n\non Thursday afternoon, Hollande later conceded. Unusually, senior French\n\nofficials paid tribute to the PM.\n\n\n\n\"He's a true negotiator with a lot of tenacity,\" said a French official. \"At one\n\npoint (Hollande) said there needs to be a compromise . . . Cameron did not need\n\nan agreement because the rebate is safe.\"\n\n\n\nThe crucial swing factor was Merkel, who broadly sided with Cameron, while\n\nHollande decided against leading a troika of France, Italy, and Spain.\n\n\n\nGiven Cameron's recent speech on Europe, committing the UK to an in-out\n\nreferendum by 2017, there was much rancour that his views should prevail when it\n\nis not clear if Britain will be in the EU by 2020.\n\n\n\nIf Cameron won and Hollande lost, there were many who argued that Europe's\n\nfuture prospects also lost out in a bout of horsetrading that prioritised\n\nnational and vested interests over smart investment.\n\n\n\nNational lobbies were bought off essentially by ransacking planned funding for\n\ndigitalisation, broadband investment, hi-tech, research, transport networks, and\n\ninfrastructure.\n\n\n\nSome euros 50bn was raided from these areas in order to accommodate competing\n\nnational claims on the two biggest items in the budget - the CAP and the\n\ncohesion funds that go mainly to eastern Europe and the less developed parts of\n\nthe union.\n\n\n\nUnlike national budgets, the EU budget cannot be financed by borrowing and\n\ndeficit spending is outlawed. The euros 52bn gap between pledged spending and\n\nthe spending cap insisted on by Britain had critics predicting trouble ahead.\n\n\n\nMartin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, said the budget figures\n\nwould break EU law and warned that the parliament would refuse to endorse them.\n\nThe budget needs to be passed by an absolute majority. The four biggest\n\nparliamentary caucuses promptly denounced the deal. France sounded supportive of\n\na rejection.\n\n\n\nThe PM also demanded savings of up to euros 7bn in the salaries, pensions and\n\nadministration costs of the EU institutions. The issue is symbolic - the costs\n\nare only 4% of the budget. The administrative budget was finally cut by only\n\neuros 1bn.\n\n\n\nLeader comment, page 38 >=\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nAngela Merkel ultimately sided with Cameron's demand for cuts - and against\n\nFrancois Hollande's pleas for spending to spur growth Photograph: Thierry\n\nRoge/EPA\n\n\n\n",

Looking mildly tired after 25 and a half hours on the\n\ngo, the prime minister hailed his achievement in negotiating the first ever cut\n\nin an EU budget.\n\n\n\n\"The British public can be proud that we have cut the seven-year credit-card\n\nlimit for the EU for the first time ever,\" he said before travelling home.\n\n\n\nCameron will receive a warm, and possibly rapturous, reception from Tory MPs on\n\nMonday when he reports back on securing his aim of a cut or real-terms freeze in\n\nthe EU's near-euros 1tn (Â£845bn) budget. While his red, puffy cheeks showed\n\nsigns of a gruelling experience, it is difficult to imagine a better outcome or\n\nmore fortunate timing for the prime minister.\n\n\n\nWeeks after he was warned that he was marginalising Britain in the EU by\n\noutlining plans for a referendum by 2017, Cameron has shown that Britain can\n\nshape events. He believes the summit shows the wisdom of his three calculations\n\nabout the EU: that Britain should never underestimate its ability to be a major\n\nplayer in the EU; it should not be frightened of laying down red lines not to be\n\ncrossed; and most importantly, that the key player in EU negotiations is the\n\nGerman chancellor, Angela Merkel.\n\n\n\nIf she is pushed too far, Merkel will bite, as she did in 2011 when she drew up\n\nthe eurozone fiscal compact treaty outside the EU after Cameron wielded a veto.\n\nBut if she believes that Cameron's demands are reasonable, then she will work\n\nconstructively with him, as she did over the EU budget.\n\n\n\nCameron might, however, like to bear in mind the thinking of Merkel's officials\n\nbefore the first budget summit in November. Berlin was prepared to see Cameron\n\nisolated to show Merkel's displeasure as she awaited his speech on the EU, which\n\nshe feared would be hostile. In the end, Merkel worked closely with Cameron in\n\nNovember for one simple reason: she agreed with his call for restraint.\n\n\n\nThe German chancellor is keen to co-operate with Cameron at a tactical level -\n\nif she agrees with him - and at a broader strategic level to maintain the UK as\n\nan influential member of the EU as a counterweight to the protectionist French.\n\nBut Merkel's support should never be taken for granted.\n\n\n\nCameron will need to calibrate his negotiating stances with care when he embarks\n\non the delicate task of repatriating EU powers, as he promised in his Bloomberg\n\nspeech on the EU.\n\n\n\n",

The Conservatives were the first party to unveil a candidate for the\n\nbyelection prompted by the fall of Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne. The Tory party\n\nchairman, Grant Shapps, came to the Hampshire town to launch Hutchings's\n\ncampaign.\n\n\n\nThe first curveball was pitched within moments when Hutchings was asked how she\n\nwould have voted on gay marriage. \"I would have not voted for same-sex\n\nmarriage,\" she replied. Candidate and chairman walked along Market Street and\n\nvisited Smedley's butcher shop before adjourning to the Poppins cafe, where she\n\ndid a round of interviews.\n\n\n\nHutchings, 51, explained how she had lived in this former railway town since\n\nbeing selected to run against Huhne at the last election. She said she was a\n\nhard-working mother-of-four who \"lived and breathed the constituency\". She was\n\ndetermined to run a clean campaign and would not be drawn to comment on Huhne's\n\nconviction. \"That issue is in the past,\" she said.\n\n\n\nHutchings, who describes herself as a worker in the communications industry,\n\nadmitted she once had to borrow Â£1.80 to pay for parking from members of a job\n\nclub she ran in Eastleigh because a cash machine would not give her any money.\n\n\n\nBut the first really awkward moment came when she was asked about interviews she\n\ngave to the Daily Mail eight years ago. Hutchings, who has a son with autism,\n\nhit the headlines - and attracted the attention of Tory strategists - during the\n\n2005 general election after confronting Tony Blair about education for children\n\nwith special needs.\n\n\n\nIn one subsequent interview she is quoted as saying: \"I don't care about\n\nrefugees.\" In another she allegedly said: \"It is the minority groups that have\n\nbenefited from Labour's time in office - the immigrants, the gays, the bloody\n\nfoxes.\"\n\n\n\nOf the first interview, Hutchings explained: \"What I said to the Daily Mail\n\njournalist was there is a limited pot of money, my son is very vulnerable, I'm\n\ntold he needs these services and yet that pot of money has got to stretch. That\n\nDaily Mail journalist said to me: 'So what do you think abut immigration and\n\nasylum seekers?' What I said was: 'I don't care about talking about asylum\n\nseekers because I'm here to talk about my son.'\"\n\n\n\nOf the second interview she said simply: \"I've never said anything about gays or\n\nbloody foxes. . . and I don't know where that's come from.\" Pressed on\n\nimmigration, she said: \"My thoughts about immigration are very much like the\n\npeople of this country. People are out for fairness, it's got nothing to do with\n\nrace.\"\n\n\n\nShe pointed out that her mother, Vicky, is from Malta and continued: \"We have a\n\nvery good record of caring about people coming to this country. But we are going\n\nthough very difficult times and people want to be sure that they are getting the\n\nmost they can get for their families.\"\n\n\n\nAsked if immigration should be limited she replied: \"Yes, which is what we are\n\ndoing.\" She declined to say what the limit should be, arguing: \"That is well\n\nabove my pay grade.\"\n\n\n\nShe spoke about the need to protect the countryside against development. On her\n\nwebsite she says: \"Everyone wants to see new family homes, but bulldozing over\n\nour green spaces is not way to do it.\"\n\n\n\nInevitably, the issue of Europe was brought up. Initially Hutchings managed to\n\nbat the questions away. But as she was being ushered away by her minders, she\n\nwas asked how she would vote in a referendum and replied: \"If there was a\n\nreferendum now, I would vote out.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nMaria Hutchings: questioned over Daily Mail interviews during 2005 election\n\n\n\n",

The campaign, which was hoping to collect 120 signed letters in\n\nsupport of the millionaire MP for Windsor, has been widely derided by MPs who\n\nhave said that it would be \"mad\" for the party to turn to a relative unknown who\n\nhas never held ministerial office. Cameron made light of the challenge this\n\nweek, telling MPs: \"The Conservative party has always stood for people who want\n\nto work hard and get on and I'm glad that all of those behind me take that very\n\nseriously indeed.\"\n\n\n\nBut the Guardian understands from members of the government and from prominent\n\nbackbenchers that there is a growing belief that enough MPs are prepared to\n\ntrigger a vote of confidence in the prime minister in the summer of 2014 if the\n\nTories experience a setback in the local elections.\n\n\n\nSuch a contest would be triggered automatically if 46 MPs - 15% of the\n\nparliamentary party - write to the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady.\n\n\n\nOne MP said: \"There is a core of MPs that is determined to get rid of Cameron\n\nright now. They think he lost the last election, they think he cannot win the\n\nnext election and maybe doesn't even want to win the election. They think he\n\njust likes the idea of being a coalition prime minister.\n\n\n\n\"While this group are wrong to think of a move now, there would be support for a\n\ncontest if there is no movement for the party by 2014. There would be no problem\n\nin drumming up 46 letters to Graham Brady at that point. I could name them. I\n\nwould support it.\"\n\n\n\nThe MP voiced the hope that the prime minister would revive his and the party's\n\nfortunes. \"Maybe Cameron will turn things round. He is very good when his back\n\nis against the wall. But he is hopeless at managing the team room.\"\n\n\n\nOne member of the government said of the rebels: \"This is not necessarily about\n\nwaiting until 2015 and seeing if David Cameron loses. This is about being ready\n\nfor the moment when the party realises that Cameron is not a winner.\"\n\n\n\nThe MP said that while the Afriyie campaign was not credible, it had touched a\n\nnerve as the party looked to a future where it could be led by someone whose\n\nbackground contrasts dramatically with Cameron's.\n\n\n\n\"Colleagues are fed up with the posh boys. They do not look like the country. I\n\nwould love it if a working class guy of mixed race became our leader. It would\n\nsay to Labour - wrong again. We had the first woman leader, the first Jewish\n\nleader and now the first black leader.\"\n\n\n\nThe manoeuvring has exposed divisions among supporters of Afriyie. The former\n\nfrontbencher maintains that he only ever intended to stand if Cameron resigned\n\nafter losing the 2015 election. But some of his supporters want to unseat\n\nCameron now.\n\n\n\nLoyalists insist that the Afriyie campaign had ended up strengthening the prime\n\nminister.\n\n\n\nOne member of the government said: \"What this week has done is guarantee that\n\nDavid Cameron will lead us into the next election. The Afriyie campaign is mad\n\nand far too premature.\" But the MP added: \"Clearly there are MPs who want David\n\nout.\"\n\n\n\nOne minister said: \"I have been involved in Conservative politics for 20 years.\n\nThe Conservative party is never not plotting.\"\n\n\n\nOthers were more dismissive. One prominent backbencher said: \"David Cameron will\n\nlead us into the next election. These people are somewhat deluded. What is their\n\nproblem?\n\n\n\n\"The prime minister has an incredibly difficult job and he has just promised us\n\na referendum on our membership of the EU with a deadline.\"\n\n\n\nThe prospect of a leadership contest will focus attention on Brady whose\n\npredecessor, Sir Michael Spicer, was chairman of the 1922 Committee when a vote\n\nof confidence triggered the downfall of Iain Duncan Smith in 2003.\n\n\n\nIt is understood that Brady already has a handful of letters in his safe calling\n\nfor a vote of confidence in Cameron. At least one MP sacked from the Tory\n\nfrontbench by Cameron has written. But Brady is praised by Cameron and by MPs\n\nacross the party for being the soul of discretion.\n\n\n\nThe events of the past weeks have also clarified in the minds of senior Tories\n\nthat George Osborne enjoys negligible support on the Tory benches should he\n\ndecide to stand.\n\n\n\n12-13>=\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nA vote of confidence in Cameron would be triggered if 46 MPs write to Graham\n\nBrady, chairman of the 1922 Committee\n\n\n\n",

The Guardian has learned that talks between Danny Alexander of the Lib\n\nDems and Oliver Letwin of the Tories have effectively broken down over which of\n\nthe 130 measures are regarded as so vital that Britain would immediately ask\n\nBrussels for permission to opt back into them.\n\n\n\nHowe questioned Cameron's plan to hold a referendum by the end of 2017 if he\n\nwins the next general election. The former chancellor, who prompted Michael\n\nHeseltine to challenge Thatcher in 1990, told peers: \"I would like to think I\n\nwas wrong in suspecting that the prime minister's sudden conversion to the\n\nmerits of a referendum is less about occupying the moral high ground of\n\ndemocratic consent than the search for a means to overcome the problems of\n\ninternal party management.\"\n\n\n\nHowe, who steered through the EEC accession bill as attorney general in Ted\n\nHeath's government in the early 1970s, added: \"I don't believe a referendum is\n\nthe way in which to address this question. Our own national parliament . . . not\n\na widely consulted referendum, is the true source of democratic legitimacy and\n\naccountability.\"\n\n\n\nAshdown spoke of a \"virulent little Englander\" movement in the Conservative\n\nparty, which \"want out altogether\". He added: \"The difference between Britain\n\nand the rest is we are negotiating wanting to get out, while the rest of them\n\nare negotiating wanting to get further in.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister came under fire in the Lords as the US administration\n\nreiterated its belief that Britain should remain an active member of the EU. An\n\nadviser to Joe Biden, the US vice-president who is to visit Britain next week,\n\nsaid: \"Obviously it's up to member states of the EU to make their own decisions.\n\nWith respect to prime minister Cameron's speech, we obviously support his\n\ncomments about the important role of the UK in the EU. We leave it to EU member\n\nstates to have discussions.\"\n\n\n\nAnother US official said: \"It's in our interest for there to be a strong UK in a\n\nstrong EU.\"\n\n\n\nThe remarks echo the intervention by Philip Gordon, the US assistant secretary\n\nfor European affairs, who said that the US wanted Britain to remain an active\n\nmember of the EU.\n\n\n\nThe calls from the US came as coalition divisions over Europe risked scuppering\n\nnegotiations over British co-operation on EU police and criminal justice\n\nmeasures. Both sides of the coalition agree that Britain should exercise a\n\nright, granted by the Lisbon treaty, to opt out of around 130 justice and home\n\naffairs (JHA) measures. But the Liberal Democrats will not sanction this mass\n\nopt-out unless the Tories agree to opt back in to key measures such as the\n\nEuropean arrest warrant.\n\n\n\nA source with knowledge of the talks has confirmed that \"they are not making a\n\ngreat deal of progress; they are having to work through the package on a\n\ncase-by-case basis\".\n\n\n\nA breakdown over the issue has serious implications for David Cameron's strategy\n\non Europe, as this is one of the main matters on which he was hoping to secure\n\ndemonstrable progress this side of the general election.\n\n\n\nThe row at the heart of the coalition's European strategy broke out yesterday\n\nwhen the minister without portfolio, Ken Clarke, \"announced\" on BBC Radio 4's\n\nToday programme that ministers would opt back in to 30 of the 130 measures that\n\nwere regarded as essential for crime and justice purposes.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nHowe said parliament should have the final say on the UK's place in Europe\n\n\n\n",

Clarke held talks\n\non this at a recent EU-Latin America summit in Chile with Karel de Gucht, the\n\nEuropean trade commissioner.\n\n\n\nThe former chancellor said that Cameron was right to say in his landmark speech\n\nlast week on Britain and Europe that the EU could reform. But he made it clear\n\nthat Britain must be an active player.\n\n\n\n\"When the UK plays an active, leading role in Europe, we can achieve enormous\n\nthings which we simply could not on our own,\" Clarke said. \"So the real\n\nchallenge for us as we debate our role in the EU is working out what we should\n\nbe pushing forward, what we should be leading on within the EU, to make it - and\n\nus - a more effective economic and global power.\"\n\n\n\nClarke called on pro-Europeans to make the case for the EU more effectively as\n\nhe called for the fulfilment of Margaret Thatcher's two key European ambitions -\n\ncompleting the single market and expanding the EU by admitting Turkey.\n\n\n\n\"The time has obviously now come for us to put the case more strongly and more\n\ncoherently,\" he said. \"It is in our vital national interest that we avoid the\n\nfatal mistake that would be a no vote if a referendum is held in the next few\n\nyears.\"\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Mandelson claimed that Eurosceptics had \"got away with murder\".\n\nThe former European trade commissioner said: \"For far too long, those who want\n\nto destroy Britain's interests and influence in Europe have been allowed to get\n\naway with murder with the lies and false propaganda they have poured out about\n\nthe European Union and what it represents for our country. This cannot go\n\nunchallenged any more. The pro-Europeans have bided their time. Now we must\n\nunbide our time.\"\n\n\n\nAlexander made clear the Liberal Democrats' deep unease at the prime minister's\n\nplan when he warned of the dangers posed by those who \"put anti-European\n\nideology ahead of our national interest\". He said: \"We cannot afford to give the\n\nimpression that we are going to disengage. Britain's national interest demands\n\nthat we maximise our influence and use that influence to boost growth, trade and\n\njobs.\n\n\n\n\"That is the only way to protect British jobs. It's a position that is\n\npro-business and pro-Britain too. It should be obvious to all that we are more\n\npowerful negotiating from inside Europe than from the sidelines.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nIn his speech, the former chancellor called for the completion of the single\n\nmarket and the admission of Turkey to the EU\n\n\n\n",

No one in the UK, the other member states or\n\nthe EU institutions is seeking treaty amendment or any alteration to governance\n\nof the UK. This vote has nothing to do with such profound issues. David\n\nCameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum in several years' time, on issues\n\nyet to be identified and negotiated, by a government yet to be elected, has not\n\nbeen made in pursuit of legitimacy or certainty or, indeed, democracy.

The comments by Robin Southwell, the ADS\n\nchairman, will be given extra credence by his day-to-day role as the chief\n\nexecutive of UK operations at EADS, the Franco-German industrial conglomerate\n\nthat owns Airbus, one of Britain's biggest manufacturing employers.\n\n\n\nIn a speech at the ADS annual dinner tonight, Southwell will say: \"As we debate\n\nBritain's role in Europe in the years to come, what we should not question is\n\nour role at the heart of the European aerospace sector. After all, if you look\n\nat both exports and imports, the eurozone does more business with the UK than\n\nwith any other trading bloc. How many of you know that the UK recently overtook\n\nFrance and the US to become Germany's single largest trading partner?\"\n\n\n\nHe adds: \"If that doesn't place us at the heart of Europe, then nothing does. So\n\nwhatever the outcome for Britain's role in Europe, we must ensure that we remain\n\npart of the European economic community in protecting opportunities for\n\ninvestment, partnership and growth in our sector.\"\n\n\n\nThe failure last year of the euros 35bn (Â£30bn) merger between EADS and BAE\n\nSystems, Britain's biggest defence contractor, has stoked fears within\n\ngovernment and industrial circles that work on the next generation of Airbus\n\naircraft, as well as other big aerospace and defence projects, will drift away\n\nfrom the UK. Airbus employs about 10,000 people in the UK, largely at its wing\n\nmanufacturing plant in Broughton, north Wales, and at its design and testing\n\nfacility in Filton, near Bristol.\n\n\n\nMinisters and aerospace industry executives are drawing up a new strategy\n\ndocument that is likely to include plans for an aerospace research centre, in\n\naddition to the centre of excellence for aerodynamics announced by George\n\nOsborne last year. The strategic update is being co-ordinated by the Aerospace\n\nGrowth Partnership, a body that brings together government ministers, officials\n\nand UK-based aerospace companies including Rolls-Royce, the aircraft engine\n\nmaker; Bombardier, which makes plane wings in Belfast; GKN, the components\n\nsupplier; and AgustaWestland, the Yeovil-based helicopter maker.\n\n\n\nBritish business leaders, including the CBI and the WPP boss, Sir Martin\n\nSorrell, have warned that the prime minister's promise of an in-out referendum\n\non the European Union in 2017 will create an atmosphere of uncertainty that\n\ncould jeopardise investment plans. ADS represents the aerospace, defence,\n\nsecurity and space industries in the UK, which are among the biggest employers\n\nin the British economy.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe constitutional argument for a referendum on Europe is clear. We elect MPs to\n\nmake decisions in parliament on our behalf, but not to transfer the powers of\n\nparliament to other bodies. That is why the transfer of legislative powers\n\ndownwards, through devolution, requires a referendum. So also, since the\n\nEuropean Union Act 2011, does the transfer of powers upwards to the EU.\n\n\n\nBut since we entered Europe in 1975, numerous powers have been transferred\n\nwithout our consent. And the referendum requirement poses a particular dilemma\n\nfor a party of the left, which seeks to be both internationalist and sensitive\n\nto the demands of the people. That is why Labour has always had a bad conscience\n\nabout Europe.\n\n\n\nIn 1962 its leader Hugh Gaitskell famously declared that a federal Europe would\n\nend \"1,000 years of history\". His successor Harold Wilson agreed but in office\n\nsought - unsuccessfully - to enter Europe. In opposition he veered again,\n\nopposing entry in 1973 on \"Tory terms\", but uniting the party through the device\n\nof the referendum which, in 1975, yielded a two-to-one majority for Europe - the\n\ngreatest triumph pro-Europeans have ever enjoyed.\n\n\n\nIn opposition, however, Labour swung again and, in 1981, proposed leaving Europe\n\nwithout a referendum - one of the issues that led to the SDP breakaway, helping\n\nto put Labour in opposition for 18 years. Michael Foot and Tony Benn put their\n\nprejudices on Europe above the needs of social democracy. Today pro-Europeans\n\nmust avoid doing the same.\n\n\n\nOn no issue has there consistently been a greater gap between the people and the\n\npolitical class than Europe. Survey evidence shows that a large minority, and in\n\nsome polls a majority, want to leave the EU; but, in the Commons, only a small\n\nminority of MPs favour exit. On Europe, parliament no longer represents the\n\npeople.\n\n\n\nCritics say that the referendum will lead to uncertainty which is bad for\n\ninvestment. But without popular endorsement, Britain's position in Europe is\n\nbound to be enveloped in permanent uncertainty, so weakening its chances of\n\nconstructive engagement.\n\n\n\nThe EU, moreover, is in flux. Britain cannot remain unaffected if the eurozone\n\nmoves towards banking union. The eurozone in any case remains highly unstable,\n\nand Greece, along with other Mediterranean states, might well exit.\n\n\n\nBritain has, of course, always been the awkward partner. There are good reasons.\n\nThey were summed up by President de Gaulle when, 50 years ago this month, he\n\nproclaimed his veto. De Gaulle declared that the Treaty of Rome had been signed\n\nby six \"continental states . . . which were of the same nature\". Britain, by\n\ncontrast, was \"insular, she is maritime, she is linked through her exchanges,\n\nher markets, her supply lines, to the most diverse and often the most distant\n\ncountries; she pursues essentially industrial and commercial activities, and\n\nonly slight agricultural ones\". That was why she was so opposed to the Common\n\nAgricultural Policy.\n\n\n\nDe Gaulle concluded that \"the nature, the structure, the very situation that are\n\nEngland's differ profoundly from those of the continentals\". But he accepted\n\nthat Britain might, in the future, evolve \"little by little towards the\n\ncontinent\". The referendum will test whether Britain has done so.\n\n\n\nThere is a fundamental decision to be made and only the British people can make\n\nit. Europe has for too long been an elite project. The pro-Europeans have been\n\ncontent to win the argument in the corridors of power. That is why, since 1975,\n\nthe argument has been lost by default. But Labour was formed to combat the power\n\nof elites, not to yield to it.\n\n\n\nThe constitutional argument for the referendum is based fundamentally on the\n\nneed for legitimacy. Some decisions are so momentous that they cannot be decided\n\nby MPs alone, but need popular endorsement. It is difficult to think of a more\n\nmomentous issue than whether Britain should remain in the EU.\n\n\n\nHarold Wilson's policy adviser, Bernard Donoughue, said that, while Edward Heath\n\ntook the British establishment into Europe, it needed Wilson to take the British\n\npeople into Europe. Today the political and financial establishment remain\n\ncommitted to Europe, but the people are leaving in droves. That is the basic\n\ncase for the referendum and the left should support it.\n\n\n\nVernon Bogdanor is professor of government at King's College, London.

His stance\n\ndelighted Eurosceptic backbenchers.\n\n\n\nO'Grady will tell the European Trades Union Congress that Cameron has already\n\nmade it easier for employers to sack people and more difficult for workers to\n\nget justice in the courts.\n\n\n\nShe will state: \"There's one set of workers' rights David Cameron can't touch.\n\nThose are the rights provided for by social Europe - paid holidays, health and\n\nsafety, equal treatment for part-time workers and women, protection when a\n\nbusiness is sold off, and a voice at work. The prime minister wants to\n\nrepatriate those rights, and not because he thinks he can improve them. Cameron\n\nwants to make it easier for bad employers to undercut good ones, drive down\n\nwages, and make people who already work some of the longest hours in Europe work\n\neven longer. To do that he needs agreement from the rest of Europe.\"\n\n\n\nShe will urge European unions to mount campaigns in their own countries against\n\nCameron's reforms. \"What (he) is trying to do isn't just opt out of social\n\nEurope, he wants to undercut it.\"\n\n\n\nClegg yesterday dismissed prospects of securing a significant renegotiation and\n\nsuggested that Cameron should concentrate on the economy.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, the Liberal Democrat leader said Cameron\n\nwas engaged in an \"arcane\" debate about the precise terms of the membership of\n\nthe EU. \"It is not in the national interest when we have this fragile recovery,\n\nwhen we have a very open economy which is very dependent on investors in the car\n\nindustry and the banking system and so on. You must always, when you are trying\n\nto piece together a recovery, foster those precarious conditions of greater\n\nconfidence in the economy.\"\n\n\n\nHe claimed most businesses he had spoken to were worried by the uncertainty\n\nconcerning a referendum and its consequences. \"Is it deliverable to, in effect,\n\nsay to the rest of the EU: we want to do all the bits that we like, but can you\n\nkeep all the stuff that we think is not good for the economy? That is not\n\nplausible.\"\n\n\n\nGrant Shapps, the Tory chairman, said the government was not ignoring the\n\ncountry's economic position by developing a new policy on Europe. \"Europe is a\n\nbig central issue which has a major effect on most people's daily lives,\" he\n\ntold Dermot Murnaghan on Sky News.\n\n\n\nLater, speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he raised the possibility of Britain\n\nleaving the EU if renegotiations fail. \"I think most people in this country\n\nagree that Europe isn't what we originally signed up for. If we can't get any\n\npowers back at all, then we'll be in a different position,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ed Miliband, Labour's leader, defended his opposition to a referendum\n\non the EU. \"Right now it doesn't make sense to commit to a referendum years\n\nahead.\n\n\n\n\"Has (Cameron) changed his mind because he's changed his view about the national\n\neconomic interest? Or has he changed his mind because he's worried about Ukip? I\n\ncontend it's the second, not the first.\"\n\n\n\nA ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday put the Tories up\n\nfive points on 33% following Cameron's speech.

Rumours had been circulating in Westminster that\n\nwith the Tories behind in the polls, a challenger could take on David Cameron.\n\n\n\nYesterday morning, a name emerged from the shadows in two right-leaning\n\nnewspapers - and it was not Boris Johnson, Michael Gove or any of the big names.\n\n\n\nIt was Adam Afriyie, the suave multimillionaire MP for Windsor, who within hours\n\nwas rather keen to insist he had no designs on Downing Street as a \"stalking\n\nhorse candidate\" if the Tories fail to deliver a majority government in 2015.\n\n\n\nBoth the Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Times had claimed he had a campaign team\n\nin place and backbenchers were being asked to sign a pledge of support in\n\nexpectation of a future leadership challenge.\n\n\n\nAfter several hours of speculation, Afriyie appeared on Sky News to say he had\n\nheld regular talks with colleagues \"about the long-term future of the party\" but\n\nrejected suggestions he was being lined up as part of any plot to oust its\n\nleader.\n\n\n\n\"I will never stand against David Cameron, I am 100% supportive of David Cameron\n\nand I am working with many colleagues but to make sure we give the Conservatives\n\nthe best chance of winning . . . the 2015 election,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\n\n\"When you are working with an organised team to try to achieve something\n\npositive for the party and for David Cameron, it is inevitable that all sorts of\n\nrumours leak out.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes politicians are tactical rather than strategic. They seek short-term\n\nfixes to their problems without thinking about the long-term consequences. They\n\nget good reviews on the day but the plan soon unravels. That is certainly the\n\nstory of David Cameron's Europe speech on Wednesday. He received plaudits from\n\nhis backbenches and temporarily discomfited Ed Miliband, but at the cost of\n\ncreating long-term problems for his party and the country.\n\n\n\nI have spent most of my life involved in diplomatic negotiations of one sort or\n\nanother, including 10 years in No 10 wrestling with EU matters. From a purely\n\nnegotiating point of view, I have seldom seen a weaker opening hand than that\n\nwhich Cameron dealt Britain in his speech on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nFirst, if you issue an ultimatum, the \"or else\" needs to be something the others\n\nreally don't want to happen. Most of the other 27 members would rather we didn't\n\nleave the EU, but they are not going to pay a serious price to persuade us to\n\nstay, especially if we are planning to stay partially in the union.\n\n\n\nSecond, you get your way in the EU by building alliances. Cameron's emphasis on\n\ncompetitiveness as the key challenge for Europe is laudable, and widely shared.\n\nAs a \"pre-in\" during the Blair years, we could attract allies, for example, to\n\nstop the French and Germans sticking the Belgian Guy Verhofstadt into the top\n\njob. But nobody is going to want to form an alliance with Britain if we are a\n\n\"pre-out\". By indicating he will leave if he doesn't get his way, Cameron has\n\njust destroyed his chances of securing any allies.\n\n\n\nThird, all Cameron is really saying is that if there is treaty change, there\n\nwill be a referendum. That pretty much goes without saying. We proposed a\n\nreferendum on the constitutional treaty, but then didn't have to go through with\n\nit because the French and Dutch voted the treaty down first. It is precisely\n\nbecause Angela Merkel knows that treaty change would require a referendum - not\n\njust in Britain but in other European countries - that she is avoiding a new\n\ntreaty. If there is no new intergovernmental conference, how does Cameron get a\n\nnegotiation going inside the EU when nobody else wants one? And even if there\n\nwere to be a new treaty, the last one took 10 years to negotiate, so we wouldn't\n\nbe having a referendum till 2023.\n\n\n\nLast, the government has said that it will set out the changes it is seeking in\n\nits next manifesto for us all to see. So if the other Europeans were to decide\n\nto make some concessions to help him out, it would be perfectly apparent to his\n\nbackbenches and the Eurosceptic press that he had achieved only a few cosmetic\n\nchanges. In those circumstances, how could he lead a campaign with all his\n\n\"heart and soul\" for Britain to remain in Europe?\n\n\n\nCameron has therefore set up circumstances in which he cannot succeed. The\n\nlong-term consequences of snookering himself and the country so completely are\n\ntwofold. First, far from solving the division within the Conservative party,\n\nthis will make matters worse. Cameron has just fired the starting gun on a\n\nfive-year no campaign.\n\n\n\nEurosceptics will spend the intervening period doing nothing but \"banging on\n\nabout Europe\", and Conservative candidates at the next election will no doubt\n\nface demands to pledge to vote to leave the EU or face a Ukip challenge. The\n\nCorn Laws ripped the Tory party apart in the 19th century, imperial preference\n\n(free trade within the British Empire) in the early 20th, and it looks like\n\nEurope will do the same in the 21st.\n\n\n\nSecond, while I don't for a moment imagine Cameron wants to be the prime\n\nminister who takes Britain out of Europe, he has set things up in such a way\n\nthat there is real risk he will do so by mistake. An in-out referendum in this\n\ncountry could be won. But only with political leadership of the sort we saw in\n\n1975. Since Cameron can't say whether he will vote yes or no until he has\n\nsecured all his demands, the field will be left to the anti campaign.\n\n\n\nCameron will have enjoyed the applause on Wednesday, but he and the rest of us\n\nwill come to rue the day.\n\n\n\nJonathan Powell was chief of staff to Tony Blair from 1995 to 2007\n\n\n\n",

We still believe that. We've never been passionate about\n\nausterity. From the beginning we have always emphasised that fiscal\n\nconsolidation should be slow and steady.\"\n\n\n\nOsborne said he had already adjusted his plans to the weaker-than-expected\n\neconomy, when he used last month's autumn statement to announce that fiscal\n\nconsolidation will now extend until 2017-18. \"It is credible, it is flexible,\n\nand we have already exercised that flexibility,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe Office for National Statistics will publish its first estimate of GDP growth\n\nfor the final quarter of 2012 today, amid forecasts that the economy has\n\ndeclined by up to 0.5% and is on the brink of a triple-dip recession.\n\n\n\nSeizing on Blanchard's remarks, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said: \"David\n\nCameron and George Osborne must finally heed the IMF's advice. After two and a\n\nhalf years of flatlining and a double-dip recession the IMF is now clearly\n\nlosing patience. The longer the government clings to its failing plan, the more\n\nlong-term damage they will do to our economy.\"\n\n\n\nNick Clegg conceded in an interview published yesterday that the coalition had\n\ncut capital spending too quickly. \"If I'm going to be sort of self-critical,\n\nthere was this reduction in capital spending when we came into the coalition\n\ngovernment. I think we comforted ourselves at the time that it was actually no\n\nmore than what Alistair Darling spelled out anyway, so in a sense everybody was\n\npredicting a significant drop off in capital investment,\" the deputy prime\n\nminister told House magazine. \"But I think we've all realised that you actually\n\nneed, in order to foster a recovery, to try and mobilise as much public and\n\nprivate capital into infrastructure as possible.\"\n\n\n\nPreviously Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has said that\n\neven if he had known the economy was going to grow as slowly as it has, he would\n\nhave done the same.\n\n\n\n\"We have urged ministers to bring forward infrastructure investment and build\n\nthousands more homes, but they have refused to listen,\" said Rachel Reeves, the\n\nshadow chief secretary.\n\n\n\nThere was a brief outburst of excitement on City trading floors at lunchtime\n\nyesterday as rumours circulated that the official GDP data had leaked out and\n\nthat some dealers were acting on data that would show the economy in better\n\nhealth than economists are expecting. There was a sudden blip in the currency\n\nmarkets, but the Office for National Statistics refused to comment.\n\n\n\nOsborne, who would have already seen the data before he spoke in Davos, repeated\n\nhis familiar mantra that \"we are walking a difficult road, but we are heading in\n\nthe right direction\".\n\n\n\nSpeaking a day after David Cameron pledged to try to renegotiate Britain's\n\nrelationship with the EU, and then offer the public a referendum on EU\n\nmembership, Osborne backed the prime minister's stance. \"Europe needs to change,\n\nto meet the expectations of all its peoples, no matter what country they live\n\nin,\" he said. \"Europe has to become a competitive place, where companies can be\n\nsecure, jobs are created, and young people have careers.\"\n\n\n\n",

The firm subsequently\n\npromised to pay Â£20m over two years.\n\n\n\nCameron's speech attracted strong criticism from the body that represents\n\nBritain's accountants, but the PM insisted he was the most \"pro-business leader\"\n\none could find. He said it was not just NGOs that had been lobbying him to crack\n\ndown on tax-dodging firms, but the upper echelons of the City too. \"It's a world\n\nwhere some companies navigate around legitimate tax systems - and even low tax\n\nrates - with an army of clever accountants.\"\n\n\n\nThere was nothing wrong with sensible tax planning, but \"some forms of avoidance\n\nhave become so aggressive that I think it's time to call for more responsibility\n\nand for governments to act accordingly\".\n\n\n\nHe said: \"In the UK we've already committed hundreds of millions into this\n\neffort - but acting alone has its limits. Clamp down in one country and the\n\ntravelling caravan of lawyers, accountants and financial gurus just moves on\n\nelsewhere. We need to act together at the G8.\"\n\n\n\nJohn Christensen, of the Tax Justice Network, welcomed Cameron's stress on\n\nbeating tax avoidance but said: \"It depends on the details. We need a complete\n\nroot and branch reform of how companies are taxed. How do you tax companies when\n\nthey live outside the nation state, in the ether, and can move their profits to\n\nwhere they pay the least tax?\"\n\n\n\nMichael Izza, chief executive of the ICAEW, which represents accountants, and\n\nwas in the audience at Davos, said he was disappointed to hear the prime\n\nminister \"again dismiss accountants, this time as an 'army' of avoiders\".\n\n\n\n\"We don't recognise that description. Our members do not support illegal tax\n\nevasion or the kind of aggressive tax avoidance that we believe to be unethical.\n\nIn fact, an effective accountancy and finance profession can and does help solve\n\nmany of the problems the prime minister wants to address.\"\n\n\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson said: \"Starbucks agrees that all businesses should pay\n\ntheir fair share. We employ 9,000 people in the UK, create nearly Â£300m worth of\n\nannual economic impact and are forgoing tax deductions that will ensure the UK\n\nexchequer is Â£10m better off in each of the next two years.\" The company last\n\nnight announced quarterly global profits of $432m (Â£274m). In a conference call\n\nwith analysts, Starbucks chief Howard Schultz and senior executives avoided\n\nmentioning the prime minister's comments.\n\n\n\nThere were concerns from other business leaders last night that additional rules\n\nover reporting tax could add to red tape for firms or make the UK less\n\ncompetitive than other countries.\n\n\n\nCameron used his speech to lay out his agenda for the G8 summit, which will be\n\nheld in June. As well as tightening up the international tax system, the prime\n\nminister said trade and transparency would be key priorities for Britain's G8\n\nchairmanship. He attacked companies which indulge in corrupt business practices\n\nin poor countries. Britain last occupied the G8 post in 2005, when Tony Blair\n\nput aid, trade and debt relief high on the agenda.\n\n\n\nCameron said there was still unfinished business on trade and called for the\n\ncompletion of a free trade deal between the EU and the US which he said could\n\nadd Â£50bn to Europe's economy.\n\n\n\nSeeking to reassure business, he said: \"I'm as pro-business a leader as you can\n\nfind.\" But he added: \"I'm a low-tax Conservative, not a 'businesses should pay\n\nno tax' Conservative.\"\n\n\n\nHe was proud that Britain was living up to its pledge to spend 0.7% of national\n\nincome on development assistance, but greater transparency was needed to make\n\nsure the aid was well spent. \"There's a long and tragic history of some African\n\ncountries being stripped of their minerals behind a veil of secrecy. We can see\n\nthe results: the government cronies get rich while the people stay poor.\"\n\n\n\nCameron said unleashing natural resources from developing countries for the\n\nbenefit of local people would dwarf anything aid could do - and transparency was\n\nvital to that. \"So we're going to push for more transparency on who owns\n\ncompanies, on who's buying land and for what purpose, on how governments spend\n\ntheir money, on how gas, oil and mining companies operate, on who is hiding\n\nstolen assets and how we recover and return them.\"\n\n\n\nSimon Jenkins, page 35 >=\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron and Angela Merkel meet at Davos, the day after the PM said he\n\nwould offer Britain an in-out EU referendum Photograph : Action Press/Rex\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Conservative policy of holding a referendum on staying in or quitting the\n\nEuropean Union would not necessarily prevent the Liberal Democrats forming\n\nanother coalition with them, Nick Clegg indicated last night. The Lib Dem\n\nleader's acceptance of a referendum as part of a future governing deal could be\n\ncrucial to forming a coalition if neither the Conservatives nor Labour win an\n\noutright majority at the next general election in 2015.\n\n\n\nClegg repeated his opposition to the proposal, outlined by Cameron on Wednesday,\n\nthat a future Tory government would renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU\n\nand then hold a referendum.\n\n\n\nA poll for theTimes this morning showed that if a referendum was held now, 40%\n\nwould vote in favour of leaving the EU, with 37% wanting to stay and 23%\n\nundecided.\n\n\n\n\"I simply don't understand the point of spending years and years tying yourself\n\nup in knots first, so-called 'renegotiating' the terms of Britain's membership\n\nin ways that at the moment at least, are completely vague,\" Clegg said during\n\nhis weekly phone-in programme on LBC radio. \"And I think that discourages\n\ninvestment and inhibits growth in jobs.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, when pressed on whether it would prevent the Lib Dems forming another\n\ncoalition with the Conservatives, Clegg appeared to suggest that ways could be\n\nfound to accept the referendum. Such a move has precedent in the last coalition\n\nagreement, where Tories supported a holding a referendum on alternative voting,\n\nbut campaigned against the idea.\n\n\n\n\"I'll follow the instructions of the British people,\" said Clegg. \"If a\n\ncoalition is necessary following the votes of the British people, then we'll\n\nplay our part.\"\n\n\n\nAsked by LBC presenter Nick Ferrari to confirm that he was saying the Lib Dem\n\nleader \"could work with him (Cameron) in a coalition\", Clegg added: \"I will\n\nalways play a responsible role. I've done it in the past at some political cost\n\nand I'll do it again if necessary to provide . . . good government in the\n\nnational interest.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, followed up her cautious\n\nindication on Wednesday that she was open to a \"fair compromise\" by yesterday\n\ndescribing Cameron as a \"friend\" and telling the World Economic Forum in Davos\n\nthat the eurozone's rules should be \"binding\" for themselves but \"freely\n\naccessible\" to other EU countries such as the UK.\n\n\n\nBillionaire George Soros also waded into the debate over a possible EU\n\nreferendum yesterday. Speaking over dinner at Davos, Soros said that Cameron was\n\nresponding to pressure from his own backbenchers with \"a dangerous gambit which\n\ncould actually lead to Britain leaving (the EU)\". He added that the UK is\n\ncurrently in \"the best of all possible positions,\" because it is a member of the\n\nEU, without being part of the crisis-hit single currency.\n\n\n\nSimon Jenkins, page 35 >=\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAs David Cameron entered the Commons at the end of a morning that began with his\n\nspeech on Europe, his backbenchers did something they rarely do these days. They\n\ncheered him to the echo. Moments earlier the Conservative chairman, Grant\n\nShapps, had announced on TV that the Europe speech had united the party. The\n\nsight of so many delighted Tory MPs, many of whom have become minor political\n\ncelebrities by making the prime minister's life miserable, seemed to suggest\n\nShapps was right.\n\n\n\nLooked at more carefully, however, it was a sight that brought to mind the\n\nfamous words of Sir Robert Walpole, declaring war on Spain in 1739: \"They now\n\nring the bells, but they will soon wring their hands.\" Or a scene that recalled\n\nsomething Tony Blair was fond of saying in the more recent past: \"The British\n\npeople may have their prejudices, but they get very uneasy when their\n\npoliticians start to share them.\"\n\n\n\nBe in no doubt. Cameron will enjoy a turbocharged good press. His poll numbers\n\nwill move up too. Much of the praise will be misdirected, however. This was an\n\nimportant speech about an important subject. The tone, especially in the parts\n\ndealing with the European Union's successes and failures, was practical and\n\nthoughtful. But the promise of an in-out referendum, far from being an act of\n\npolitical mastery, could prove to be Cameron's career-defining error.\n\n\n\nThe first reason is the bad timing. Why do this now? There is no imminent\n\nclimactic decision facing the EU. The terms of the post-eurozone crisis EU have\n\nyet to be set. There is an act of the UK parliament guaranteeing a yes-no vote\n\non any large treaty change. And Cameron does not know the outcome of the 2015\n\nelection: he may lead a Tory majority government after 2015, but he may face\n\nanother coalition. Cameron has made a rod for his own back because of a misread\n\nthreat from Ukip.\n\n\n\nYesterday's pledge does not settle the European issue in the Tory party either.\n\nOn the contrary. Everything is still to play for in the EU. Cameron has not said\n\nwhat his red lines are. He does not give details because he doesn't know the\n\nanswer. Nor does he know what is negotiable and what is not. And he cannot\n\nanswer the question that Labour's Douglas Alexander rightly keeps asking: what\n\nproportion of what you want would qualify as a victory that justified a yes - is\n\nit 50%, 70%, 90% or even 100%?\n\n\n\nThe referendum is five years away - a very long time. The coming vote will now\n\ninfect everything Cameron does. He may present an appearance of indifference to\n\nthe outcome - sure, stay in if we can, but hey, leave if we must. But his\n\npreference was clear. He wants Britain to stay in \"heart and soul\". These are\n\nstrong words. I assume he meant them. But they mean he cannot afford to lose. So\n\nevery large decision must now be judged according to whether it advances his\n\nchances of victory in 2018. Europe, meanwhile, knows it can play a tight game.\n\nCameron has bought himself five years of battles. And for what in return?\n\n\n\nThe second great reason for scepticism about Cameron's strategy is the\n\nlikelihood of its destructive impact on the Conservative party. Think ahead to\n\nthe four possible outcomes of the referendum he has now announced. None is\n\nwithout serious peril. If Cameron wins a stay-in vote in 2018, it will be a\n\npersonal triumph. But a substantial rump of Tory diehard anti-Europeans will be\n\ndevastated. They want the referendum because they want to leave the EU. They\n\nwill never vote to stay. They also despise Cameron. After an in vote they will\n\nno longer have a political raison d'etre. They could split the party to the\n\nright, and perhaps join Ukip, or worse.\n\n\n\nBut what if Cameron campaigns to stay in and loses? That would mean the end of\n\nhis career, the probable fall of the government and the likelihood of party\n\ncivil war. There would be no love lost between the Tories' in and out factions\n\non the day after Cameron lost the referendum. A split would again be likely, and\n\neven under Boris Johnson the Conservatives' chances of winning a new general\n\nelection would be fragile.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, what if an angry Cameron returns empty-handed from Berlin and\n\nfinds himself leading an out campaign to victory in the promised referendum? At\n\nleast some moderate Tories would be likely to defect to the centre immediately.\n\nBut this ultimate Eurosceptic triumph would quickly turn sour on the Tories.\n\nWithout Europe, they would have no one else to blame. The voters would soon get\n\nbuyer's remorse. Labour would immediately prosper. Electoral defeat and the\n\npolitical wilderness would beckon for the Tories.\n\n\n\nNow suppose, finally, that Cameron leads a get out campaign but is defeated. The\n\nvoters decide instead to stay in the EU against the advice of most of his party.\n\nThe government could not survive - and Labour might then be looking at a\n\n1997-style landslide in the unavoidable ensuing election.\n\n\n\nCameron's speech was not brave. It was reckless. The brave stance yesterday was\n\nEd Miliband's, sticking to Labour's practical pro-Europeanism and refusing to\n\nfollow suit. Instead, yesterday marks the moment when Cameron's pragmatic\n\ncentre-right political project finally bent the knee to the ideological fantasy\n\nabout Europe that still grips the Tory party. It was a step back towards a past\n\nfrom which Cameron once promised to lead his party. It was a step away from the\n\nelectoral middle ground of which he has always seemed a natural inhabitant. It\n\nis a big moment and, in its way, even a tragic one.\n\n\n\nmartin.kettle@guardian.co.uk\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela Merkel created a small breathing space for David Cameron yesterday when\n\nshe gave a guarded response to his landmark speech on Europe, paving the way for\n\nthe prime minister to campaign in favour of an in-out referendum on Britain's\n\nmembership of the EU at the next election.\n\n\n\nAs most European leaders rejected Cameron's demands for a radical overhaul of\n\nthe terms of Britain's EU membership, the German chancellor indicated she was\n\nopen to negotiating a \"fair compromise\".\n\n\n\nThe intervention by Merkel, hours after the prime minister called for Britain to\n\nbe exempted from the EU's founding objective to create \"an ever-closer union\",\n\ndelighted Downing Street which had worked hard to brief on Cameron's speech.\n\n\n\nHe outlined the scale of his ambition to transform the terms of Britain's\n\nmembership of the EU when he cast himself as a modern-day heretic ready to\n\nchallenge the defining declaration of the 1957 treaty of Rome which founded the\n\nEEC.\n\n\n\n\"We understand and respect the right of others to maintain their commitment to\n\nthis goal,\" he said of the commitment to forge an ever-closer union. \"But for\n\nBritain - and perhaps for others - it is not the objective. And we would be much\n\nmore comfortable if the treaty specifically said so, freeing those who want to\n\ngo further, faster, to do so, without being held back by the others.\"\n\n\n\nCameron did not set out his specific negotiating objectives but said \"nothing\n\nwas off the table\" as he set out a vision of a flexible Europe unlikely to find\n\nmany friends in Europe. He made clear he wanted repeal of the current working\n\nhours directive, a clawing back of EU powers in fields of environment, social\n\naffairs and crime, fewer EU commissioners and protection of UK rights in the\n\nsingle market as the eurozone members strengthen their co-operation.\n\n\n\nHis demands will be tabled in negotiations if he wins the 2015 general election.\n\nA new settlement would then be put to voters in a referendum by the end of 2017.\n\n\n\n\"I believe in confronting this issue - shaping it, leading the debate,\" he told\n\nan audience at the London headquarters of Bloomberg. \"Not simply hoping a\n\ndifficult situation will go away.\"\n\n\n\nThe speech delighted Tory MPs across the party, on a temporary basis at least,\n\nand prompted Ed Miliband to harden his position when he rejected an in-out\n\nreferendum on the terms proposed by Cameron, riling some of his frontbench team.\n\nBut Tony Blair led an immediate fightback by pro-Europeans when he likened the\n\nspeech to the scene in the Mel Brooks film Blazing Saddles where the sheriff\n\npoints a gun at his own head.\n\n\n\nMerkel gave a guarded response in which she was careful not to reject Cameron's\n\ndemands out of hand. \"Germany, and I personally, want Britain to be an important\n\npart and an active member of the European Union,\" she said. \"We are prepared to\n\ntalk about British wishes but we must always bear in mind that other countries\n\nhave different wishes and we must find a fair compromise.\"\n\n\n\nGerman officials made clear Merkel's words were chosen to ensure Berlin would\n\nnot block Cameron from placing a referendum commitment in the 2015 Tory\n\nmanifesto. But Berlin remains sceptical of the Tories' tactics and is likely to\n\nfight any British attempt to gain a competitive advantage in the single market.\n\n\n\nEU diplomats and officials said Merkel, who is keen to keep Britain in the EU,\n\nwould drive the hardest of bargains amid acute concern that Cameron had plunged\n\nthe EU into years of uncertainty when the paramount priority for the others is\n\nto recover from the euro crisis.\n\n\n\nOther EU leaders lined up to declare there would be no \"cherry-picking\", nor \"a\n\nla carte\" terms tailored to suit the British. Cameron's only whole-hearted\n\nbacking came from the prime minister of the Czech Republic while his allies, the\n\nprime ministers of Sweden and the Netherlands, sat on the fence.\n\n\n\nThe French president, Francois Hollande, told his cabinet in Paris that being an\n\nEU member \"brought obligations\", according to an Elysee Palace spokeswoman. The\n\nFrench foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said: \"You can't do Europe a la carte,\"\n\nadding mischievously that Paris would roll out the red carpet to fleeing UK\n\nbusinesses if Britain quit the EU. \"I'll take an example which our British\n\nfriends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join.\n\nOnce you're in it you can't say: 'Let's play rugby'.\"\n\n\n\nCameron, who was greeted by ecstatic Tory MPs waving their order papers as he\n\narrived for prime minister's questions, won overwhelming support from the 1922\n\ncommittee last night.\n\n\n\nBut senior figures warned that the unity could break down if France and Germany\n\npress ahead with plans to create new governance arrangements for the eurozone\n\nbefore the 2015 general election. Cameron is banking on a delay in any major\n\nrevision of the Lisbon treaty until after the election after Nick Clegg\n\ndismissed his strategy yesterday. One senior Tory warned that up to 20% of the\n\nparty will campaign for a no vote if the prime minister achieves only \"token\"\n\nconcessions in any negotiation.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nCameron said a referendum on Britain's EU membership would be held after 2015\n\nPhotograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/ EPA\n\n\n\n",

Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.\"\n\n\n\nAimed at mainstream Eurosceptics\n\n\n\nsuch as Andrea Leadsom MP (pictured)\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron took a giant step in mending fences with a large number of\n\nConservative MPs who were upset when he imposed a three-line whip in October\n\n2011 opposing a referendum on Britain's EU membership. A total of 81 Tory MPs\n\nrebelled. Mark Pritchard, one of the rebel ringleaders, welcomed the speech when\n\nhe tweeted: \"Congratulation to the prime minister on becoming the 82nd Tory\n\nrebel. We're all in this together!\"\n\n\n\n\"I understand the impatience of wanting to make that choice (on continued\n\nmembership) immediately. But I don't believe that to make a decision at this\n\nmoment is the right way forward, either for Britain or for Europe as a whole. A\n\nvote today between the status quo and leaving would be an entirely false\n\nchoice.\"\n\n\n\nAimed at hardline Eurosceptics\n\n\n\nThere is such mistruct between Downing Street and some hardline Eurosceptics\n\nthat No 10 was bracing itself for criticism for its plan to delay the referendum\n\nfor five years. The Tory MEP Dan Hannan (right), who wants Britain to leave the\n\nEU and who has led calls for a referendum, was delighted. But the MP John Baron,\n\nwho persuaded 100 colleagues to sign a letter last year calling for a referendum\n\n, said the prime minister should legislate for the referendum now.\n\n\n\n\"If we don't address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and\n\nthe British people will drift towards the exit. I do not want that to happen. I\n\nwant the European Union to be a success. And I want a relationship between\n\nBritain and the EU that keeps us in it.\"\n\n\n\nAimed at pro-Europeans\n\n\n\nThe prime minister believes he is doing pro-Europeans a favour by addressing\n\n\"public disillusionment\" with the EU in a way that could stabilise Britain's\n\nposition in the EU. He believes that a major repatriation of powers would\n\naddress the democratic consent for the EU which he described as \"wafer thin\".\n\nKenneth Clarke, who told the FT recently that referendums are usually proposed\n\nby \"hangers and floggers\", will give his response next week.\n\n\n\n\"I say to our European partners, frustrated as some of them no doubt are by\n\nBritain's attitude: work with us on this . . . Just as I believe that Britain\n\nshould want to remain in the EU so the EU should want us to stay\"\n\n\n\nAimed at European leaders\n\n\n\nHe made a point of briefing Angela Merkel and other EU leaders on his speech. He\n\nwants to make clear to Britain's 26 EU partners that his plan to repatriate\n\npowers, to be endorsed in a referendum, is not a hostile act. A successful\n\nnegotiation would lead to a great prize: settled British membership of the EU.\n\n\n\n\"We would have to think carefully too about the impact on our influence at the\n\ntop table of international affairs. There is no doubt that we are more powerful\n\nin Washington, in Beijing, in Delhi because we are a powerful player in the\n\nEuropean Union\"\n\n\n\nAimed at Barack Obama\n\n\n\nCameron knows that the US believes Britain should remain an influential member\n\nof the EU because Washington believes European integration is the best way of\n\nensuring stability on the continent that has caused it such grief. US interests\n\nalso lie in ensuring that such a staunch ally can influence the EU.\n\n\n\n\"We should also remember how the shift in Europe from war to sustained peace\n\ncame about.

Obama reiterated in the run-up to re-election in November\n\nlast year that a focus on the Pacific remained one of his priorities.\n\n\n\nBut his position on Europe has softened over the last four years, seeing a value\n\nin an alliance that saw European engagement in various troublespots, primarily\n\nFrance and Britain taking a lead in Libya.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Obama administration pays lip-service to the \"special\n\nrelationship\", it has forged closer ties with Germany, to the chagrin of\n\nBritain.\n\n\n\nMatthias Matthijs, Washington-based assistant professor and European specialist\n\nat the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University,\n\nsaid: \"I think the Americans are greatly frustrated with all this UK fickleness\n\non Europe.\"\n\n\n\nThere was no official response from the Chinese government yesterday, but\n\nexperts there said the spectre of a 2017 in-out referendum could damage Sino-UK\n\neconomic relations and unsettle Chinese business leaders who have come to rely\n\non Britain as a key player in Sino-EU trade.\n\n\n\nThe EU is China's largest trading partner - the two economies trade over Â£840m\n\nper day - and as such, China's regional economic allegiances are clear. \"If the\n\nUK really exits the European Union, this will create some uncertainties for\n\nChinese business leaders,\" said Gary Liu, a professor at the China Europe\n\nInternational Business School in Shanghai. Withdrawal, he added, could \"create\n\nactual cost for Chinese people to do business in Europe.\"\n\n\n\nChinese foreign policy officials would perceive a split between the UK and the\n\nEU as a possible harbinger of closer ties between UK and the US - not a\n\nChina-friendly development, given a recent surge of distrust in Sino-US affairs.\n\n\"We all know that Great Britain is a special ally of the United States, and\n\nGreat Britain is also a very important country in the European Union,\" said Shi\n\nYinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.\n\n\"But if you abandon (the latter) identity, you will only have one identity in\n\nChinese eyes.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Miliband yesterday risked alienating some voters, and unnerving sections of\n\nhis own shadow cabinet, when he stood firm, saying he was opposed to an in-out\n\nreferendum on the terms proposed by David Cameron.\n\n\n\nThe Tories seized on his statement, claiming he was against an in-out referendum\n\n, but Miliband's aides said the party only opposed a referendum now.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Conservatives were confident that the Labour leader had made a\n\ndisastrous political error for which he would pay a price at the next election.\n\nGrant Shapps, the Conservative chairman, said: \"It's clear that Labour doesn't\n\ntrust the British public to have their say on their country's future.\"\n\n\n\nBut those senior members of the shadow cabinet that would have preferred a\n\nclearer pro-referendum line bit their lips, saying the option remained open.\n\nOthers claimed Cameron would enjoy a short-term hit, but that the speech would\n\nnot age well. Some senior backbenchers such as Keith Vaz, the home affairs\n\nselect committee chairman and a former Europe minister, openly called for a\n\nreferendum, but surprisingly few Labour voices called for Miliband to follow\n\nCameron.\n\n\n\nThose most sympathetic to a referendum forced a shadow cabinet discussion a\n\nfortnight ago to tilt the party's European policy - to make it clearer that\n\nLabour would keep its options open on a referendum, and not appear to be\n\nadvocates of a status quo in Europe. That view was reflected in Miliband's\n\nrecent broadcast interviews and the definitive speech to Chatham House delivered\n\nby the shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander.\n\n\n\nAmong those pushing this stance were shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, and the head\n\nof the party's policy review, Jon Cruddas, an unabashed advocate of a referendum\n\n.\n\n\n\nAlthough there are different attitudes to Europe inside the Labour leadership,\n\nthere is little of the visceral hatred found in the Conservative party and the\n\ndebate is as much about political tactics as anything. One source said: \"It\n\ndepends how important Europe becomes in the election. As Lord Ashcroft's polling\n\nshows, it is not that important with most voters, but if the issue of whether a\n\nparty is holding a referendum or not becomes important, then that becomes a\n\nproblem for us.\"\n\n\n\nSince the shadow cabinet discussion, Miliband has emphasised that Labour has\n\nsupported the legal lock passed in the 2011 European Union Act that requires a\n\nreferendum if there is a transfer of powers from Westminster to Brussels.\n\n\n\nLawyers dispute precisely when that referendum might be triggered by the act,\n\nbut it is agreed an increase in majority voting at EU level, so reducing\n\nnational sovereignty, would require a referendum.\n\n\n\nIf Miliband found himself in a serious political hole on the need to offer a\n\nreferendum, it would be possible for him - in 12 to 18 months' time - to say\n\nevents in Europe show there will be a transfer of sovereignty and so a\n\nreferendum is required. Miliband would be seen to be awkwardly following the\n\nlead of Cameron, but that is not politically disastrous.\n\n\n\nThe current position has allowed most of the big pro-European voices - Miliband,\n\nAlexander, Balls, Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson - to unite around the argument\n\nthat it is damaging to the British economic interest to put a five-year question\n\nmark over membership of the single market.\n\n\n\nBlair said yesterday: \"I think it's a huge worry in circumstances where you put\n\non the agenda the prospect of Britain leaving. Why would we do that? We don't\n\nyet know what we are proposing or what we can get negotiated. We don't yet know\n\nwhat the rest of Europe is going to propose. I don't believe in a referendum\n\nunless it's necessary to do it. This referendum will happen in four or five\n\nyears' time.\"\n\n\n\nHe said that, as a tactic, \"it reminds me a bit of the Mel Brooks comedy Blazing\n\nSaddles where the sheriff says at one point during it - holds a gun to his own\n\nhead and says, 'If you don't do what I want, I'll blow my brains out'. You know,\n\nyou want to watch that one of the 26 (other EU states) don't just say, 'Well OK,\n\ngo ahead.'\"\n\n\n\nAlexander questioned Cameron's timing and motive, pointing out: \"There are no\n\nchanges being considered in the eurozone that impact on British sovereignty and,\n\nif there are any changes that lead to a transfer of power from Britain to\n\nBrussels, then according to the law we already have on the statute book that\n\nwould automatically trigger a referendum.\"\n\n\n\nHe said he supported changes to the EU but added: \"The idea that you put a gun\n\nto the head of your EU partners and stand in the departure lounge shouting at 26\n\nother members of European Union as the way to get those changes does not make\n\nsense to me\".\n\n\n\nMandelson, who is one of many pointing out Europe can help to restore Labour's\n\nrelationship with business, said Cameron's speech was \"about pleasing a party\n\naudience and the people who he used to call the fruitcakes and headbangers\".\n\n\n\nMiliband's stance has the additional benefit of being almost identical to that\n\nof Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, so giving both parties some mutual political\n\ncover.\n\n\n\nClegg said: \"The priority of the Liberal Democrats is to build a stronger\n\neconomy in a fairer society. Now, that job is made all the harder if we have\n\nyears of grinding uncertainty because of an ill-defined, protracted\n\nrenegotiation of Britain's status within the European Union.\n\n\n\n\"My priority remains, and will always remain: yes, reform in Europe; yes, a\n\nreferendum where the circumstances are right, as we've set out in law; but,\n\nabove and beyond anything else, promoting growth and jobs.\"\n\n\n\nThe similarity of the two leaders' stances is not lost on those that look\n\nforward to the prospect of another hung parliament. If the voters give him a\n\ngenuine choice of parties in 2015, is Clegg more likely to join forces with\n\nCameron, with his ambitious plan to negotiate European optouts until November\n\n2017, or Miliband?\n\n\n\n",

He warned\n\nthat the promise of a referendum in 2017 would make businesses less likely to\n\ninvest.\n\n\n\n\"A referendum adds to uncertainty - it doesn't diminish uncertainty,\" Sorrell\n\nsaid. \"I understand the PM's predicament.

If I am looking at it from WPP, it isn't good news.\"\n\n\n\nSorrell fears Britain could \"say no and move out at precisely the wrong time\",\n\nwhen the tough measures being taken by the eurozone are bearing fruit.\n\n\n\nPeter Sands, chief executive of Standard Chartered bank, told Bloomberg TV: \"My\n\nfeeling is that the UK needs to remain part of the EU. I completely understand\n\nwhy prime minister Cameron thought it necessary to offer the people a referendum\n\n. Europe is changing, and as the biggest country in Europe outside the eurozone,\n\nthe UK's relationship with the eurozone is going to change.\"\n\n\n\nHe added: \"The European Union has been a massively important creation within\n\nEurope. It is very good for the UK to be part of it. It will evolve. We have\n\nseen that already in the eurozone. It is changing quite markedly.

The prime minister is trying to shape the agenda\n\nrather than things happening as a result of drift and by default,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCheshire was one of 55 business figures who signed a letter to the Times\n\nwelcoming Cameron's move as \"a European policy that will be good for business\n\nand good for good jobs in Britain.\"\n\n\n\nThe CBI, mindful of the fact that its membership has widely different views\n\nabout Europe, is adopting a cautious approach to Cameron's speech.\n\n\n\nSir Roger Carr, the president of the CBI, said: \"The tone, the style and the\n\nemphasis of the speech, which was positive about European membership, was good\n\nnews.\n\n\n\n\"But the referendum builds in a degree of uncertainty and business never\n\nwelcomes uncertainty.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nSir Martin Sorrell: 'I understand the PM's predicament.

He takes things he wants in Europe but refuses what he\n\ndoesn't\", said the 68-year-old cultural consultant at the Pompidou Centre. \"In\n\nEurope, he thinks, every country is below Britain.

There are people in France who don't\n\nknow where Europe is going. We don't even know where we are going with the\n\nsocialist government because a lot of people are running away from France,\n\nparticularly those with money. I am sure if there was a referendum in France\n\nnow, no (to EU membership) would win.\"\n\n\n\nCohen, 54, returning to Paris with his wife, Jacqueline, maintained French\n\npeople had already shown they had not \"wanted Europe\" in a referendum held by\n\nPresident Jacques Chirac on the European constitution in 2005.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron won overwhelming support last night from the Conservative 1922\n\nbackbench committee when MPs from across the party rallied behind his pledge to\n\nhold an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017.\n\n\n\nTory pro-Europeans, Eurosceptics and opponents of the EU praised Cameron for\n\nspelling out in clear terms the exact timing of the referendum in 2017 and the\n\nform it will take - a straightforward in-out choice.\n\n\n\nBernard Jenkin, the veteran Eurosceptic, told the Guardian: \"This is a very\n\nsignificant moment. The commitment to the referendum is historic. There are\n\nunanswered questions but nothing should dwarf the significance of this. The\n\nspeech sets out some very important principles about the importance of national\n\nparliaments, the importance of legitimacy and the repudiation of ever closer\n\nunion is very significant.\"\n\n\n\nBehind the shows of unity, however, senior Conservatives issued a series of\n\nwarnings to Downing Street last night about the pitfalls for Cameron over the\n\nnext five years.\n\n\n\nIan Birrell, his former speechwriter, described the speech in a blog on the\n\nConservativeHome website as \"padding wrapped around a stick of political\n\ndynamite\". Writing of Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum, Birrell\n\nsaid: \"Mr Cameron has been forced to concede possibly the biggest gamble of his\n\nprime ministerial career. This is not throwing a slab of red meat to the right -\n\nit is giving them the keys to the abattoir.\"\n\n\n\nSenior Eurosceptics illustrated Birrell's point by signalling when they made\n\nclear that the party would split, with up to 20% of its MPs campaigning for a no\n\nvote in the referendum, if the prime minister wins only \"token\" concessions in a\n\nrenegotiation of Britain's membership terms.\n\n\n\nOne Tory said: \"If the prime minister does a token renegotiation and comes back\n\nand says: 'Well I've got hospital doctors off the hook' and it is a great game\n\nset and match - a John Major situation with Maastricht - most of the\n\nConservative party would go awol. The Conservative party is happy that we are\n\ngetting a vote but it is not focusing on what the substance of the position will\n\nbe.\"\n\n\n\nOne prominent pro-European took a different view as he hailed the speech as a\n\nsign of the prime minister's commitment to the EU. Robert Buckland tweeted: \"A\n\nclear and passionate commitment to continued EU membership from @David-Cameron.\n\nBritain has a vital role to play in Europe.\"\n\n\n\nLord Ashcroft, the former Tory deputy chairman, warned that the party could\n\nactually diminish its chances of winning the 2015 general election if it allows\n\nEurope to dominate its campaign. Ashcroft wrote on the ConservativeHome website:\n\n\"Tories must remember that we can only get what we want once we win an election.\n\nThe more we talk about changing our relationship with Europe, the less likely it\n\nis to happen.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister is aware that the path towards the referendum will not be\n\neasy. While he is an instinctive Eurosceptic he knows the dangers of allowing\n\nthe party to be defined by Europe after he was first elected to parliament in\n\nthe party's disastrous 2001 election which was dominated by William Hague's Keep\n\nthe Pound campaign. In his first party conference speech as leader in 2006,\n\nCameron famously said: \"While parents worried about childcare, getting the kids\n\nto school, balancing work and family life - we were banging on about Europe.\"\n\n\n\nBut Cameron left Downing Street for the World Economic Forum in Davos with two\n\nclear thoughts. First, he believes Ed Miliband walked into a trap by rejecting\n\nhis in-out referendum, a position Labour compounded by suggesting that this was\n\nnot definitive. Second, he believes the party will be broadly united over Europe\n\nin the run up, and through, the 2015 general election.\n\n\n\nOne senior Eurosceptic, who was consulted by Cameron as he finalised his speech,\n\nsaid: \"The prime minister ticked a series of boxes in his speech. No to ever\n\ncloser union - tick. Yes to a clear in-out referendum - tick. Yes to a return to\n\na common market - tick. And finally - how to be on the wrong side of history by\n\nE. Miliband.\"\n\n\n\nThe breadth of opinion was reflected by one Tory who expects to campaign for a\n\nno vote. \"When I heard that the prime minister would say he will hold an in-out\n\nreferendum twice I thought fine - that's all we need.\"\n\n\n\nJenkin warned Britain would face a long haul in difficult negotiations. \"It is\n\nvery significant that the prime minister has been explicit that (the referendum)\n\nis in on the new terms or out. But there is a long way to go before we get to\n\nthat point. An awful lot of hypotheticals are being asked about what the\n\nposition of the party might be at that point which the prime minister would find\n\nvery difficult to answer.\"\n\n\n\n",

But the shake-it-all-about bit\n\nwill come first. He is going to tell the sclerotic, overpaid, misguided\n\nfunctionaries of Brussels that there are too many sclerotic, overpaid, misguided\n\nfunctionaries in Brussels. That'll shake 'em all about!\n\n\n\nMr Cameron announced this bid for British independence at Bloomberg, a huge US\n\nfinancial news service. Its European operation is in a futuristic building in\n\nLondon. Like all futuristic structures, it's beginning to look dated. Weird\n\nlights and slogans run across the floors. There is a vast aquarium of colour\n\nco-ordinated fish. In the atrium, 888 multi-coloured spheres light up as\n\nemployees log in to their computers. It's the modern equivalent of clocking on:\n\n\"Your sphere was late lighting up this morning, Perkins. Flu again, or another\n\nof your hangovers?\"\n\n\n\nOn giant screens around the building, Bloomberg TV pumped live coverage from the\n\nWorld Economic Forum in Davos, so that the myrmidons could learn the opinions of\n\npeople who actually matter, unlike elected politicians.\n\n\n\nBut it was elected politicians to whom the prime minister was speaking. It\n\nsounded - and he is good at this kind of reasonable,\n\ngosh-who-could-possibly-disagree-with-that? speech - as if it were addressed to\n\nnormal people. In fact it was aimed at the Tory Hell's Angels who are giving him\n\nsuch a hard time. They must feel like dysfunctional schoolboys who tweet that\n\nthey're going to bomb the airport, then watch with delight as two dozen fire\n\nengines and a Swat team scream up.\n\n\n\nCertainly, four hours later at prime minister's questions, they greeted Cameron\n\nwith massive cheering and waving of order papers, like Bradford fans watching\n\ntheir team beat Aston Villa. I noticed only a minority were making the most\n\nnoise. They loved his clear unequivocal message: \"We are going to leave Europe,\n\nunless we decide to stay!\"\n\n\n\nAs always with a Cameron speech, there are the oddities that bring you up short\n\neven while it flows past you, as if a few inflatable ducks had been dropped into\n\nan Olympic swimming pool. \"The biggest danger to the EU comes . . . from those\n\nwho denounce new thinking as heresy. Europe has experience of heretics who\n\nturned out to have a point!\"\n\n\n\nWas he comparing himself to the great heretics? Was he Dave Galileo, murmuring\n\nthat the Earth does go round the sun?\n\n\n\nChanging the British mindset - we are an island nation - would be harder than\n\n\"draining the English channel\". But, you think, you can't drain the English\n\nchannel. It wouldn't work! And as you ponder that, you miss his animadversions\n\non the role of Britain in Europe (which turned out to be largely thrashing the\n\nFrench and the Germans).\n\n\n\nSuddenly he was denouncing \"fast lanes and slow lanes, and countries missing\n\ntrains and buses\". It was time to \"consign the whole weary caravan of metaphors\n\nto a permanent siding!\" So cramming more weary caravans onto one railway track.\n\nGot that?\n\n\n\nIn the Commons, he abused Ed Miliband for not saying if he would support the\n\nin-out referendum, even after Miliband had said he was agin it. This was getting\n\nsurreal. The Labour leader wanted the PM to promise that he himself would vote\n\nto stay in, whatever. Cameron said he wanted to stay in but wouldn't promise\n\nbecause that would give away his negotiating stance.\n\n\n\nBut we can guess what will happen. The EU leaders will give him some small\n\nconcessions - he's already bragging about new trade ties with Singapore - and he\n\nwill bring them back to us like Drake presenting to Elizabeth galleons rammed\n\nwith Spanish gold.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the radio Tony Blair was comparing Cameron to the sheriff in\n\nBlazing Saddles who says: \"If you don't do what I want, I'll blow my brains\n\nout!\"\n\n\n\nBut there is an even more famous scene in that film. All the cowboys sit round\n\nthe campfire eating beans and farting at each other. Now that's the Tory party!\n\n\n\n",

It will be an in-out referendum.\n\n\n\n\"Legislation will be drafted before the next election. And if a Conservative\n\ngovernment is elected we will introduce the enabling legislation immediately and\n\npass it by the end of that year. And we will complete this negotiation and hold\n\nthis referendum within the first half of the next parliament.\n\n\n\n\"It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this\n\nEuropean question in British politics.\"\n\n\n\nLast night, Labour leader Ed Miliband said Cameron's speech would \"define him as\n\na weak prime minister, being driven by his party, not by the national economic\n\ninterest\".\n\n\n\nProminent pro-Europeans are planning to lambast Cameron for placing a question\n\nmark over Britain's EU membership. One senior figure said: \"This is dynamite.\n\nThis is such a risk - it is an all or nothing strategy.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on a relatively short\n\ntimetable is the \"red meat\" which has prompted prominent Eurosceptics, such as\n\nthe former defence secretary Liam Fox, to express satisfaction with the speech.\n\n\n\nNo 10 insists the prime minister is not adopting hostile tactics towards the EU,\n\nalthough some pro-Europeans suggested that Cameron had crossed a line by\n\nappearing to use the threat of a referendum within a relatively short timetable\n\nto strengthen Britain's hand in the negotiations.\n\n\n\nCameron will make clear to his 26 fellow EU leaders that a failure to offer\n\nBritain a referendum on new membership terms would increase the chance of a\n\nBritish exit. \"The question mark is already there and ignoring it won't make it\n\ngo away,\" he will say. \"In fact, quite the reverse. Those who refuse to\n\ncontemplate consulting the British people, would in my view make more likely our\n\neventual exit.\"\n\n\n\nNick Clegg, who has been briefed by the prime minister on the speech, will\n\nreject Cameron's pledge to hold a referendum by 2017 on the grounds that it is\n\nwrong to commit Britain to such a specific timetable when there is uncertainty\n\nover whether negotiations will take place. The deputy prime minister's\n\nopposition means that the draft legislation for the referendum will have to be\n\ndrawn up by Conservative special advisers outside the formal government and\n\nparliamentary routes.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister's plans, which will involve tabling new British membership\n\nterms in a future EU treaty negotiation designed to agree new eurozone\n\ngovernance structures, may have run into trouble even before he delivers his\n\nspeech. Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande agreed at a summit in Berlin\n\nyesterday to publish joint proposals for the running of the eurozone at an EU\n\nsummit in June.\n\n\n\nThe move by the leaders of Germany and France means negotiations could take\n\nplace earlier than No 10 had expected. The prime minister will be unable to\n\ntable his demands for the repatriation of powers before the next election\n\nbecause Clegg has dismissed this strategy as \"a false promise wrapped in a union\n\njack\".\n\n\n\nThe Franco-German timetable also raises the prospect that the negotiations could\n\ntake place outside a formal EU treaty revision. German sources have indicated in\n\nrecent weeks that Merkel has abandoned plans for the moment to demand a revision\n\nof the Lisbon treaty in the face of strong opposition across the EU,\n\nparticularly from Paris.\n\n\n\nThe PM, who has briefed Hollande and Merkel on his speech, is understood to have\n\naccepted that he may have to table his demands outside a formal treaty\n\nnegotiation. This raises the prospect that he could follow in the footsteps of\n\nHarold Wilson who negotiated small changes to Britain's EU membership terms\n\noutside the treaties ahead of the 1975 referendum.\n\n\n\nCameron will make clear in his speech that he will be demanding major changes,\n\npossibly including the repatriation of social and employment laws which could\n\nsee Britain winning a complete opt-out from the working time directive. Downing\n\nStreet sources have suggested that work is now complete on plans by Theresa May,\n\nthe home secretary, to restrict benefits to EU citizens who are entitled to\n\nsettle in Britain.\n\n\n\nDowning Street insists the prime minister's goal is to strengthen Britain's\n\nposition in the EU by winning greater support through renegotiated membership\n\nterms. But he will indicate that he may countenance a campaign for a no vote, if\n\nhe fails to win his demands, when he says the status quo is unacceptable.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a year of prevarication through 2012, David Cameron today finally adopts\n\nthe negotiating stance of Liam Fox, his former defence secretary and perhaps the\n\nmost senior Eurosceptic on the backbenches. The prime minister's call for an\n\nin-out referendum is a moment of truth for a pragmatic man assumed to be\n\ninstinctively opposed to political risk.\n\n\n\nThrough the first half of 2012, Cameron had dodged and weaved in the face of a\n\n100-strong letter from his backbenchers demanding he pass legislation in this\n\nparliament preparing for a referendum on membership in the next parliament.\n\n\n\nHe lit the touchpaper with loosely chosen words at a press conference in\n\nBrussels on 29 June when he said: \"The problem with an in-out referendum is it\n\nactually only gives people those two choices: you can either stay in with all\n\nthe status quo, or you can get out. Most people in Britain, I think, want a\n\ngovernment that stands up and fights for them in Europe, and gets the things we\n\nwant in Europe, that changes some of the relationship we have in Europe.\"\n\n\n\nThen in a landmark article on 30 June last year, Fox struck, arguing against an\n\nimmediate in-out referendum, but saying: \"I would like to see Britain negotiate\n\na new relationship on the basis that, if we achieved it and our future\n\nrelationship was economic rather than political, we would advocate acceptance in\n\na referendum of this new dynamic . . . For my own part, life outside the EU\n\nholds no terror.\"\n\n\n\nAlmost simultaneously, Cameron wrote: \"As we get closer to the end point, we\n\nwill need to consider how best to get the full-hearted support of the British\n\npeople whether it is in a general election or in a referendum. For me the two\n\nwords 'Europe' and 'referendum' can go together\". From that point, the Eurogenie\n\nwas out the bottle.\n\n\n\nYet on 18 July, in a Daily Telegraph interview, Cameron insisted he did not want\n\nBritain ever to leave the EU. He said: \"When I look at what is in our national\n\ninterest we are not some country that looks in on ourself or retreats from the\n\nworld. Britain's interest - trading a vast share of our GDP - is to be in those\n\nmarkets. Not just buying, selling, investing, receiving investment but also\n\nhelping to write the rules. If we were outside, we would not be able to do that.\n\nIt comes back to this - who are going to be the winning nations of the 21st\n\ncentury? If your vision of Britain was that we should just withdraw and become a\n\nsort of Greater Switzerland, that would be a complete denial of our national\n\ninterests\".\n\n\n\nYet if he was to achieve his aim of a new relationship with the EU, he had to\n\ninject credibility into his demand for that renegotiation, and the only way to\n\ndo that is to suggest Britain could leave the EU if he does not get his way.\n\n\n\nIn his speech today, he makes it crystal clear that following the negotiations\n\nhe hopes to hold with his EU partners by the autumn of 2017, he will indeed be\n\nholding an in-out referendum. If he believes he has failed to renegotiate\n\nadequate terms, he will have to recommend Britain leaves the EU. Equally if he\n\nrecommends the terms, and the British people reject them, he will have to say\n\n\"very well, alone\".\n\n\n\nHis plan has many pitfalls. His Lib Dem colleagues will have no hand in drafting\n\nthe referendum legislation he intends to prepare before the election. Vince\n\nCable, the business secretary, has already denounced Cameron's timing as\n\ndisastrous. The sceptics will say \"if not now, when ?\" Cable will ask, why now\n\nin the midst of a recession?\n\n\n\nBritish business could unfurl the flag of revolt. They might blame every job\n\nlost between now and his referendum on the foolishness of Cameron in putting\n\nparty management before the national interest. More difficult, Angela Merkel and\n\nFrancois Hollande may not oblige by operating to the timetable Cameron has set\n\nout. They could hold their treaty revision to strengthen Euro-governance after\n\nthe German elections this autumn, but before Cameron is ready in 2017. They\n\ncould deprive Cameron of a lever into a renegotiation by saying the changes can\n\nbe made outside the EU institutions.\n\n\n\nThey could make the cold-hearted judgment that a strong Europe, including\n\nBritain, is an impossible fusion, and it is best the two sides to part more in\n\nsorrow than anger.\n\n\n\nBut he will argue Britain has to have this reckoning. If he does not renegotiate\n\nthe terms of Britain's membership, the British people will demand departure, so\n\nthis is the best way to secure Britain's membership. One thing is sure, he will\n\nhope he again secures the bond of trust with his own backbenchers, at least\n\nuntil they demand specifics on the powers he will repatriate.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nCameron had dodged the EU issue for a long time but raised it in a speech in\n\nJune and it has not gone away since\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron has clawed back ground from Labour, whose lead over the Tories has\n\nbeen squeezed to five points, according to the latest Guardian/ICM poll.\n\n\n\nAfter three straight months when it held an eight-point lead, Labour has slipped\n\nback two points to stand at 38%. The Tories have inched up one to 33% and the\n\nLiberal Democrats have edged up two to 15%. Ukip has slipped back one to 6%,\n\nafter the record showing of 7% recorded by ICM in November and December.\n\n\n\nThe fall in support for Ukip comes after the political start to 2013 was\n\ndominated by debate in the buildup to the prime minister's scheduled speech on\n\nBritain's relations with Europe. Cameron will now deliver his speech in London\n\ntomorrow.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister is expected to say that, if elected with a majority at the\n\n2015 general election, he will offer people a referendum on renewed membership\n\nterms of the EU. These would be negotiated if eurozone leaders asked for a\n\nrevision of the Lisbon treaty to underpin new governance arrangements for the\n\neurozone.\n\n\n\nDowning Street believes the lengthy delay in the speech, during which\n\npro-Europeans have intensified their campaign, has worked to the benefit of the\n\nprime minister, who supports UK membership, though on revised terms. A\n\nYouGov/Sunday Times poll found that supporters of British membership of the EU,\n\nwho trailed opponents by 21 points in November, now enjoy a six-point lead.\n\n\n\nIf the new focus on foreign policy is playing well for the prime minister,\n\nhowever, the Guardian/ICM survey reveals gathering doubts about a key plank of\n\nthe government's strategy on the domestic front: the decoupling of benefits from\n\ninflation, which George Osborne announced in his autumn statement.\n\n\n\nICM asked voters to choose between two views of the chancellor's proposal for a\n\n1% cap on benefit rises. Just 36% agreed with his argument that \"squeezing\n\nbenefits is fair, as wages for workers are also being squeezed\", but 58%\n\ninclined to the case made by the opposition that squeezing benefits and tax\n\ncredits \"is unfair, as it will hurt the vulnerable, including many people who\n\nwork hard for low pay\".\n\n\n\nNo 10 has long been convinced that the \"striving\" majority of the public resents\n\nthe \"shirking\" minority who rely on welfare, and will thus be concerned that\n\nvoters reject its argument in favour of this latest social security cut by a\n\nsubstantial 22-point margin.\n\n\n\nPolls immediately before the autumn statement showed strong support for\n\nattaching stricter conditions to benefit payments.\n\n\n\nLast night, Stephen Timms, the shadow employment minister, committed Labour to\n\nuprating benefits in line with inflation. Speaking against the benefits uprating\n\nbill, he said: \"Uprating should be in line with inflation, as it always was in\n\nthe past.\"\n\n\n\nThe survey confirms a continuing gender gap, which will also concern No 10. The\n\nConservatives are one point ahead of Labour among men, by 36% to 35%, but among\n\nwomen they languish 16 points behind, 29% to 45%. But the Tories will draw\n\ncomfort from their strong showing among voters aged over 65, who are the most\n\nlikely to turn out to the polls. Among this group, the Conservatives are ahead\n\nof Labour by 39% to 30%.\n\n\n\nICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18+ on 18-20\n\nJanuary 2013. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have\n\nbeen weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British\n\nPolling Council and abides by its rules.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a reflection of disarray both within his own party and in the coalition\n\nthat David Cameron has virtually abdicated from the debate in Europe by\n\nadvocating a delay of four to five years in reaching any settlement. During this\n\ntime the eurozone could falter, UK inward investment fall, jobs disappear and\n\neconomic growth weaken still further. The sooner there is eurozone reform,\n\nmatched by a restructuring of the single market, the better.\n\n\n\nThe period after the forthcoming Italian elections and the German federal\n\nelections this September would be best to start a negotiating process of reform.\n\nA German government, perhaps a CDU/SPD coalition, will be ready to foot the bill\n\nfor helping vulnerable eurozone countries - provided others, particularly\n\nFrance, are ready to accept greater eurozone discipline. Cameron's timing is not\n\nprime ministerial but party political; no wonder President Obama and Chancellor\n\nMerkel have severe reservations about his position.\n\n\n\nIn reality Washington, Berlin and London have been as one in their analysis that\n\nto guarantee the eurozone's survival there has to be much greater economic and\n\npolitical integration amongst its member states. There is an inherent danger,\n\nhowever, for those countries not in the eurozone, such as the UK, that member\n\nstates could vote and act as a bloc in the single market, permanently overriding\n\nnon-eurozone countries on a qualified majority vote. This was first demanded in\n\na banking union. It could develop with fiscal union, perhaps even in a eurozone\n\nfinancial services union. And it could also lead to block voting on foreign,\n\nsecurity and defence policies. These are not remote possibilities but risks that\n\nwould face any government in 2015, Labour or Conservative.\n\n\n\nEurozone reform means the single market has to be restructured. It should\n\ninclude all EU and European Economic Area states, such as Norway and Iceland.\n\nTurkey, too, should be offered full membership. The key is to stop the single\n\nmarket requiring free movement of labour for all member states. Free movement\n\nrequires a country to reach levels of economic success and prosperity that make\n\nit far more likely their citizens will be content to remain within their own\n\nboundaries. In the next few months a prudent European commission would extend\n\nthe Romanian restriction on free movement from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\n\nEd Miliband would be fulfilling the spirit of one-nation Labour - words used not\n\njust by Disraeli but by Clement Attlee in Labour's 1945 manifesto - if he\n\ndeclared that his party would facilitate treaty amendments in their period in\n\nopposition and prior to becoming, as they hope, the next government.\n\n\n\nSome will ask why Labour should be so helpful to the government. The answer is\n\nthat, since the 1960s, all major decisions over Europe have been taken, by and\n\nlarge, through cross-party agreement. International treaties need cross-party\n\nsupport and Labour will need Conservative support when in power.\n\n\n\nLabour, through their friends in Europe, can play a crucial role in shaping\n\nEuropean social democrat policy towards reform, as can the Liberal Democrats in\n\ntheir party's European forum. Treaty amendment should not wait until 2015.\n\nLabour, Conservatives and Lib Dems can co-operate while remaining free to urge\n\nthe electorate to vote to stay in the single market or come out of the EU.\n\nMiliband, not unreasonably, wants to keep his options open for Labour's 2015\n\nmanifesto. Cameron has closed that option for his party by advocating a\n\nreferendum in the next parliament.\n\n\n\nI believe the people of this country want and deserve a referendum. They do not\n\ntrust politicians on Europe. But the crisis in Europe is too serious to be left\n\nuntil the next election. It has to be grappled with now. Ed Miliband has the\n\nchance to act as a statesman.\n\n\n\nLord Owen is the author of Europe Restructured\n\n\n\n",

Then a\n\nseparate speech was promised before Christmas. After eventually being scheduled\n\nfor last Friday in Amsterdam, it was postponed because of the Algerian crisis.\n\n\n\nWilliam Hague, the foreign secretary, said yesterday that the speech would take\n\nplace before the end of this week. The date and the time will be announced\n\ntoday.\n\n\n\nGiven that tomorrow and Thursday have apparently been ruled out and the\n\npublication of growth figures that could show Britain heading back towards\n\nrecession are due to be published on Friday, Wednesday seems the most likely\n\nday.\n\n\n\nSome extracts have been released from the speech, which will set out Cameron's\n\ndetermination to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and to put the\n\nresult to the people in a referendum after the 2015 election. But it remains to\n\nbe seen what he will say about the extent of the renegotiation he hopes to\n\nachieve or the mechanics of the proposed referendum.\n\n\n\nIn an interview on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Fox, who said that he was bound by\n\na duty of confidentiality not to disclose the contents of the speech, said he\n\npersonally wanted to see Britain revert to a \"basic economic relationship\" with\n\nthe EU.\n\n\n\nIf Cameron failed to achieve a major repatriation of powers, Fox said he would\n\nvote to leave the EU in the referendum that would follow.\n\n\n\n\"If the choice for me was between going in the current direction, which, let's\n\nface it, is towards ever closer union and ultimately a greater and greater loss\n\nof British sovereignty, my personal preference would be to leave,\" he said. \"I\n\ndon't want to have ever closer union, I don't want to be European first and\n\nBritish second.\"\n\n\n\nMichael Portillo, a leading Conservative Eurosceptic in the 1990s, told Sky News\n\nhe thought Cameron was making a mistake in offering a referendum when he\n\npersonally was in favour of keeping Britain in the EU. \"To commit himself to an\n\nin-out referendum in the midterm of his next government seems to me to be\n\nextraordinarily dangerous,\" said Portillo. \"People like to kick their government\n\nin the teeth.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nLiam Fox says he is 'broadly satisfied' with the draft of David Cameron's\n\nspeech, which is finally due to be given this week\n\n\n\n",

The\n\npostponement was announced shortly before the prime minister was due to fly to\n\nmeet the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, before his speech in Amsterdam.\n\n\n\nSome Tories were surprised that No 10 took so long to abandon the trip. Downing\n\nStreet had acknowledged the gravity of the crisis in Algeria yesterday morning\n\nby announcing that arrangements were being made for the prime minister to chair\n\na meeting of the emergency Cobra committee from The Hague today.\n\n\n\nEd Miliband, who was privately suggesting that the prime minister appeared to be\n\nputting the interests of Eurosceptics above his duties to deal with a security\n\ncrisis, had earlier said that the prime minister had spent six years preparing a\n\nspeech that will cause five years of uncertainty.\n\n\n\nCameron had been due to warn his fellow European leaders that British membership\n\nof the EU could be put at risk unless its terms were changed. \"If we don't\n\naddress these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British\n\npeople will drift towards the exit,\" Cameron was due to say in the speech to an\n\naudience of business leaders in Amsterdam.\n\n\n\n\"There is a growing frustration that the EU is seen as something that is done to\n\npeople rather than acting on their behalf.

Last night the White House made clear that the US\n\npresident maintained the pressure on Cameron in the call.\n\n\n\nCameron was due to declare that he will demand the repatriation of some powers\n\nif he wins an overall majority at the next election. The new terms of British\n\nmembership would then be put to the people in a referendum, possibly around\n\n2018.\n\n\n\n\"More of the same will not secure a long-term future for the eurozone. More of\n\nthe same will not see the EU keeping pace with the new powerhouse economies.\n\nMore of the same will not bring the EU any closer to its citizens. More of the\n\nsame will just produce more of the same - less competitiveness, less growth,\n\nfewer jobs,\" Cameron was due to say.\n\n\n\nBut he was given a taste of business leaders' unease when Sir Andrew Cahn, until\n\nrecently head of the government's main overseas trade body, UK Trade and\n\nInvestment, said: \"The chill factor is there, the nagging worry that the UK is\n\nretreating into inconsequential isolation.\"\n\n\n\nLord Browne, the former BP boss, said: \"Uncertainty is the enemy of investment,\n\nand we should be wary of doing anything which tarnishes Britain's reputation as\n\na home of choice for human and financial capital.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister was due to say that he supports British membership of the EU\n\nand that his aim is to stabilise support in Britain by addressing concerns about\n\npower amassed in Brussels. He wants to use a major revision of the Lisbon\n\ntreaty, which may take place after the European parliamentary elections in 2014,\n\nto table his demand for the repatriation of social and employment legislation.\n\n\n\nHe planned to identify the three major challenges facing Europe as the eurozone\n\ncrisis, weak competitiveness, and a lack of democratic accountability. Failure\n\nto address these would increase support among those who want to leave, though he\n\nwas due to say that is not his preference. \"I want the European Union to be a\n\nsuccess and I want a relationship between Britain and the EU that keeps us in\n\nit.\"\n\n\n\nUnease over his speech was illustrated in a warning from the president of the\n\nEuropean parliament. Martin Schulz, a German SPD MEP, wrote on the Huffington\n\nPost website that Cameron wanted to set a \"dangerous precedent\", which might\n\nlead to the \"breakup of the EU\".\n\n\n\nBut the prime minister last night won support from Boris Johnson. In remarks\n\nbriefed before the speech was cancelled, the London mayor said Cameron should\n\ntell the EU: \"We will allow you to use our common EU institutions - which we\n\nhelp fund - to pursue your project, if you help us with a renegotiation.

But it is easy to forget that we\n\nare also viewed by many as a gateway to the European Union. Uncertainty is the\n\nenemy of investment, and we should be wary of doing anything which tarnishes\n\nBritain's reputation as a home of choice for human and financial capital.\"\n\n\n\nAnticipation that the prime minister would announce that a future Conservative\n\ngovernment would renegotiate Britain's European treaty and put it to a popular\n\nvote was confirmed in press reports, despite the speech itself being cancelled\n\nas Cameron turned his attention to the Algeria hostage crisis.\n\n\n\nSome business leaders had welcomed Cameron's stance but others warned of a\n\n\"chill factor\" for foreign investors, of \"dangerous\" impacts on their business,\n\nand the risk of \"total destabilisation\" of the UK economy. Several said the\n\nchief threat to the UK - the No 1 overseas investment spot in the EU - was five\n\nyears of uncertainty caused by a pending referendum.\n\n\n\nSir Andrew Cahn, vice-chairman of the Japanese investment bank Nomura, spelt out\n\nhow potential investors might react: \"Imagine you are the CEO of a Korean car\n\nmanufacturer, or a Japanese electronics firm, or an American pharmaceutical\n\ncompany, or a Chinese bank. You have a billion dollar investment to make in\n\nEurope and the UK is your favoured location, as it would be half the time.\n\n\n\n\"Now your advisers say: we do not know if the UK will be in the single market in\n\nfive years' time and have no idea what their access terms will be. We do not\n\nknow if the UK will find a sustainable relationship with the EU or be endlessly\n\nfractious. Indeed, we have no idea what Britain's EU strategy is. As CEO, you\n\nare still tempted by Britain, but the balance changes and you examine the\n\nEuropean alternatives more closely.\n\n\n\n\"Whatever David Cameron says in his speech (now cancelled), much inward\n\ninvestment will still come here. But the chill factor is there, the nagging\n\nworry that the UK is retreating into inconsequential isolation. Why risk it?\"\n\n\n\nMartin Sorrell, chief executive of the global advertising and PR giant WPP,\n\nsaid: \"At the very best it (a referendum) will be neutral in impact; at the\n\nworst, negative on FDI (foreign direct investment).\"\n\n\n\nThese reactions were echoed by other key business figures who began speaking out\n\nyesterday. Last night ITV news reported that Sir Roger Carr, the Centrica\n\nchairman who is also chairman of the Confederation of British Industry, had told\n\nreporters that a stark in/out referendum on the EU would risk \"total\n\ndestabilisation\" of the British economy.\n\n\n\nWolfgang Schreiber, chief executive of German-owned Bentley motors, told the\n\nPress Association: \"It's acceptable for Britain to keep the pound while the\n\ncontinent has the euro. But quitting the EU could be dangerous for Bentley.\"\n\n\n\nSome voices, however, welcomed taking a tough approach to a new deal in Europe.\n\nJD Wetherspoon's chairman, Tim Martin, said the Europe-wide pub chain wanted\n\n\"proper democracy\" in EU countries, where accountable local politicians make\n\nlaws. \"The idea that we are in trouble if we repatriate democratic powers is\n\npiffle,\" Martin said. \"Let's restore full democracy in Britain and be great\n\nfriends with prosperous European countries, with whom we have a lot in common.\"\n\n\n\nAnd the British Chambers of Commerce said a referendum was essential to\n\nstrengthen the UK's hand in the negotiations which many want to see result in a\n\nrepatriatation of powers. \"We have to be prepared to walk away from the table .\n\n. . otherwise you're lost,\" said John Longworth, the chambers' director-general.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron: cancelled speech\n\n\n\n",

The\n\nbusiness secretary will warn: \"It will be difficult enough to safeguard UK\n\nnational interests in the single market in an environment where the UK stands\n\naside from closer economic and political integration in the eurozone. It could\n\nbecome next to impossible if the UK is simultaneously seeking to disengage from\n\nsubstantial existing commitments, especially if we are perceived to be blocking\n\ncloser integration in projects we are not part of.\n\n\n\n\"The Eurosceptic calculation is that British permission is necessary for closer\n\nintegration - via treaty change - and that this permission can be traded for the\n\nnegotiating objectives. That seems to me a dangerous gamble to make.\n\n\n\n\"There are many in Europe who would be happy to see the back of the UK -\n\nwhatever that may mean in practice - and even the UK's allies on market reform,\n\nnotably Germany, have limited political capital to spend getting a more\n\nfavourable arrangement for the UK.\"\n\n\n\nCable will say it is legitimate for Britain to seek reforms, but this process\n\n\"is not helped by threats to walk out when we don't get our way\".\n\n\n\nHe concedes that a referendum could \"lance the boil of suspicion that British\n\nmembership is primarily supported by a deracinated Europhile elite disconnected\n\nfrom and distrustful of the public\".\n\n\n\nBut he will add: \"What is clear is that this is a terrible time to have the\n\ndiversion and uncertainty which build up to a referendum would entail.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nVince Cable: 'Many in Europe would be happy to see the back of the UK'\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIf history repeats itself, first as tragedy and second as farce - according to\n\nKarl Marx - then Lord Armstrong of Ilminster is a fine oracle to consult as\n\nDavid Cameron prepares to announce a referendum on Britain's membership of the\n\nEU.\n\n\n\nAs principal private secretary to Harold Wilson, Armstrong had a ringside seat\n\nwhen the late Labour prime minister renegotiated the terms of Britain's\n\nmembership of the EEC, which were put to voters in a referendum in 1975.\n\n\n\nArmstrong, 85, believes Cameron will embark on a similar course when he pledges\n\nin the Netherlands tomorrow to renegotiate a repatriation of powers which would\n\nthen be put to voters in a referendum. \"I think it's very alike,\" he says.\n\n\n\nStudents of the 1970s have been dusting off history books to see whether there\n\nare parallels between Wilson and Cameron, who both saw a referendum as a way of\n\ndealing with party divisions over Europe.\n\n\n\nPeter Kellner, the founder of the YouGov polling organisation, wrote this week\n\nof an \"uncanny resemblance\" between today and 1975, when support for\n\npro-Europeans caught up and then overtook opponents once the issues started to\n\nbe debated.\n\n\n\nArmstrong declines to be drawn on whether Cameron, who says his ultimate goal is\n\nto remain in the EU on new terms, will prevail and win a yes vote.\n\n\n\nHe puts this down to a familiar uncertainty, this time over how the EU and the\n\neurozone will develop over the next five years. \"I don't feel at all sure of the\n\noutcome any more than I did then,\" he says. \"Europe has come so much further\n\nsince that time. I don't know how much David Cameron is thinking about Wilson.\"\n\nArmstrong, the quintessential polished Whitehall mandarin, saw Britain's\n\ntroubled relationship inside Downing Street from the moment the UK joined in\n\n1973 until Margaret Thatcher started to turn against the EU in the late 1980s.\n\nHe was principal private secretary to Ted Heath, a close friend, who took\n\nBritain into the EEC, and was cabinet secretary when Thatcher laid the ground\n\nfor today's single market in the mid-1980s.\n\n\n\nArmstrong was one of the few people to witness one of the key moments which has\n\nparallels with today. He was at Chequers when Wilson took himself into his study\n\nfor private reflection in December 1974 after the German chancellor Helmut\n\nSchmidt told the Labour party \"some home truths in words of one syllable\" over\n\nits plans to renegotiate its membership terms. \"For over two hours, Harold sat\n\nin the study after Schmidt had gone,\" Armstrong recalls. \"He was entirely on his\n\nown. He made one telephone call to (foreign secretary) Jim Callaghan and then he\n\ncalled me in and he told me what he was going to do. I was obviously, having\n\nworked with Ted Heath, committed to Europe. And I can remember a sense of relief\n\nwhen he told me.\"\n\n\n\nWilson decided to renegotiate more modest terms and to hold a referendum.\n\n\"Harold didn't get what he set out to get. But he got what he thought would be\n\ngood enough to say he'd done all right.\" Nearly 40 years on and Cameron knows\n\nthat his strategy lies in the hands of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who\n\nis well disposed to Britain. But, like Schmidt, who understood the need to help\n\nBritain but made clear there were limits, her patience is not finite.\n\n\n\nAs the man who will always be remembered for coining the phrase \"economical with\n\nthe truth\", Armstrong is discreet about Cameron. But he indicates that he does\n\nnot feel he is quite in the mould of some of the prime ministers he knew as he\n\ncites Sir John Major, who secured Britain's opt-out from the single currency.\n\n\n\n\"I think the stakes are very high and I think David Cameron is playing a very\n\ndifficult game. It's a game rather like Mr Wilson had. I think John Major was\n\nclever enough to get the outcome that he really wanted. I'm not sure if Cameron\n\nwill.\"\n\n\n\nIn his longest stint, Armstrong served as Thatcher's cabinet secretary from\n\n1979-87. Like Cameron and unlike Heath, Thatcher never felt an emotional\n\nattachment to the EU though she remained wholeheartedly committed to Britain's\n\nmembership, he says.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron risks making \"premature\" and \"opportunistic\" demands in Europe and\n\nweakening Britain's power in Washington and other major capitals, the most\n\nsenior diplomat to leave government in recent years warned yesterday.\n\n\n\nSir Nigel Sheinwald, Britain's ambassador to Washington until last year and\n\nbefore that the senior British diplomat in Brussels, said in a Guardian\n\ninterview that recent warnings by the US administration urging Britain against\n\nstaging a distracting referendum was \"a conscious decision by the Obama\n\nadministration to intervene in the UK debate\", reflecting a long-standing view\n\nthat it wanted its closest political ally closely involved in Europe.\n\n\n\nIn his first interview on the politically charged subject of Europe - and using\n\nunusually candid language for an ex-diplomat - Sheinwald said: \"If Britain is\n\nactive and influential in Washington that makes us more influential in Brussels,\n\nDelhi and elsewhere. Equally if we are influential in Europe, then we have a\n\nbigger impact in Washington and the other power capitals. These things are\n\nmutually reinforcing.\n\n\n\n\"I just cannot see any logical basis for thinking a move to the sidelines, or\n\nparticularly a move out of Europe, would be anything other than diminishing to\n\nthe UK's capacity, standing, influence, ability to get things done and capacity\n\nto build coalitions internationally.\"\n\n\n\nSheinwald also warned that in the eyes of the Americans the Cameron intervention\n\nrisked slowing the pace of European economic recovery. Nick Clegg spoke in\n\nsimilar terms yesterday, telling Cameron not to create prolonged uncertainty\n\nbecause of the damaging effect on jobs.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister is preparing to tell his Conservative cabinet colleagues\n\ntoday of the European negotiating strategy he plans to set out in a landmark\n\nspeech in the Netherlands on Friday.\n\n\n\nSheinwald, ambassador to Washington between 2007 and 2012, is the most senior\n\ndiplomatic figure to urge caution on Cameron. He was also the UK diplomatic lead\n\nin Brussels between 2000 and 2003, as well as chief foreign policy adviser to\n\nTony Blair between 2003 and 2007. He is now a member of the thinktank and\n\nadvocacy group Business for New Europe.\n\n\n\nSheinwald disclosed that US businesses were increasingly asking about Cameron's\n\nintentions and expressing alarm that Britain, as the main gateway to European\n\ninvestment, might be closed. He repeatedly urged Cameron to be cautious in his\n\nspeech. \"British business has been disappointed by the failure of the British\n\npolitical class to speak up on Europe for a long time, but they have realised\n\nthe debate has taken a dramatic turn.\"\n\n\n\nHe added: \"We have sold investment in the UK on the basis that the UK is the\n\nbest gateway into the single market. That is the way we have presented\n\nourselves. American firms and firms from the far east have based themselves in\n\nLondon for that reason. That has been such a success over the past decade or 15\n\nyears.\" Sheinwald cautioned Cameron against tabling demands for the repatriation\n\nof UK powers, saying it is too early to know what the rest of the EU might seek\n\nin negotiations after the European elections in 2014.\n\n\n\n\"To take the position some take here in the UK, which is our European partners\n\nare going to be asking for the moon, and therefore it won't be surprising if we\n\nput in a very large demand on the table - that seems to be at the very least\n\npremature. In any event other members of the EU would regard any really\n\nsignificant proposals by us to renegotiate as opportunistic, given the main\n\nareas they are going to be examining are ones they would say are necessary for\n\nthe euro to survive and prosper.\"\n\n\n\nAnything seen as an unravelling of the single market or the fragmentation of the\n\nEU would be \"a bridge too far\". He added: \"Investors are worried by the thought\n\nthat we are going to end up outside the EU by mistake, or without thinking\n\nthrough the economic consequences or end up with an inferior model like Norway\n\nor Switzerland.\" Philip Gordon, the US under-secretary for European affairs,\n\nlast week urged Cameron not to hold a referendum.\n\n\n\nSheinwald said the White House regards \"another dose of uncertainty on top of\n\nthe euro crisis as deeply unwelcome\". He added: \"The idea, if there were an\n\nidea, of going it alone being somehow appealing to our traditional partners or\n\nto our future partners in Asia or elsewhere in the world has been undermined\n\nvery significantly by the comments made by the Obama administration.\"\n\n\n\nBritain had succeeded in negotiations in Europe in the past 25 years, and there\n\nwould always be efforts to accommodate a partner. But he warned Cameron the\n\nreferendum promise \"would not be regarded as a knockout blow . . . I certainly\n\ndon't think it will mean everyone will say 'fine, they have got a lock on the\n\nnegotiations, we have to give them what they want'. There is too much at stake\n\non the rest of the continent.\"\n\n\n\n",

The backbench body calls for \"a new and different relationship\" with\n\nthe European Union.\n\n\n\nClarke, the most pro-European Tory member of the government who campaigned a\n\ndecade ago for Britain to join the euro, warns that the prime minister's\n\nstrategy could end in British withdrawal from the EU. Cameron will pledge to\n\nhold a referendum on a \"new settlement\" which he would negotiate, if elected\n\nwith a majority, when a major EU treaty revision takes place to underpin new\n\neurozone governance arrangements.\n\n\n\nClarke identified a hard core of Tory MPs who want to leave the EU. In an\n\ninterview with the Financial Times the minister without portfolio likened them\n\nto Tory supporters of capital punishment in the 1970s who demanded a referendum\n\non the issue because they could not command a parliamentary majority. \"If you\n\nrealise you're doomed in parliament you demand a referendum - that's what the\n\nhangers and floggers used to do,\" he said.\n\n\n\nClarke is to join forces with Lord Mandelson to launch a new pro-European group,\n\nthe Centre for British Influence through Europe. \"All referenda are a bit of a\n\ngamble,\" he said. \"I don't think we can take a yes vote for granted.\n\n\n\n\"I think one of the problems is . . . no one has really campaigned very\n\nvigorously for the case for British leadership in the EU for probably a decade\n\nor more.\"\n\n\n\nClarke warned Britain would damage its interests if it left the EU.\n\n\n\nHis warnings came as the Fresh Start group called for what it called four\n\n\"significant revisions\" to treaties governing the EU. The Daily Telegraph\n\nreported that the group will call for:\n\n\n\n* A complete repatriation of social and employment laws such as the working time\n\ndirective which imposes a 48-hour working week. Britain has an opt-out from that\n\naspect of the directive.\n\n\n\n* A opt-out from all criminal justice measures.\n\n\n\n* An \"emergency brake\" that would give Britain an effective veto over new\n\nfinancial services regulations.\n\n\n\n* An end to the monthly plenary sessions of the European parliament held in\n\nStrasbourg.\n\n\n\nIts manifesto says: \"If negotiation to repatriate these powers failed, we should\n\nconsider the unilateral disapplication of EU social and employment law in\n\nBritain through an act of parliament.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDowning Street has been laughing off a series of jibes from grandees ahead of\n\nDavid Cameron's speech on Europe on the grounds that few have had the ear of\n\nprime ministers and presidents in recent years.\n\n\n\nNo 10 may find it less easy to dismiss an intervention by a new recruit to the\n\ngrandees' club who, until last year, was at the heart of Britain's transatlantic\n\nrelationship for more than a decade.\n\n\n\nIf Tony Blair's famous Atlantic bridge, in which Britain serves as a link\n\nbetween Europe and the US, ever took human form then Sir Nigel Sheinwald carried\n\nquite a burden as British ambassador to the EU and Washington. Bearing the\n\nscars, or colours, from 10 years on the transatlantic bridge Sheinwald delivers\n\none key message before the prime minister's long-awaited speech on Europe on\n\nFriday. Britain will diminish its influence in the US if it raises questions\n\nabout its commitment to the EU, let alone leaves it altogether.\n\n\n\n\"A Britain on the sidelines of Europe, even more out of Europe, would not be in\n\nthe American interest and would not be in the interest of other major European\n\npartners,\" Sheinwald told the Guardian from New York yesterday.\n\n\n\nThe remarks are a significant contribution to the debate because they echo,\n\nalmost word for word, a warning by the Obama administration of the dangers in\n\nCameron's strategy to be outlined in the Netherlands on Friday. Philip Gordon,\n\nthe US assistant secretary of state, questioned the prime minister's plans for a\n\nreferendum and said that \"a strong British voice\" in the EU was \"in the American\n\ninterest\".\n\n\n\nSheinwald said he was not in the slightest bit surprised by the US intervention\n\nwhich was the result of a \"conscious decision\". Eurosceptics, who dismissed the\n\nremarks by Gordon, will now have to contend with the views of the man who eased\n\nthe path for Cameron's successful trip to Washington last March. This took place\n\ntwo months after Sheinwald retired as ambassador to Washington after a five-year\n\nstint that followed seven years at the heart of EU policy, as Britain's\n\n\"permanent representative\" in Brussels between 2000-03 and as Tony Blair's main\n\nEuropean adviser between 2003-07.\n\n\n\nOne of the most arduous tasks of the \"perm reps\" is to attend the weekly\n\nmeetings of all 27 ambassadors to the EU, which gave Sheinwald an insight into\n\nthe possibilities - and limitations - of EU negotiations. The prime minister is\n\nexpected to pledge to hold a referendum on a \"new settlement\" in Britain's place\n\nin the EU if he wins the next general election. Cameron would use Britain's veto\n\nin a major revision of the Lisbon treaty, designed to underpin new governance\n\narrangements for the eurozone after the 2014 European parliamentary elections,\n\nto demand a repatriation of powers.\n\n\n\nSheinwald says Cameron should not assume there will be a big-bang treaty\n\nrenegotiation that will enable him to table extensive demands for the\n\nrepatriation of British powers. \"I still don't believe that that process is\n\ngoing to be anything other than a slow, difficult and gradual one given the\n\ncomplexity of the issues.\"\n\n\n\nIn his lengthy Foreign Office career Sheinwald, 59, witnessed the painful birth\n\nof the greatest example of European integration which is at the heart of the\n\ncontinent's current pain. He takes issue with one of the prime minister's\n\ncentral calculations about the euro which is informing No 10's entire European\n\nstrategy - that the \"remorseless logic\" of monetary union will lead to a fiscal\n\nunion which Britain should encourage but not join. It is in those negotiations\n\nthat the prime minister hopes to repatriate powers.\n\n\n\n\"I am not disagreeing that there is a remorseless logic about further\n\nintegration,\" Sheinwald says. \"What I am arguing about is the matter of degree -\n\nthe sense that it is in our interests to make them as separate as possible from\n\nus is where I would part company from the viewpoint.\"\n\n\n\nSheinwald laughs as he sympathises with Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, one of the few\n\npeople also to have served as ambassador to Washington and the EU, who warned in\n\nthe Guardian last month that the prime minister is in danger of leaving the EU\n\nby accident.\n\n\n\n\"Whether that would be the be all and end all - or whether as in Ireland or in\n\nDenmark you would have a re-run of the referendum - who knows? But it would\n\ncreate a major crisis in the British relationship with the rest of EU.\"\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\n'Britain on the sidelines, would not be in the US interests and not in the\n\ninterests of major EU partners '\n\n\n\nNigel Sheinwald\n\n\n\n",

They helped send\n\nthe euro up to 83.28p against the pound, its highest level since April 2012.\n\nTraders blamed the pound's weakness on fears that Britain was heading into a\n\ntriple-dip recession and jitters over a referendum over Britain's EU membership.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nBritain is in danger of putting at risk the fight against terrorism and\n\norganised crime if the Conservatives win a battle within the coalition to end\n\nBritish involvement in a series of European Union justice measures.\n\n\n\nAs Downing Street rushed forward David Cameron's long-awaited speech on Europe,\n\nwhich he will now deliver in the Netherlands on Friday, key crime fighting\n\nagencies warned of a risk to public safety if Britain distances itself from the\n\nEU.\n\n\n\nThe prime minister will move to heal divisions within the Conservative party\n\nover Europe, which played a part in the overthrow of Margaret Thatcher in 1990,\n\nwhen he sets out plans to hold a referendum on British membership of the EU.\n\n\n\nDowning Street was forced to bring forward the speech by four days after France\n\nand Germany reacted angrily to reports that it would take place on 22 January.\n\nAngela Merkel is understood to have told Cameron of unease that the speech would\n\ntake place as Paris and Berlin celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Elysee\n\ntreaty which set the seal on their postwar reconciliation.\n\n\n\nIn his speech, delayed by months amid Tory divisions and concerns on the\n\ncontinent that Britain is moving to the exit, the prime minister is expected to\n\nsay he will seek consent in his party's manifesto for the next election to\n\nrenegotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership. He will brief Tory cabinet\n\nministers at a special political cabinet on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHe would use an expected revision of the Lisbon treaty within the next five\n\nyears, designed to underpin new governance arrangements for the eurozone, to\n\nrepatriate powers to Britain. The changes, which could involve radically\n\nrewriting the working time directive and safeguarding British interests in the\n\nsingle market as the eurozone integrates, would then be put to the British\n\npeople in a referendum if the Tories win the next election.\n\n\n\nCoalition divisions will be highlighted when Nick Clegg, who has described\n\nCameron's plans to repatriate powers as a \"false promise wrapped in a union\n\njack\", embarks on a series of early morning broadcast interviews.\n\n\n\nThe challenge to the prime minister of reframing Britain's position within the\n\nEU has been highlighted by a series of warnings of the dangers of abandoning EU\n\njustice measures. The prime minister has agreed with Clegg that Britain will\n\nexercise its right under the Lisbon treaty to opt out of around 130 criminal\n\njustice measures by next year.\n\n\n\nBut the two leaders are involved in an intense debate as the prime minister\n\nargues that Britain should then opt back in to a minimal number of measures.\n\nClegg has said that the police and MI5, which want to retain measures such as\n\nthe European arrest warrant (EAW), should be given the final say.\n\n\n\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers has issued a powerful warning of the\n\ndangers of opting out of the EAW and other measures. In a submission to a House\n\nof Lords EU subcommittee, it said: \"Most of the stakeholders consulted believe\n\nthat opting out of this and relying on alternative arrangements would result in\n\nfewer extraditions, longer delays, higher costs, more offenders evading justice\n\nand increased risk to public safety.\"\n\n\n\nDavid Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the\n\nLords committee: \"My only concerns as independent reviewer are that the UK\n\nshould not put at risk its ability to rely on such pre-Lisbon measures as are of\n\ngenuine assistance in the fight against terrorism and . . . that it should not\n\ndiminish the beneficial influence over other countries' approach to\n\ncounter-terrorism that it has earned through the EU over the years.\"\n\n\n\nThe Irish government has raised concerns about the impact of tackling\n\ncross-border terrorism. In his submission to the committee, the Northern Ireland\n\njustice minister, David Ford, said that Ireland's justice and equality minister,\n\nAlan Shatter, has raised concerns. Ford said: \"I remain concerned that the\n\npotentially very significant effects on Northern Ireland may not be fully\n\nrecognised in Whitehall. It is vital that the decisions made are those in the\n\nbest interests of all parts of the UK.\"\n\n\n\nDowning Street has said it will do nothing to jeopardise public safety. Sources\n\nsaid No 10 was relaxed about the delay in the prime minister's speech despite\n\nanger in the Tory party that it has allowed critics, from supporters of the\n\nGerman chancellor, Angela Merkel, to the former deputy prime minister Michael\n\nHeseltine to attack the prime minister.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron is heading for a battle on all fronts over Europe as ministers\n\nprepare to reject key ideas drawn up by the largest group of Eurosceptic Tory\n\nMPs and pro-Europeans dig in for a major confrontation with Downing Street.\n\n\n\nAs Eric Pickles became the second cabinet minister to warn that Britain may have\n\nto leave the EU, the government is understood to have decided that it will\n\nreject \"nuclear\" proposals that are to be outlined by the Fresh Start group of\n\nMPs this week.\n\n\n\nThe jostling within the Conservative party continued as it emerged that Kenneth\n\nClarke is preparing to join forces with Lord Mandelson to make the case for\n\nwhole-hearted British membership of the EU.\n\n\n\nEd Miliband warned that the prime minister was in danger of \"sleepwalking\"\n\nBritain towards the EU exit door. \"I think it is incredibly dangerous what David\n\nCameron is doing,\" the Labour leader told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 of the\n\nprime minister's plans to hold a referendum on renegotiated terms of British\n\nmembership. \"He is essentially sleepwalking us towards the exit door from the\n\nEU.\"\n\n\n\nCameron is planning to announce in a long-awaited speech on Europe, due to be\n\ndelivered in the Netherlands later this month, that the Tory manifesto for the\n\nnext election will include a pledge to use a treaty revision to repatriate\n\npowers to Britain. The new terms of British membership would then be put to the\n\nBritish people in a referendum after the next general election.\n\n\n\nPickles, the communities secretary, last night echoed a warning by the\n\nchancellor, George Osborne, that Britain should be prepared to leave the EU\n\nunless its demands are met. He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio Five Live:\n\n\"If it's in our firm national interest that we should remain in the EU - and I\n\nsincerely hope that is the case - then we should stay. But we shouldn't stay at\n\nany price.\"\n\n\n\nThe prime minister is expected to show that there are limits to his demands when\n\nhe rejects what have been described as \"nuclear\" options to be outlined on\n\nWednesday by the Fresh Start group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs.\n\n\n\nThese were first outlined to the Guardian last month by Andrea Leadsom, a\n\nleading figure in the group, who called for an effective veto for Britain over\n\nfinancial services regulations. At the moment these are decided by qualified\n\nmajority voting (QMV). The veto would be introduced by formalising the so called\n\n\"Luxembourg compromise\". This allows a member state to call a halt to QMV if a\n\nvital national interest is at stake.\n\n\n\nShe also called for Britain to join forces with like-minded EU member states to\n\nbring an end to the working-time directive, which says that no one should be\n\nmade to work more than 48 hours a week. Britain has an opt-out. The directive\n\ncould be challenged by the \"yellow card\" system in the Lisbon treaty, which\n\nallows a majority of member states to block a proposal.\n\n\n\nIt is understood the government will give a favourable response to the group's\n\nproposals to repatriate more than 130 powers from the EU. It is expected that\n\nthe report will be hailed for proposing \"interesting and creative\" ideas.\n\n\n\nBut the two \"nuclear\" options are expected eventually to be rejected. One\n\nWhitehall source said of the veto proposal: \"There are some interesting points\n\nabout mechanisms and, yes, there are emergency brakes in the Lisbon treaty. But\n\ndo we want France to have the same powers? Do we want a President Melenchon (the\n\nleft-wing candidate who polled strongly in the first round last year) to say he\n\ndoes not like the idea of Asian financial houses setting up in London?\n\n\n\n\"You have to think through the consequences of these proposals. How do you\n\ndefine financial services? They are not defined in the treaties. It is all\n\nsingle market stuff which is decided by QMV.\"\n\n\n\nGeorge Eustice, the prime minister's former press secretary who is one of the\n\nfounders of the Fresh Start group, said: \"We have put forward a wishlist which\n\nwe think is a helpful contribution to the debate. The government has a difficult\n\njob in deciding what it can achieve in the negotiations. Putting constructive\n\nideas on the table is preferable to the alternative of everyone obsessing about\n\na referendum on leaving the EU.\"\n\n\n\nClarke and Mandelson are to join up in a new group called Centre for British\n\nInfluence through Europe, which, the organisation hopes, will turn back the\n\nrising tide of Euroscepticism.\n\n\n\nCaptions:\n\n\n\nEric Pickles is the second Conservative minister to warn that Britain may have\n\nto leave the European Union\n\n\n\n",
