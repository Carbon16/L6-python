        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron will today demand strict controls on countries trying to join the\n\nEuropean Union in an attempt to head off a future influx of migrants from\n\nEastern Europe.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister will use a gathering of European leaders to warn that the\n\nmovement of workers from countries such as Serbia and Albania must be\n\nsignificantly restricted before they are handed EU membership.\n\n\n\nIt marks the latest attempt by Mr Cameron to lobby for a revision of the EU's\n\nfree movement rules, which allow workers from poor states to migrate at will\n\nacross Europe. He hopes to make an overhaul of the rules the cornerstone of a\n\n\"new relationship\" with Europe, which he intends to put to an in/out referendum\n\nin 2017.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister will effectively have to hijack today's talks to raise his\n\nconcerns. European Commission sources said that the possible accession of Serbia\n\nand Albania was not part of the agenda agreed before the summit.\n\n\n\n\"The Prime Minister will say that he is a firm supporter of enlargement, but we\n\nhave to realise that when the EU was established and the treaties were signed,\n\npeople did not expect it to bring the sort of mass-migratory movements it has,\"\n\na diplomatic source said. \"When we look at future countries joining, we should\n\nthink about how we address some of those issues.\" Serbia's accession to the EU\n\nhas taken a significant step forward after European foreign ministers agreed to\n\nstart membership talks next month. Albania's prospects of membership are much\n\nfarther off. It is one of the poorest European nations, with unemployment\n\nrunning at about 13 per cent of the workforce. There is growing support, though,\n\nfor handing it \"candidate status\" - a necessary precursor to becoming an EU\n\nstate. A decision is expected next June.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron remains under huge pressure regarding the free movement of EU workers\n\nto Britain, with restrictions on the migration of Bulgarian and Romanian workers\n\ncoming to an end at the start of January. His backbenchers yesterday clashed\n\nover the impact of a possible influx in a debate in Westminster Hall.\n\n\n\nTobias Ellwood, an aide to the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, angered right-wing\n\ncolleagues with the barbed claim that the debate had become polarised between\n\n\"little England\" and the \"multicultural, opendoor approach\". He said that it was\n\nimportant to focus on \"facts and figures\" rather than \"some of the quite barmy\n\nassumptions ... that have been repeated and then gain credence\".\n\n\n\nHis remarks provoked a furious reaction from Mark Reckless, who said that if Mr\n\nEllwood put himself in the \"open-door\" category it would be \"more a sign of his\n\nown narcissism than anything else\".\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a paradox that, as politics becomes ever more presidential, the party\n\nleaders are losing power. David Cameron and Ed Miliband take selfies with global\n\nstatesmen and celebrities, but they are at the mercy of events at home and\n\nabroad.\n\n\n\nAlthough they are the political frontmen who must prepare for the leaders'\n\ntelevision debates during a general election campaign, their authority is\n\nincreasingly challenged from both within and outside their own parties.\n\n\n\nThis is partly to do with the existence of the coalition, a Government in which\n\ninfluence is, by definition, diffused. Indeed Nick Clegg is trying to make a\n\nvirtue of being the kingmaker who will never inherit the throne.\n\n\n\nThat, however, is not the only explanation. At Westminster, the balance has\n\nshifted between the Executive and Parliament. MPs, who have given up all hope of\n\npromotion, are standing up more and more to the party machines. The Syria defeat\n\nthis summer was a shock to No 10, but it should not have been. A growing number\n\nof concessions - from a referendum on Europe to the introduction of plain\n\ncigarette packaging - have been forced on the Government by the threat of\n\nrebellion. Labour MPs are not much more docile than Conservatives. Mr Miliband\n\nfaces dissent over welfare reform, public sector pay and the trade unions.\n\n\n\nHouse of Commons select committees - their members now elected by fellow MPs -\n\nhave been emboldened to challenge the system. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who\n\nchairs the Public Accounts Committee, is almost as influential as the Labour\n\nleader and has a greater grip on departmental detail than many ministers. The\n\ncommittee's reports regularly expose Whitehall waste and incompetence and with\n\nher forensic scrutiny of everything from Universal Credit to BBC pay-offs, Mrs\n\nHodge has risen above party politics, defending the taxpayer rather than a\n\npolitical tribe.\n\n\n\nSmart MPs, burnt by the expenses scandal, know that they can no longer play by\n\nthe old rules. The most successful are turning themselves into champions of the\n\npeople over the political elite. They understand that what is seen as an\n\nanti-politics mood is in fact hostility to the Establishment - and can be\n\nharnessed by politicians such as Boris Johnson or Nigel Farage who present\n\nthemselves as outsiders. Success is being redefined so that it no longer depends\n\non holding ministerial office.\n\n\n\nTwitter has become a tool for campaigning backbenchers to bring about change.\n\nStella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, persuaded first her own party and\n\nthen the Government to clamp down on pay-day loans by running an energetic\n\nsocial media campaign in her own constituency.\n\n\n\nRobert Halfon, the Conservative backbencher, is described as \"the most expensive\n\nMP in Parliament\" by the Prime Minister because of his almost single-handed\n\nsuccess in forcing the Chancellor to scrap rises in fuel duty. The election of\n\nsome MPs through open primaries has increased the mood of independence - they\n\nowe more to the voters who chose them than they do to their party leaders. The\n\nold hierarchies are breaking down.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister should be the most powerful politician in the land, but he\n\nseems oddly hamstrung. Today the independent Airports Commission will publish an\n\ninterim report - but the Government is still unable to make a decision on\n\nwhether or not to build a third runway at Heathrow.\n\n\n\nMr Clegg has described Tory plans to cap the number of EU migrants at 75,000 a\n\nyear as \"illegal and unworkable\". European and human rights legislation minimise\n\nthe room for manoeuvre. Business is another power to be reckoned with - the\n\nenergy companies were heavily involved in discussions about the Autumn\n\nStatement.\n\n\n\nThe Tory leader describes a \"little black book\" full of policies that have been\n\nblocked by the Lib Dems, but it is still not entirely clear how he ended up with\n\na massive reorganisation of the NHS (designed by a Conservative Health\n\nSecretary) that he neither planned nor particularly wanted. It is telling that\n\nhis most interesting interventions have been on things over which he has no\n\ncontrol - internet pornography and segregated seating at universities.\n\n\n\nAlthough he has taken a strong moral stand, he is dependent on others to act. At\n\nthe same time, Mr Cameron has subcontracted his own political identity to\n\nothers. The man who caught the public's attention as a Conservative moderniser\n\nhas given into pressure from the right to revert to more traditional themes,\n\nconfusing the message he sends out to voters and betraying a curious loss of\n\nconfidence.\n\n\n\nThere is a strange mixture in the Labour leader too. Mr Miliband veers from\n\nmoments of courage and radicalism - with grand statements promising to remake\n\ncapitalism - to an intense political caution learnt at Gordon Brown's knee.\n\nAlthough he has captured the public imagination by promising an energy price\n\nfreeze, a bank bonus tax and a housebuilding revolution, he agonises over every\n\ndecision. One Labour MP says that he is only really brave when dismantling Tony\n\nBlair's legacy - \"it's not courage, it's exorcism,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThere are signs that the Labour leader is backing away from a showdown with the\n\nunions. After the vote-rigging scandal in Falkirk, he expressed his fury and\n\npromised a transformation in the link between the party and the unions, but now\n\nUnite, Labour's biggest financial backer, has made clear that it will not allow\n\nits \"collective voice\" to be lost in the reforms. Mr Miliband should use this as\n\na chance to prove he can take on the \"vested interests\" of the Left as well as\n\nthe right, but he is said to be wavering on the scale and urgency of any change.\n\nIt is another example of power seeping away from the man at the top.\n\n\n\nAll eyes will be on the political leaders between now and 2015, but it is harder\n\nthan ever for any of them to declare, as Mr Cameron did in Afghanistan\n\nyesterday: \"Mission Accomplished.\"\n\n\n\nSmart MPs champion the people over the political elite\n\n\n\n"

If we don't get to\n\ngrips with these issues, pro-Europeans surrender the debate to the UKIPs of this\n\nworld,\" he added.\n\n\n\nHowever, sources admitted that Mr Cameron's key measure, the threemonth delay\n\nbefore EU migrants can claim out-of-work benefits, will require emergency\n\nlegislation and is unlikely to be in place by January 1, the date the\n\ntransitional controls on workers from Bulgaria and Romania are lifted.\n\n\n\nMost of the rest of the package can be delivered without new laws, government\n\nsources added, and so will be in place by the deadline. They concede, however,\n\nthat EU migrants who do find employment will be entitled to housing benefit.\n\nCritics will also point out that officials will have to prove that foreign\n\nclaimants do not have a realistic prospect of employment before removing their\n\nout-of-work benefits after six months.\n\n\n\nThe proposals, forecast by The Times last weekend, go further than many had\n\nexpected and reflect the depth of concern in No 10 at the danger of the issue\n\nbefore the European Parliament elections in May, where the Conservatives face a\n\nrout at the hands of UKIP.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron and the Deputy Prime Minister sought to lay the blame for the issue\n\nat Labour's door. Mr Cameron said that the last Government made a monumental\n\nmistake in allowing untrammelled access to Britain's labour markets to the first\n\nwave of new EU nations in 2004 and had compounded the mistake three years later\n\nwhen Romania and Bulgaria joined.\n\n\n\n\"That was the moment to address difficult questions about when to allow new\n\nentrants full access to each others' labour markets, but the Labour Government\n\nducked these questions. That is why this Government extended transitional\n\ncontrols on Bulgaria and Romania from five to the maximum seven years,\" he\n\nadded.\n\n\n\nMinisters have avoided predicting how many migrants will arrive after the ban is\n\nrelaxed, but MigrationWatch UK has estimated that about 50,000 will travel to\n\nthe UK.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Government admits that it can do nothing about the current\n\naccession countries, Mr Cameron said he would fight for new checks for future EU\n\nmembers.\n\n\n\nOne idea would be to set new member countries a \"share of average EU GDP per\n\nhead before full free movement was allowed. Individual member states could be\n\nfreed to impose a cap if their inflow from the EU reached a certain number in a\n\nsingle year\".\n\n\n\nThe Government's nervousness about immigration has increased after an unwelcome\n\nrise in the number of net migrants three months ago. Immigration figures due\n\ntomorrow will show whether that trend has continued.Net migration rose to\n\n176,000 in the year to the end of December 2012 compared with 153,000 in the\n\ntwelve months to September 2012.\n\n\n\n"

But he said Paul had\n\na private jet flight to catch, so he made us decide in just five minutes whether\n\nto accept,\" she said.\n\n\n\nMr Farage \"pushed it through, even though it meant changing the party's\n\nconstitution\", she added. \"The UKIP conference later that year passed a motion\n\ncriticising the decision and confirming the [original] constitution.\" Mr Farage\n\nalso came under attack from Ms Sinclaire for being a \"misogynist\" with a \"bad\n\ntemper\". She recounted an episode at a UKIP meeting in which she claimed that he\n\nscreamed at her in front of colleagues and thumped his fists on the table,\n\nangered by her questions concerning the party's finances.\n\n\n\nShe said: \"He has a Stalinist approach ... He's purged the party of all talent\n\n... he's threatened by intelligent people.\"\n\n\n\nMs Sinclaire, who reveals in her new book that she is transsexual, said that Mr\n\nFarage tried to hound her out of the party, because, she claims, he disapproves\n\nof \"alternative lifestyles\". UKIP and Eurosceptic Conservative MEPs also faced\n\ncriticism from Ms Sinclaire.\n\n\n\nShe denounced many for failing to turn up in Brussels for votes on motions that\n\nthreatened to diminish British sovereignty and said that most UKIP MEPs were \"in\n\nit for the money\".\n\n\n\nAfter working with the party for about two decades, Ms Sinclaire resigned from\n\nUKIP in 2009 after it joined Europe of Freedom and Democracy, an international\n\nalliance of Eurosceptic parties, which she claimed was anti-Semitic and\n\nhomophobic.\n\n\n\nShe launched her own Eurosceptic single-issue party, We Demand a Referendum, for\n\nwhich she remains an MEP. She claims to work 70-hour weeks and pointed out that\n\nshe has donated Â£120,000 of her own money to her party since 2009. Last year,\n\nhowever, she was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud the European\n\nParliament, allegations she denies, and remains on bail. A spokesman for Mr\n\nFarage and UKIP said: \"UKIP has never changed its policy from day one on wanting\n\nto leave the EU. Paul Sykes has always been of the view that we cannot criticise\n\nthe lack of democracy within the EU without offering a choice ourselves.\n\n\n\n\"Mr Farage couldn't care two hoots what people do in their personal lives.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that Mr Farage had become angry in the past with Ms Sinclaire because\n\n\"she refused to co-operate with her fellow MEPs and staff\". Never Give Up by\n\nNikki Sinclaire is published today (Â£18.95). See www.JuniusPress.org or call\n\n0121 333 7176.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance is on the brink of full-scale insurrection and bankruptcy after decades\n\nof selling out to immigrants and opening its borders to foreign trade, the\n\nleader of the French National Front has told The Times, warning that the country\n\nwould be \"put to the fire and the sword\".\n\n\n\nMarine Le Pen, 45, said that it would only take a spark to tip Europe's second\n\neconomic power into virtual civil war - and that the trigger could be the\n\nviolent anti-tax demonstrations taking place in Britanny over the past month.\n\n\n\nThe National Front is now polling as the most popular political group in France\n\nfor the first time in its history.\n\n\n\nMs Le Pen criticises the chronic weakness of FranÃ§ois Hollande, who is the most\n\nunpopular French President since Charles de Gaulle after only 18 months in\n\noffice.\n\n\n\nShe said: \"FranÃ§ois Hollande is just a provincial sub-prefect who is well suited\n\nto his place in the European Union - the boss of a technocrat government who\n\ntakes his marching orders from Brussels.\n\n\n\n\"The trouble is that France is going to be put to fire and the sword. I think we\n\nare in a time of revolt.\n\n\n\nThe French have the feeling that FranÃ§ois Hollande has no idea of where he is\n\nleading them. If Brittany rises up, watch out, it could spread like wildfire.\"\n\nThis month, Ms Le Pen, who has voiced approval for David Cameron, co-founded a\n\nContinent-wide anti-EU movement, teaming up with Geert Wilders, the far-Right\n\nDutch politician.\n\n\n\nShe says that France and the rest of the European Union was driven to bankruptcy\n\nby the creed of free trade, the euro, open frontiers and the ethnic melting pot.\n\n\"Now that the danger no longer stems from communism, the threat is coming from\n\nle 'mondialisme',\" she says. \"That means the sort of theory of the all-powerful\n\nmarket which will regulate itself. It's a form of totalitarianism, a\n\ntotalitarianism of all-out commerce.\n\n\n\nImmigration is the child of this globalism.\" This has nothing to do with racism,\n\nshe insists.\n\n\n\nPredictions of revolt have long been part of the National Front's armoury, but a\n\nseries of protests, strikes and racist incidents have lately reflected an ugly\n\nmood in France. The prefects - state officials who administer all the\n\ndÃ©partements - have just reported to Paris: \"Throughout the land ... society is\n\nin the grip of tension, exasperation and anger.\" Ms Le Pen's attack on Europe\n\nand free trade underlines her shift towards the broad \"sovereignist\" themes that\n\nhave enabled her to strike a distance from the xenophobic discourse that ensured\n\nthat Jean-Marie Le Pen, her father and founder of the National Front, remained a\n\npariah. Enjoying increasing support from disaffected Socialist voters, she\n\ninsists that the party is neither left-wing nor right-wing but \"patriotic\".\n\n\n\nThis softened line has enabled her to team up with Mr Wilders, leader of the\n\nDutch Freedom Party, at the head of an alliance of anti-EU parties in Austria,\n\nBelgium, Italy and Scandinavia. Mr Wilders, who also leads his country's most\n\npopular party, said that their aim was \"to roll back the Brussels monster\" after\n\nscoring a triumph next May in elections to the European Parliament. Ms Le Pen\n\ntalks warmly of Nigel Farage and UKIP and says that she is disappointed that\n\ndespite long talks with him, he has declined to join the new European alliance.\n\n\n\n\"He knows the National Front well,\" she says. \"His UKIP is a young movement\n\nwhich is suffering the same strong demonisation that is applied to everyone that\n\nopposes the EU. He is not tough enough yet to resist the demonisation ... It's a\n\npity that UKIP is staying isolated when all the patriotic forces will be allied\n\ntogether.\"\n\n\n\nMr Farage said last week that the Front was still too tainted by \"anti-Semitism\n\nand general prejudice\" for UKIP to ally with them.\n\n\n\nMs Le Pen notes that her policy on Europe is similar to London's because she\n\nwants to renegotiate membership terms and put the results to an in-out\n\nreferendum \"exactly like David Cameron\". She wants France to leave the euro and\n\njoin Britain outside the Schengen zone of open internal EU frontiers. She said\n\nthat Mr Cameron had been acting in response to the \"courageous\" pressure applied\n\nby UKIP. \"I feel close to Cameron in what he says, but is he going to follow\n\nthrough? I'm still a little dubious.\"\n\n\n\nThe surge of support for Ms Le Pen's party echoes that of UKIP in Britain as\n\neach ride a tide of hostility to \"Brussels\". The source of French anti-EU\n\nfeeling is in large part the opposite of Britain's. Ms Le Pen and much of France\n\nconsider that Britain and its northern allies have hijacked the Union over the\n\npast two decades to force their free-market ideas on the Continent.\n\n\n\nMs Le Pen's party is polling ahead of the field before the French council\n\nelections in March and European elections in May.\n\n\n\n"

I interviewed Ed back in 2010 during the\n\nLabour leadership campaign and asked what kind of music he liked. There was a\n\nlong pause. \"A-ha,\" he said. \"Are you kidding?\" I asked, incredulous.

The star rambler, if you can be such a\n\nthing, was Labour's Mike Gapes who, over the course of what seemed liked hours\n\n(because it was), explored such burning questions as the meaning of the word\n\n\"be\" and ramifications for Welsh speakers.\n\n\n\nMr Gapes insisted the date of the vote must not clash with any religious\n\nfestivities. \"The Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Jews, Zoroastrians, Muslims and\n\nChristians will all need to be consulted,\" said Mr Gapes. At which point the\n\nLabour backbencher Kevan Jones erupted: \"The Zoroastrians!\" But Mr Gapes would\n\nnot be moved. So take it from me, when it comes to a vote, the Zoroastrians will\n\nhave had their say.\n\n\n\nMICKEY FAB'S STICK-ON 'TACHE IS A BIT OF BARE-FACED CHEEK\n\n\n\nThere are some magnificent moustaches among MPs (sadly, only male ones but I\n\nlive in hope) grown in support of the Movember movement to highlight awareness\n\nof prostate cancer. But the Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant, or Micky Fab\n\nas he is known, wasn't sure he could grow more than a bit of blonde fuzz. So\n\ninstead of the full Monty, he's going for what he calls the full fake Monty\n\nwhich he has ordered from Amazon for Â£2.50.\n\n\n\n\"It's supposed to be a wing commander's moustache,\" he tells me. \"NOT 'In the\n\nNaveeee ...\"\n\n\n\nThe Pringles-man-on-the-can 'tache is black, which should go splendidly with\n\nMicky's strawcoloured hair substance that he insists is not a wig.

Labour came seventh and the Conservative team\n\ndisgraced itself by tying for last and even misspelling Ronald Reagan's name.\n\nAmazingly, the Tories did not know the answer to this one: \"What was the name of\n\nthe street in Brixton where John Major pointed out the Enterprise Pub in the\n\nfamous 1992 Party Political broadcast?\"* If they can't win that, whither the\n\ngeneral election?\n\n\n\n*Coldharbour Lane\n\n\n\n"

It was the divisions on the Greek-Cypriot side\n\nthat scuppered an agreement in 2004, just after Clerides had stepped down as\n\nPresident. The Turkish-Cypriots endorsed the plan by a large margin in a\n\nreferendum. In a parallel referendum, however, the Greek-Cypriots voted it down,\n\nthanks to the replacement of Clerides by the rejectionist President Papadopoulos\n\nbut more importantly to the betrayal by the large Communist Party (AKEL) of its\n\nlongstanding support for the type of arrangements the plan embodied.\n\n\n\nIn addition, your slighting reference to the President's approach to foreign\n\npolicy underestimates the skills and tenacity of Clerides and his team in\n\nplacing his stake in the ground and making larger powers - the UN and the EU -\n\nwalk round it. In the case of the EU, the Europeans made a significant error in\n\noffering prematurely an unconditional promise of membership to Cyprus. This was\n\nthe formula agreed by the European Council at Helsinki in 1999: \"The European\n\nCouncil underlines that a political settlement will facilitate the accession of\n\nCyprus to the European Union. If no settlement has been reached by the\n\ncompletion of the accession negotiations, the Council's decision on accession\n\nwill be made without the above being a precondition. In this the Council will\n\ntake account of all relevant factors.\"\n\n\n\nThe Greek-Cypriots rejoiced over the middle sentence but noted - and attacked -\n\nthe last (\"the Helsinki tail\"). They need not have fretted: they predictably got\n\ntheir membership anyway. So the opportunity to maximise benign European leverage\n\nover Cyprus, and to avoid importing the inter-communal problem into the EU, was\n\nlost.\n\n\n\n@If you would like to add a personal view or recollection to a published\n\nobituary, you can send your contribution by post to Times Obituaries, 3 Thomas\n\nMore Square, London E98 1TT, or by e-mail to tributes@thetimes.co.uk\n\n\n\n"

Tightening\n\nborder controls tops the wishlist for renegotiation before a referendum on\n\nBritain's membership by a huge margin, according to YouGov polling for The\n\nTimes. It leads the next two highest ranked priorities - human rights reform and\n\nexpanding non-EU trade - by a margin of 30 per cent.\n\n\n\nMinisters are braced for a fierce public backlash when Britain opens its borders\n\nto jobseekers from Bulgaria and Romania on January 1. They are unwilling to put\n\na figure on the number expected to head to the UK seeking work, but Mark Harper,\n\nthe Immigration Minister, said it would not be a repeat of 2004 when within two\n\nyears almost 600,000 East Europeans came to work.\n\n\n\nMigrationWatch UK has estimated that about 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians a\n\nyear will come to Britain when curbs on them entering the jobs market are\n\nlifted.\n\n\n\nThe threat of a rout by UKIP in elections to the Europe Parliament next May is\n\nheaping pressure on the Conservatives to show that voters' worries are being\n\naddressed.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron has avoided giving details of the specific powers he will try to win\n\nback before the referendum on Britain's membership, promised by 2017, saying\n\nonly that it would include a clampdown on \"welfare tourism\".\n\n\n\nHowever, the Prime Minister is to start fleshing out that commitment next week\n\nwith measures to limit benefit entitlements of EU citizens, according to senior\n\ngovernment figures. The Government is engaged in a stand-off with the European\n\nCommission over moves to limit migrants' access to child benefit, child tax\n\ncredit and some forms of job-seekers' allowance for the first 12 months after\n\narrival.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron, however, is expected to argue that the EU's freedom of trade\n\ndirective should be loosened to allow the further extension of time limits as\n\nwell as new contributions eligibility tests on benefits. Migrants must also be\n\nactively looking for work and have a realistic prospect of getting a job under\n\nplanned restrictions to jobseeker's allowance.\n\n\n\nThat is unlikely to satisfy many, however, since most voters want Britain to\n\npull out of the directive altogether. Some 52 per cent said they would be\n\nwilling to sacrifice their own ability to live and work in other EU states as\n\nthe price for closing Britain's borders.\n\n\n\nToday's polling shows ministers should focus on low skilled migrants and those\n\nlooking for low-paid work if they want to meet voters' concerns. Attitudes to\n\nstudents, highly skilled workers and even asylum seekers are significantly less\n\nhostile, suggesting the public takes a nuanced view of EU immigration. Worries\n\nabout access to public services outstrip pressure on housing, jobs or crime\n\nlevels among those asked about its negative effects.\n\n\n\nBenefit entitlement across Europe is notoriously complex and has gradually\n\nexpanded as a result of court judgments. Think-tanks such as Open Europe,\n\nhowever, have suggested a range of changes to welfare entitlement that wouldn't\n\nrequire treaty change. These include changing the rules on child benefit to\n\nrequire children to be living in the host country to be eligible.\n\n\n\nMinisters are awaiting next week's immigration figures to see if they have\n\nreversed an upward trend in the numbers. Figures published three months ago\n\nshowed that the overall fall in net migration - the difference between those\n\narriving and those leaving - had halted. Net migration rose to 176,000 in the\n\nyear to the end of December 2012 compared with 153,000 in the twelve months to\n\nSeptember 2012. The Office for National Statistics said: \"This increase suggests\n\n[that] the decline seen in net migration on a quarterly basis since the year\n\nending June 2011 has not continued.\" The halt in the fall in net migration was a\n\nresult of fewer British and EU citizens leaving the UK. Mr Cameron and Theresa\n\nMay, the Home Secretary, have pledged to reduce net migration to less than\n\n100,000 by the election. The difficulty they face in driving down net migration\n\nis that they can do very little to curb immigration from the EU.\n\n\n\nLegislation paving the way for the 2017 referendum is being pushed through\n\nParliament by the Tory MP James Wharton. Yesterday a bid by another Tory, Adam\n\nAfriye, to hold the vote before the election was defeated in the Commons. Just\n\n14 other MPs backing him.\n\n\n\nQ Which, if any, of the following do you think are the most NEGATIVE effects of\n\nimmigration? Please tick up to three\n\n\n\nIncreased pressure on public services 49%\n\n\n\nIncreased pressure on and shortage of housing 42%\n\n\n\nImmigrants taking jobs that could be filled by British people 36%\n\n\n\nCommunity tensions between racial groups 30%\n\n\n\nBritain becoming less British 24%\n\n\n\nIncreased crime 23%\n\n\n\nVulnerability to terrorism or extremism 20%\n\n\n\nDownwards pressure on wages 16%\n\n\n\nOther 1%\n\n\n\nNone - no negative effects 3%\n\n\n\nDon't know 6%\n\n\n\n"

He also warned that his party risked losing the\n\n2015 election if it failed to bring forward the proposed referendum from 2017 to\n\n2014. \"I say in all humility and kindness to my colleagues that, by chasing the\n\nEU referendum dream for 2017, we risk losing one in 2014 and throwing away the\n\n2015 election,\" he said. \"I urge every MP to listen to their constituents and to\n\ntry, through one of the amendments, to grant the British people a referendum in\n\n2014.\"\n\n\n\nThe MP for Windsor's amendment was not voted upon amid predictions that he will\n\nonly get the backing of between five and 20 MPs.\n\n\n\nThe debate came as Carlos Ghosn, the head of Nissan, told the BBC that his\n\ncompany could withdraw from Britain if the UK left the EU. \"If anything has to\n\nchange we [would] need to reconsider our strategy and our investments for the\n\nfuture,\" he said. Were Nissan to leave, 6,500 Jobs at the company's Sunderland\n\nsite would be lost.\n\n\n\nEd Miliband, the Labour leader, was dismissive of the Bill, which was promised\n\nby David Cameron Just before local elections in May to draw support away from\n\nUKIP.\n\n\n\n\"I think what we see today is the Conservative Party talking to itself about\n\nEurope when actually what they should be doing is talking to the country about\n\nthe most important issue that people are facing, which is the cost of living\n\ncrisis,\" he said.\n\n\n\nClaire Perry, the government whip, accused the Opposition on Twitter of \"playing\n\nsilly buggers\". The Labour MP Graham Jones responded during a Twitter\n\nconversation that he did not \"appreciate attempt to physically pick me up nor\n\nwhips threats\".\n\n\n\nThe issue of Europe prompted a ferocious clash between Nigel Farage, the UKIP\n\nleader, and Anna Soubry, the Conservative Defence Minister, on Question Time the\n\nnight before yesterday's debate. She described Mr Farage as a \"scaremonger\" who\n\n\"put fear in people's hearts\" over immigration.\n\n\n\nMr Farage, who had warned on the BBC programme about a possible influx of\n\nRomanians and Bulgarians when controls on their movements into Britain are\n\nlifted next year, said yesterday that Ms Soubry's attack showed that the\n\n\"political class\" were getting concerned about UKIP.\n\n\n\nHe said he had been comparing the Government's apparent lack of concern about\n\nthe issue with the Labour Government's prediction that only 13,000 would move to\n\nBritain from Poland and other eastern European countries after 2004 when EU\n\nfreedom of movement rules came into force. In the end, more than one million\n\narrived.\n\n\n\nThe referendum Bill will return before the Commons on November 22.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIn UK businesses, small and large, there are definite signs of greater economic\n\nactivity. The not-sogood news is that we still have it all to do. This is Asia's\n\ncentury and becoming globally competitive is a Herculean work-in-progress.\n\nWhat's more, we belong to a European club that is holding us back and if it is\n\nunreformed it will render the task impossible.\n\n\n\nSome argue that discussing EU membership is a distraction from the task of\n\neconomic recovery. They are wrong. The nature of our membership is intrinsically\n\nlinked to our chances of making our recovery sustainable. We must not delay\n\naddressing it.\n\n\n\nAlthough its 530 million people have enJoyed nearly 70 years of uninterrupted\n\npeace, the EU looks set to fall at the first hurdle in the Global Competitive\n\nStakes. It is simply not fit for purpose.\n\n\n\nWe are faced with an unelected ruling elite in Brussels that still can't balance\n\nits books, where the culture is still one of marching valiantly towards 1970 and\n\nwhere criticism is condescendingly seen as heretical.\n\n\n\nThe dead hand of EU-based employment regulation and state subsidies has been a\n\nJob destroyer for years. Money that should be invested in education is instead\n\nsunk in the Common Agricultural Policy. Brussels spends billions of euros on\n\noverseas aid yet debilitates those same developing countries with tariffs that\n\nprevent them creating sustainable economies that would extinguish the need for\n\naid in the first place.\n\n\n\nIn some rival countries within the EU, compliance with uncompetitive regulation,\n\nfrom environmental standards to procurement, from financial markets to fishing,\n\nis almost voluntary. There is no EU-wide inspection and compliance structure.\n\nThe good guys comply and become uncompetitive. The single market is vital, but\n\nafter decades of haggling there is still no single market in services. This is\n\nparticularly disadvantageous to Britain, which has Europe's largest services\n\nsector.\n\n\n\nFor the good of every single person living in the 28 member states of the EU,\n\nall this must change, and change quickly. Globalisation does not take prisoners.\n\nThis should not be about the UK seeking opt-outs and exemptions Just for us.\n\nFundamental reform is not Just about helping an unemployed kid in Manchester or\n\nCardiff but Madrid and Lisbon too.\n\n\n\nThe alternative to continent-wide reform is permanently high unemployment,\n\nespecially among the young. The resulting social dislocation will make Greece's\n\ncurrent woes look like a walk in the park. The worrying rise of the Far Right in\n\nmany member states, including France, has an excellent recruiting sergeant: mass\n\nyouth unemployment and a perception that economic policies are implemented by\n\nunaccountable bureaucrats.\n\n\n\nIf Germany and the UK really want to lead a Europe that can give Asia a run for\n\nits money, then let us have independent enforcement of regulation, massive\n\nreform of fisheries and agriculture, huge investment in Europe-wide technical\n\nestablishments, abolition of trade protectionism and serious slimming of the\n\nbureaucracy in Brussels. But will it happen? I fear not. My experience leads me\n\nto believe that the chances of certain big countries changing things is nil.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister's plan to negotiate reform and then ask the British people to\n\naffirm or reJect continuing membership would create a long period of uncertainty\n\nfor business. It would be better to hold a referendum as soon as possible and\n\nend the uncertainty. David Cameron will get minor adJustments here and there but\n\nhe won't get the sort of reform upon which our future membership should be\n\nconditional. If anyone, the CBI included, thinks that fundamental reform is on\n\nthe EU agenda, they are deluding themselves.\n\n\n\nLeaving is not, as some pretend, such an unattractive option. There is a lie put\n\nabout that three million Jobs depend on our continued membership. Not true.\n\nThere would be free trade agreements in place the day after our exit. Germany\n\nwould demand no less. We would be free to negotiate, at more than the current\n\nglacial pace, free trade agreements with the rest of the world.\n\n\n\nWe are told that we would have to comply with EU regulations without having any\n\ninfluence over their design. What influence? We have secured a nudge here, a sop\n\nthere, a delay in implementation perhaps, but no real, hard influence. Why is\n\nthe UK with its enormous market share of EU financial services faced with so\n\nmuch uncompetitive regulation forced upon it by Brussels? Dubai, Shanghai and\n\nMumbai are laughing in anticipation.\n\n\n\nWe certainly must put the option of leaving on the negotiating table. The tactic\n\nof promising to stay in the EU regardless of what the Prime Minister can\n\nnegotiate is insane. When did anyone start negotiations with \"It's OK, we don't\n\nmean it, we will do what you want anyway\" as an opening gambit? Staying in a\n\nreformed Europe has to be the right course, but should we stay in the current\n\nmess? Frankly, our nation Just can't afford to if we are to provide our\n\ngrandchildren with a globally competitive economy worthy of the name.\n\n\n\nDigby Jones is a former director-general of the CBI and was Minister for Trade\n\nand Investment, 2007-08\n\n\n\nWe need a referendum as soon as possible to end the uncertainty\n\n\n\n"

Frankly, our nation Just can't afford to if we are to provide our\n\ngrandchildren with a globally competitive economy.\" Lord Jones's intervention\n\ncomes days before the Commons is due to vote on a Bill legislating for a\n\nreferendum on British membership of the European Union by 2017. The Tories are\n\nexpecting to back the Private Member's Bill of James Wharton in overwhelming\n\nnumbers with between Just 5 and 20 rebels.\n\n\n\nIt will pass despite attempts by some Labour MPs, such as Mike Gapes, to use\n\nprocedural tricks to scupper its passage.\n\n\n\nMr Gapes has already put down 86 amendments to the EU Referendum Bill, even\n\nthough the Bill itself is only one page long.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are also concerns in government that the Bill, which has the\n\nbacking of the Prime Minister, may fall when it reaches the House of Lords next\n\nyear, which would leave a Tory party, currently experiencing a period of rare\n\nunity on Europe, in disarray.\n\n\n\nLord Jones attacks the scare tactics of those who want to stay in the EU. He\n\ncalls the Government's claim that three million Jobs depend on our continued\n\nmembership a \"lie\", adding: \"Leaving is not, as some pretend, such an\n\nunattractive option.\" He writes: \"There is a lie put about that. Not true. There\n\nwould be free-trade agreements in place the day after our exit. Germany would\n\ndemand no less. We would be free to negotiate, at more than the current glacial\n\npace, free-trade agreements with the rest of the world.\" Lord Jones backs the\n\nPrime Minister's decision to seek agreement among all 28 members, warning that\n\nthe alternative would push voters into the arms of extremist parties.\n\n\n\n\"This should not be about the UK seeking opt-outs and exemptions Just for us.\n\nFundamental reform is not Just about helping an unemployed kid in Manchester or\n\nCardiff but Madrid and Lisbon too.

The row could also strengthen calls for tougher data\n\nprotection laws, which are opposed by David Cameron.\n\n\n\nArriving in Brussels, Mrs Merkel said that it was \"really not on\" for friends to\n\nspy on each other. Speaking hours after her Government summoned the US\n\nambassador in Berlin, the German Chancellor told reporters: \"It's not just about\n\nme, but about every German citizen. We need to have trust in our allies and\n\npartners, and this trust must now be established once again.\"\n\n\n\nA key ally of Mrs Merkel announced that Germany might force the suspension of\n\nfree trade talks between the United States and the European Union. Gunther\n\nKrichbaum, head of the Bundestag's EU committee, called on the talks to be\n\nhalted. He told the BBC that wire-tapping was a scandal and that we \"need to put\n\nthe transatlantic trade agreement on hold\".\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister has made the trade deal an important part of his effort to\n\nconvince Britons to stay in the EU ahead of the 2017 referendum, launching it\n\nwith President Obama earlier in the year at a summit in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\nThe EU has been negotiating with Washington to create what would be the world's\n\nlargest free trade area, with more than 800 million inhabitants. Mr Cameron\n\nwants to hold it up as an example of the benefits the EU can bring for Britain.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said that Britain would try to head off any attempt\n\nto scupper the deal.\n\n\n\nHowever, other European politicians supported Germany. Martin Schulz, the\n\nPresident of the European Parliament, said of negotiations: \"I believe that we\n\nhave to interrupt again.\"\n\n\n\nFrance also signalled support, but Fredrik Reinfeldt,Swedish Prime Minister,\n\nsaid that the affair would not affect the talks on the agreement. British and\n\nFrench diplomats expressed surprise that the allegations had caused much\n\ncontroversy. Bernard Squarcini, head of the French domestic intelligence agency\n\nuntil last year, said: \"It seems that our politicians don't read the reports we\n\nsend them. The agencies know that all countries carry out surveillance on their\n\nallies. The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial front just as\n\nwe spy on them.\"\n\n\n\nThe former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that France\n\neavesdropped on her when she was in government. \"This is not a surprise -\n\ncountries spy on each other,\" she said.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron faced being dragged into the row after Italian weekly L'Espresso\n\nreported that British intelligence services had been monitoring Italian telecoms\n\nnetworks, targeting the government and companies as well as suspected terrorist\n\ngroups.\n\n\n\nThe report, based on evidence from former whistleblower Edward Snowden, said\n\nthat documents held by Snowden \"contain a great deal of information on the\n\ncontrol of Italian telecommunications which will be released in the next few\n\nweeks\". Asked about L'Espresso's report, Enrico Letta, the Italian Prime\n\nMinister, said: \"It is inconceivable and unacceptable that there should be acts\n\nof espionage of this type.\"\n\n\n\nLast night The Guardian reported that the US National Security Agency had\n\nmonitored the phone conversations of 35 world leaders after being given the\n\nnumbers by US government departments, including the White House.\n\n\n\nThe White House denied that it had monitored Mr Cameron's communications at any\n\ntime, while refusing to provide similar clarification on Mrs Merkel. Asked by\n\nThe Times whether Mr Cameron's communications had ever been subject to US\n\ngovernment monitoring, Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security\n\nCouncil, said: \"The answer is no.\"\n\n\n\nOn Mrs Merkel, she was less specific, saying: \"The United States is not\n\nmonitoring and will not monitor the communications of Chancellor Merkel. Beyond\n\nthat, I'm not in a position to comment publicly on every specific alleged\n\nintelligence activity.\"\n\n\n\n"

Asked whether the SPD supported\n\nMr Cameron's goal, Axel SchÃ¤fer, deputy chairman of the party's parliamentary\n\ngroup, said simply: \"No.\"\n\n\n\nHe was equally frank when asked about Mr Cameron's intention to reverse the goal\n\nof closer union. \"Never,\" he said. \"The SPD calls for the strengthening of the\n\nEU institutions.\"\n\n\n\nMrs Merkel needs SPD support to beef up EU control over national budgets. She\n\nwants binding contracts on borrowing and deficit levels overseen by the European\n\nCommission. Mr SchÃ¤fer warned that the SPD would not back her if she continued\n\nto help Mr Cameron to take back powers.\n\n\n\n\"The SPD will not support any [EU treaty] settlements if Merkel conducts\n\nparallel negotiations with David Cameron over the transfer of EU competences\n\nback to member states,\" he told Der Spiegel. Mr SchÃ¤fer added that his party was\n\nagainst any new treaty that would require approval in a referendum.\n\n\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Mrs Merkel can retain full control over EU policy\n\nin her third term, as she did in coalition with the right-wing Free Democrats.\n\n\n\nThe SPD is determined to win a series of concessions as the price of forming a\n\ncoalition, most centred on domestic policy, with a minimum wage of (EURO)8.50\n\ntop of its shopping list. They will not want to appear a pushover in foreign\n\npolicy, however. Leading article, page 28\n\n\n\n"

It signed a Â£1.2 billion contract to build a new generation of\n\ninter-city trains for Britain's railways this year, with carriages to be\n\ncompleted at a factory in Newton Aycliffe, Co Durham, guaranteeing 730 Jobs\n\ndirectly, plus many more among suppliers.\n\n\n\nHitachi also paid Â£700 million last year for Horizon Nuclear Power, which is\n\nplanning to build reactors on Anglesey and in Oldbury, Gloucestershire. Each\n\nsite is expected to employ 6,000 people if construction goes ahead.\n\n\n\nYet the company has added its voice to mounting anxiety in the overseas business\n\ncommunity over Britain's likely referendum on EU membership.

Mr Shiga said he would be particularly\n\nconcerned if, after a UK exit from Europe's free trade area, the rest of the EU\n\nbegan imposing a tariff on British-made goods. \"If the EU side put import duties\n\non the UK, that would be a big obstacle. It depends what happens after leaving,\"\n\nMr Shiga said.\n\n\n\nBritain's carmaking sector has been expanding rapidly. In the first quarter of\n\nlast year, the UK moved into a trade surplus in cars for the first time since\n\n1976. One in seven cars bought in Britain is made domestically and purchases of\n\nnew vehicles are on the increase: more than 403,000 cars were registered last\n\nmonth, the most since March 2007.\n\n\n\nOnly last month, the first Nissan Note rolled off Sunderland's production line.\n\nThe new \"supermini\" vehicle adds to production of the Qashqai, the Juke and the\n\nelectrically powered Leaf.\n\n\n\nNissan plans to make a model from its upmarket Infiniti range in Sunderland from\n\n2015 and Mr Shiga hinted that one more model could yet be added to the factory,\n\nwhich churns out 510,000 cars annually.\n\n\n\nThe Department for Business, Innovation and Skills declined to comment on the\n\nNissan boss's remarks. Labour said Nissan's stance underlined concerns about the\n\ncoalition's attempt to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU. Chuka Umunna,\n\nthe Shadow Business Secretary, said: \"These comments make it clear that millions\n\nof pounds of investment and thousands of jobs could be put at risk by the\n\nTory-led Government's attitude to the EU. Nissan's comments underline that\n\nBritain's place within the EU is essential to us being able to compete, attract\n\ninvestment and pay our way in the world.\"\n\n\n\nNissan has consistently praised its British workforce. Announcing its extra\n\ninvestment in the plant last month, it credited Sunderland with setting \"an\n\ninternational benchmark for productivity and quality\".\n\n\n\nNissan is Japan's second-largest carmaker, behind Toyota.\n\n\n\nUnique UK regulations would be an obstacle Toshiyuki Shiga\n\n\n\n"

He has given his backing to a\n\nPrivate Member's Bill that enshrines that pledge in legislation.\n\n\n\nWriting in The Mail on Sunday, Mr Afriyie said that voters were \"not convinced\"\n\nthat the Prime Minister would stick to his word if re-elected in 2015.\n\n\n\nThe MP for Windsor said that he would table an amendment to the Bill, due to\n\nreturn to the Commons next month, that would bring the promise forward to 2014\n\nto see off the threat of UKIP.\n\n\n\nMr Afriyie, a backbencher who recently launched an unlikely leadership effort,\n\nsaid that his \"conscience\" had forced him to put forward the idea. It was met\n\nwith widespread scepticism from across the party.\n\n\n\nDowning Street immediately dismissed the proposal, while Theresa May, the Home\n\nSecretary, warned that his amendment could Jeopardise the existing Bill.\n\n\n\nEven Daniel Hannan, an MEP and one of the most vehement opponents of Britain's\n\nmembership of the EU, urged MPs to oppose it. Veteran Tory Eurosceptic MPs knew\n\nnothing of the rebel amendment until one of their number was telephoned by\n\nDowning Street on Saturday night. They were irked that they had not been\n\nconsulted. \"Mr Afriyie is not normally the person who leads Eurosceptic\n\nrebellions,\" one remarked.\n\n\n\nAnother said that the proposal would be awkward for MPs under threat from UKIP,\n\nwho would feel compelled to support it. \"It's an odd position to put your\n\nfriends in,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe views of Eurosceptics could change if Ed Miliband throws his weight behind\n\nthe amendment, offering the prospect of winning the vote.\n\n\n\nTom Watson, the prominent Labour MP who was until recently the party's election\n\nstrategist, said yesterday that he would support Mr Afriyie.\n\n\n\nHis stance will put pressure on Mr Miliband, who is already facing calls from\n\nsome senior figures to call the Prime Minister's bluff on Europe by pushing for\n\nan early referendum. Those close to him sought yesterday to play down the idea\n\nof supporting Mr Afriyie in the Commons.\n\n\n\nChuka Umunna, the Shadow Business Secretary, said that such a move would be bad\n\nfor business.\n\n\n\nNigel Farage, the UKIP leader, said he would be \"absolutely delighted\" with a\n\nvote in 2014, even though an early referendum could leach support from his\n\nparty. The MEP refused to deny reports that he had chosen South Thanet as his\n\ntarget for Westminster at the next general election.\n\n\n\nHalf of all voters want to see Nigel Farage take part in televised election\n\ndebates, an opinion poll by YouGov has found. A total of 49 per cent said that\n\nthey wanted the UKIP leader to be given a podium alongside David Cameron, Ed\n\nMiliband and Nick Clegg.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI am heading up to Manchester this morning to attend the Tory Conference. I will\n\nbe addressing three fringe meetings and will spend the morning canvassing in a\n\nSalford local by-election.\n\n\n\nIt seems I am persona non grata, barred from the secure zone, which is amusing\n\ngiven that about half the attendees at the conference are lobbyists from all\n\nover the world with all or no political allegiances and paying handsomely for\n\nthe privilege. To the Tory High Command I am a plague carrier.\n\n\n\nAll of which makes the recent Unite the Right campaign extraordinarily unlikely\n\nto work.\n\n\n\nMy message at the conference is that the 2014 European parliamentary elections\n\nrepresent a huge opportunity. The rise of UKIP has by any measure changed the\n\nnational debate. I now hear echoes of our policy platform with every new\n\nstatement coming out of the Tory machine. There is the new tougher take on\n\nimmigration. There is the small concession on the marriage allowance and, unlike\n\nlast year, there is the distant promise of a referendum.\n\n\n\nI am in no doubt that without the significant rise of UKIP across the country\n\nthere would be no referendum pledge. Mr Cameron had repeatedly said that he does\n\nnot want an in/out referendum, but today he proudly claims to do so.\n\n\n\nI believe that at these coming Euro elections those Conservatives who believe,\n\nas we do, in our national independence should lend their vote to UKIP. This will\n\nhelp to toughen up the referendum message and could even bring forward a promise\n\nthat is still four long years away. As the former CBI Director-General Lord\n\nJones said, four years would be a \"very long period of uncertainty\".\n\n\n\nSecond, a huge UKIP success next year will not Just cause an earthquake in\n\nWestminster, the tremors will be felt across the Channel in Brussels. This in\n\nitself could possibly, though still improbably, create a situation where the\n\npowers at the EU top table may be minded to offer the concessions on which Mr\n\nCameron has staked his reputation.\n\n\n\nFor the first time, a big UKIP vote could finally convince them that the people\n\nof Britain could well vote to leave, which they do not want to happen. So a big\n\nUKIP vote could help Mr Cameron with his negotiations. My emphasis is on the\n\nnext elections, which of course does not mean the general election but those on\n\nMay 22 next year.\n\n\n\nDespite all this there is endless speculation about possible deals between UKIP\n\nand the Tories. But all those suggesting deals are missing the point. UKIP is\n\ncreating its own political ground. Every Thursday there are local council\n\nby-elections across the country in which our vote share is getting stronger and\n\nstronger. In the past few weeks we have been averaging more than 25 per cent and\n\nonly last Thursday we took a seat off Labour in Kent with a huge swing. In the\n\npast year or so we have scored highly in Westminster by-elections, coming second\n\nin the Labour seats of South Shields, Rotherham, Barnsley and Middlesbrough.\n\n\n\nAs YouGov has shown, many if not most of our supporters do not want a deal.\n\nHowever, the real reason that all this talk of a deal is nonsensical is that Mr\n\nCameron despises us, his own board excludes me from debate and we are viewed by\n\nthe high command as in some way from the lower orders.\n\n\n\nBesides which we are diametrically opposed to almost everything that Mr Cameron\n\nhas championed since he became Tory leader, the most recent case being his\n\ndesire to take us to war in Syria. UKIP was implacably opposed to military\n\naction without the necessary knowledge of why and of what outcome was desired.\n\n\n\nA few Lynton Crosby press releases in the past few months suggesting a change in\n\ndirection lack sincerity and are Just not credible. An immigration- poster truck\n\ndoes not make a philosophy.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite the way that the Tory leadership feels there are individuals,\n\nsuch as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Peter Bone, who feel differently. If they, or others\n\nlike them - even Labour MPs - with their local associations chose to propose\n\nrunning on a Joint ticket, then I would leave the local UKIP association to have\n\nthose negotiations. If after discussions they feel that it would be a better way\n\nto serve their constituents, then I and the National Executive Committee would\n\nbe happy to hear reasoning. After all, we are a party that believes in real\n\nlocalism and doesn't think that the centre is the repository of all wisdom.\n\n\n\nBut I suspect that Conservative Central Office would crush such innovative\n\nthinking.\n\n\n\nNigel Farage is the leader of the UK Independence Party\n\n\n\nWe believe in localism. The centre isn't the source of all wisdom\n\n\n\n"

Many of Graham Brady\n\nMP's predecessors as the shop steward for Tory MPs did not give media interviews\n\nat all. Mr Brady has been more publicly assertive and has occasionally cast\n\nvotes in the House of Commons that have not pleased David Cameron. He is part of\n\none of the most interesting features of today's politics - a backbench\n\nparliamentary party that thinks for itself and is not easily whipped.\n\n\n\nIn an interview for today's Times, Mr Brady again asserts his independence of\n\nmind by encouraging the Tory leadership to clarify its position on Europe. His\n\nwords are carefully couched but his message is clear. He wants David Cameron to\n\nbe clearer about what he is seeking to achieve in the forthcoming attempt to\n\nrenegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels. Without \"a fundamental\n\nprogramme of reform\" he warns, there is a greater probability that the British\n\npeople will vote to leave the European Union in the referendum promised by the\n\nConservative Party.\n\n\n\nMr Brady is speaking for a large number of Conservative MPs who doubt the\n\nresolve of William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, to ensure Britain frees itself\n\nfrom substantial amounts of EU bureaucracy.\n\n\n\nJohn Redwood, for example, has described the review of competences being\n\nundertaken by the Foreign Office as a \"whitewash\". Mr Brady, Mr Redwood and\n\nother Tory MPs are right to worry about Britain's relationship with Europe.\n\n\n\nThe EU may not feature prominently on lists of voters' concerns but Europe's\n\ndirect impact on our lives - via border control, energy prices, agriculture, the\n\nfishing industry and the regulatory regime for British industry - is huge.\n\n\n\nIt would surely be better, however, for Tory MPs to focus on broader concerns,\n\nboth at their conference next week in Manchester and in the 18 months between\n\nnow and the next election. Over the past year David Cameron has moved in\n\nsignificant ways to produce a more authentic conservatism. Not just on Europe\n\nbut also on welfare, tax policy and immigration he has listened to backbench\n\nconcerns. Since he appointed Lynton Crosby as his campaign adviser he has run a\n\nsharper, more disciplined operation and his position in opinion polls has\n\nimproved. With the likes of Chris Grayling and Owen Paterson at the Cabinet\n\ntable, he leads a more balanced team.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the Conservative Party must now move too. We will know Mr Cameron's\n\nparty is fully deserving of office when - on the eve of future party conferences\n\n- its most prominent backbenchers are using media platforms to discuss the\n\nhousing crisis, the problem of low pay and the decline of social mobility.\n\n\n\nEd Miliband may have the wrong prescription for many of Britain's ills but he\n\nhas a good sense of what is ailing people - particularly those social groups\n\nthat are most vulnerable to the ups and downs of the world economy. While more\n\nvoters trust the Conservative Party to mend the economy, more voters think that\n\nthe Labour Party is likelier to protect their own families' incomes.\n\n\n\nThe challenge for the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is to\n\nfind ways of changing the fear that gains from economic growth won't reach every\n\ncorner of Britain. Grassroots and elected Tories should not distract them from\n\nthat challenge. Ideally, they should be doing much more to help them meet it.\n\n\n\n"

He\n\nsaid that Mr Cameron \"fully understands and accepts\" the need for the party to\n\nhave a say in any powersharing talks with the Liberal Democrats, but it is his\n\ninsistence that Mr Cameron starts to lay out his EU negotiating position in the\n\nmanifesto for the European elections that will cause the most unease in No 10.\n\n\n\nSo far Mr Cameron has resisted pressure to go into detail about which powers he\n\nwould demand back, on the ground that it would be unwise to reveal his hand\n\nbefore talks with other leaders.\n\n\n\nHis silence also helps to keep the peace within the party over the nature of the\n\nfuture relationship with the EU.\n\n\n\nIn a reference to UKIP, Mr Brady said that the low turnout at European elections\n\nmake them \"particularly sensitive for people seeking to use them for a war\n\nmessage\" and that the Tories must therefore spell out their position.\n\n\n\n\"I think we should be very clear about what we want, about renegotiating the EU\n\ntreaties. We've been very clear that the public will have the final say about\n\n[whether] what we negotiate is acceptable or not, but I think it's essential to\n\nbe up-front and clear and we also need to be really quite radical.\n\n\n\n\"The irony of all this is that, in my view, if we don't achieve quite a radical\n\nrenegotiation of our relationship with the European Union, the likelihood of the\n\nBritish public choosing to leave is much greater.\" Mr Brady was sacked by Mr\n\nCameron for his support for grammar schools in 2007 but was elected by backbench\n\nTory MPs to represent them as chairman of the 1922 Committee. He said that he\n\nand Mr Cameron had \"regular conversations\" and that it would be odd if the\n\nsubJect of future coalitions hadn't been raised. \"I think he fully understands\n\nand accepts that should we not win an overall MAJORITY that the party would need\n\nto be more involved in the decision process\".\n\n\n\nMr Cameron is on course to have faced the most rebellious parliament for the\n\npast 70 years, but Mr Brady defended the right of MPs to defy the leadership.\n\n\n\nIncreasing demands from constituents that MPs represent their interests is\n\nchanging the nature of British politics, he said, and governments should respond\n\naccordingly.\n\n\n\n\"There are some inherent tensions in our parliamentary system of government\n\nwhich I think are becoming much harder to reconcile and I think that we should\n\nsee a further movement of the strengthening of Parliament. I would like to see,\n\nat the very least, some committees have more power and resources to scrutinise\n\nwhat the government does.\"\n\n\n\n"

Ms Merkel may be\n\ncrowned in the world's press as the new Queen of Europe - it is possible to\n\ngovern in times of austerity and yet flourish at the ballot box! - but the\n\ncelebratory mood will soon curdle. What we witnessed on Sunday night was the\n\nbeginning of the end of the Merkel era.\n\n\n\nInitially, seen through the bluetinted specs of David Cameron, Mrs Merkel's\n\nclear superiority over the opposition Social Democrats, a 16 per cent lead, must\n\nhave seemed like an extraordinary encouragement. Had she won an absolute\n\nmajority she would have reassured disgruntled Tories that there was life after\n\nmarriage with the Lib Dems, indeed suggested that European liberalism may be on\n\nthe way out; that Social Democrat/Labour voters were not stirred by fear of\n\nsqueezed living standards; and the German equivalent of UKIP, the Alternative\n\nfor Germany, was pushed to the margins. Now all the German Chancellor had to do\n\nwas to side explicitly with Britain on the repatriation of powers from Brussels\n\nand the sun would shine again on the Anglo-German relationship.\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to underestimate the current, often irrational Tory admiration\n\nfor the German leader. By falling short of an absolute majority, however, Ms\n\nMerkel is now condemned to do a deal with the Social Democrats. The implosion of\n\nher Free Democrat partner means she has been shorn of options on the centre\n\nright. That is bad news for a British Government counting on Ms Merkel to\n\ndeliver flanking support on European reform ahead of a referendum. The Social\n\nDemocrats want Marshall Plan-style assistance for the weaker eurozone members,\n\nthey want a German socialist as head of the European Commission and they don't\n\nwant any British opt-outs. Helping Britain out of a political squeeze would come\n\na long way down the priority list of a Christian Democrat-Social Democrat\n\ngovernment.\n\n\n\nForming this so-called grand coalition will be more complex than the last\n\nattempt in 2005. Christian Democrats will demand a government that reflects\n\ntheir dominant position in the election.\n\n\n\nThe Social Democrats meanwhile have two strategic options: they can join a\n\nMerkel-led team with the secret intention of pulling out mid-term. Or they can\n\nstay in opposition under a new leadership that starts to open the party to a\n\ndeal with the more radical left party. The paradox of Merkel's victory might be\n\nthat it causes the splintered left-wing parties of Germany to make common cause\n\nin time for the 2017 election.\n\n\n\nTo outsiders, the meagre Social Democrat result seemed like another stone in the\n\ncenotaph of the European Left. Instead it may position the Left, and the trade\n\nunion movement, for the looming post-Merkel era.\n\n\n\nIn coalition politics, the game is up when you run out of potential partners.\n\nGrand coalitions, grouping the two major parties, smack of desperation. Yet\n\nthere are no serious alternatives left for the Chancellor. A minority government\n\nwould find itself blocked by the upper house of parliament. Having pulled\n\nGermany abruptly out of nuclear power after Fukushima, Ms Merkel might just be\n\nable to recruit the Greens into a government should negotiations with the Social\n\nDemocrats fail over the coming weeks. That would harness Bavarian conservatives,\n\nas carnivorous as Texans, with a party that has been demanding office canteens\n\nintroduce a vegetables-only day every week. It would be a veritable kitchen\n\nnightmare, a recipe for permanent instability.\n\n\n\nThe next German government will turn inwards. Labour market flexibility, the key\n\nto German competitiveness, will shrink. The Social Democrats will make an\n\n(EURO)8.50 national hourly minimum wage a precondition for joining a government.\n\nGermany's high employment rate is pumped up by a great many shortterm and\n\npart-time workers. The country is not the uniformly prosperous society it is\n\ncracked up to be: inner cities in the de-industrialised part of the Ruhr look\n\nrun down, autobahn bridges are being closed because of serious investment\n\nshortfall. Some 6.2 million people are on social welfare payments.\n\n\n\nThe most plausible reading of the German public mood is that voters want\n\ngovernment to shift away from saving the eurozone and towards rescuing the\n\nFatherland from neglect. Is Angela Merkel ready to deliver? On Sunday, behind\n\nthe forced smile, she looked terrified. She has reached her zenith. From here on\n\nin, her political space starts to shrivel. This will be her third term in\n\noffice, and her last.\n\n\n\nHelping Britain out of a political squeeze will not be a priority\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDear William, The Foreign Office review of the balances of EU competences -\n\ndocumenting the powers that Brussels has over Britain - is important work. The\n\ntitle may not be catchy, but it is about our democracy and identity as a nation.\n\n\n\nThe six chapters published so far read as whitewash to justify the existing\n\nsettlement. The reader is alerted to the overarching bias of the exercise in the\n\nfirst sentence: \"Membership of the EU is in the UK's national interests.\" We are\n\ntold that the single market brings \"appreciable economic benefits\" that outweigh\n\ncosts. We are assured the EU's involvement in tax, especially where it has\n\nharmonised a whole tax area through VAT, is good news. In health the review\n\nwelcomes the free movement of people and wants a bigger EU role in public\n\nhealth. We are told how it is strongly in the UK's interest to work through the\n\nEU in a number of policy areas. Surely the review should only conclude on the\n\nbalance of the UK's national interest once the whole exercise is complete? Why\n\nhave the voices that disagree been given so little attention?\n\n\n\nThe FCO should start with an honest catalogue of all the powers the EU now\n\nenjoys. Political parties can then set out which powers should be brought back\n\nto the UK and which continue at EU level. It will doubtless shock many people\n\njust how much power the EU enjoys. It would give federalists the chance to\n\nexplain why they think so many powers are better exercised at the EU level than\n\nin our own elected institutions.\n\n\n\nA new relationship is www.crucial.UK businesses largely favour the idea of a\n\nfree trade area. They want market access but do not see the need for this to be\n\nbuttressed by the EU regulating and deciding so much. Other EU countries are\n\nlikely to want this as well as they wish to carry on selling as much into the UK\n\nas they do today.\n\n\n\nThe euro has created new problems. The UK is not a member and is unlikely to\n\nbecome one. For that reason alone we need a new relationship, as all the mutual\n\nliabilities and extra rules that are needed in a single currency zone are not\n\nneeded www.here.UK voters have no wish to bail out foreign banks, send more tax\n\nrevenue to poorer EU countries or have our national budgets controlled by EU\n\nofficials.\n\n\n\nOur democracy needs a new relationship. When the UK first signed up to\n\nmembership of the EEC and voted \"yes\" in 1975, politicians assured people that\n\nour sovereignty was not at risk. Things have changed mightily since then, but\n\nthe people have not been given another say in a referendum.\n\n\n\nI would urge you to take a personal interest in this. The six early chapters of\n\nthe review fall well short of what is needed and do not reflect the strong body\n\nof opinion in this country that regards EU interference in UK lawmaking and\n\ngovernment as excessive.\n\n\n\nYour officials should cite the relevant treaty provisions, and important court\n\ncases, and list the many directives and regulations in each chapter of the\n\nreview. Far from protecting our national ability to make all decisions in\n\nimportant areas such as borders, taxation and welfare, we see an increasing\n\ninterference in these most sensitive of areas under the treaties.\n\n\n\nThe Conservative parliamentary party opposed the Nice, Amsterdam and Lisbon\n\ntreaties on the very grounds that these treaties took excessive powers away from\n\nthe UK. Their provisions put far too many areas of policy under EU control.\n\nConservatives have not suddenly changed their minds to welcome the wide range of\n\npowers taken from us under these three treaties, and we look to you to ensure\n\nour views are reflected in the Review of Competences.\n\n\n\nMany Conservatives also think that too much power has been taken away in the\n\nname of the \"single market\". This has become a device to push through an\n\nextensive legislative programme, extending the powers of European government. It\n\nis difficult, for example, to see what extra trade and industry the extensive\n\nenergy measures have generated, leaving the EU with much dearer energy than our\n\ncompetitors in the US and Asia.\n\n\n\nConservatives are united in wanting a new relationship.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope's leaders, sapped by crisis, have been dropping like chestnuts in autumn.\n\nNineteen have been toppled or given a pasting in the past three years. Yet\n\nAngela Merkel is about to be re-elected for a third term as German Chancellor\n\nlater this month, her Christian Democrats enjoying a clear 15-point lead over\n\nthe opposition. A narcoleptically dull TV duel that dodged foreign policy or\n\nirksome questions about the country's future only confirmed to voters what they\n\nwanted to know: their Chancellor remains as austere as their budget and\n\nreassuringly dour. That is how Germans like their leaders nowadays.\n\n\n\nOn the face of it, Mrs Merkel's return should be good news for David Cameron.\n\nSince November, when she came to Downing Street they have come to understand and\n\neven like each other. Mrs Merkel was charmed by it all: by Mr Cameron's personal\n\nlaptop presentation of Britain's role in Europe, by the lack of pomp and the\n\nsense that Europe's problems could be approached rationally rather than in a\n\nstrutting, self-regarding Sarkozian way. Downing Street, with its absence of\n\nmarble, lends itself to that kind of chat even if Mrs Merkel's biographer,\n\nStefan Kornelius, describes it as more of a dog kennel than the nerve centre of\n\na national government.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister seems to have come away with the idea that Britain and\n\nGermany can make common cause in the lead-up to a referendum on Europe.\n\nTogether, as partners in thrift, we have blocked an EU budget proposal by\n\nFrance, Spain and Italy. We share a suspicion of the European Commission. There\n\nare hints that she would be sympathetic to Britain's desire to apply EU justice\n\nand home affairs rules more selectively. The Christian Democrats have been\n\ngnawing at the problems of a multispeed Europe for decades, since the 1994\n\nproposals of Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble (now Finance Minister) and Karl Lamers, which\n\npictured the continent as a set of over-lapping Olympic-style rings. They\n\nalready have an inkling of the concessions Britain would need on the road to a\n\nreferendum.\n\n\n\nThe big question, though, is unanswered: how hard is Mrs Merkel willing to fight\n\nto keep Britain in the EU? The British in their eagerness to avoid the chill of\n\nisolation seem to be miscalculating on at least three counts. First we must\n\nunderstand more about the German leader - her personal, emotional connection to\n\nEurope. The assumption has been that she has a fundamentally different view of\n\nEurope than her mentor Helmut Kohl. He was a West German Francophile with a\n\nsense that Europe had to be woven together politically to head off wars and\n\nguarantee prosperity. Mrs Merkel grew up in communist East Germany with no\n\nspecial relationship to France. Her concern appeared to be to make Europe\n\ncompetitive, efficient, tolerant and, latterly, robust enough to withstand\n\neconomic meltdown.\n\n\n\nThat is the Merkel with whom we can do business. Her East Germanness, however,\n\ngives another dimension to her European-ness. She came of age in a collapsing\n\nstate ruled by a collapsing ideology. In private and a few scattered public\n\ncomments she has made it plain that she fears the EU too may have its day, even\n\ncomparing it with the rise and fall of Maya civilisation. To keep the EU empire\n\nintact, she has manoeuvred for Greece not to be forced out of the eurozone. Mr\n\nCameron is counting on her doing the same for Britain. Yet her pledge to Greece\n\nhas never been open-ended; if Athens threatens to bring down the European\n\nedifice, she will make sure it gets kicked out. And while Britain is plainly\n\ndifferent, it will boil down for Mrs Merkel to price - to whether Britain wants\n\nmore than symbolic concessions. A Brexit could, in her cost-benefit analysis, be\n\nthe only way to head off the fate of those Mayas.\n\n\n\nSecond, although Ms Merkel is a shoo-in for re-election, it is not clear what\n\ncoalition will emerge after the September 22 election. If her present partner,\n\nthe Free Democratic Party polls less than 5 per cent, it will be out of\n\nparliament. That would make a coalition with the Social Democrats the only\n\noption. Although their leader, Peer Steinbrueck, is an avowed Churchill fan, he\n\nis against what he calls Ã  la carte EU membership, and will push for a much\n\ncloser axis with FranÃ§ois Hollande and will almost certainly back the spiky\n\nleft-wing federalist Martin Schulz to be the new head of the Commission. That\n\nsurely would be an adrenaline shot for those in the UK who want to leave the EU.\n\n\n\nFinally, Mrs Merkel has dropped hints to another biographer, Nikolaus Blome,\n\nthat she considers ten years in office long enough, that 60 is a good age to\n\nstart something new. She is 61 on July 17, 2015, and will have had a decade as\n\nChancellor. If her party is to find a new candidate for the 2017 general\n\nelection, that is the moment to go. You could see it in the TV duel this week:\n\nthe slog of managing first the financial, then the eurozone crisis, has\n\nflattened her, drained her of strength. So, here's the nub: Mr Cameron may be\n\nbuilding his Europe in-out strategy on the back of a political friendship that\n\nis not made to last. That's something else to worry about.\n\n\n\nShe may calculate that a British exit is the only way to save the EU\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron is failing to address the Conservatives' \"vulnerability\" to Nigel\n\nFarage and the UK Independence Party and has not yet done enough to reassure the\n\npublic on Europe, Andy Coulson says this week.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister's former director of communications, who is awaiting trial on\n\ncharges of conspiracy to hack phones and conspiracy to commit misconduct in a\n\npublic office, makes the comments in the latest issue of GQ, which goes on sale\n\nthis week.\n\n\n\nIt represents Mr Coulson's first public intervention since May, when he\n\nsuggested that Mr Cameron knows Boris Johnson is after his job.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister has not done enough on Europe, opening a flank that could be\n\nexploited by UKIP, according to his former spin-doctor and former Editor of the\n\nNews of the World.\n\n\n\n\"Europe will, of course, continue to be the drum that UKIP bangs the loudest,\"\n\nMr Coulson writes. \"The Conservatives' post election in/out referendum promise\n\ntook the wind out of UKIP sails but more work will need to be done as next\n\nyear's European elections approach. On that issue, I'm in no doubt, William\n\nHague [the Foreign Secretary] is already burning the midnight oil.\"\n\n\n\nThe article does not suggest what further steps should be taken on Europe. Among\n\nthe options could be a promise to exit from the European Court of Human Rights,\n\nfor the Prime Minister to promise to campaign for an EU exit\n\n\n\nif he does not secure meaningful concessions.\n\n\n\nMr Coulson wants the Conservative leadership to realise that the party is\n\nmishandling the UKIP threat, and are wrong to cast UKIP members as \"fruitcakes,\n\nloonies and closet racists\" as Mr Cameron did in 2006. This only plays to Mr\n\nFarage's advantage, he suggests.\n\n\n\n\"As a result UKIP has become a club for disgruntled, invariably older Tories fed\n\nup with the leadership's attitude mostly, although not entirely, towards Europe.\n\nMore dangerously it allowed the party to present itself as the natural home for\n\nanyone fed up with mainstream politics.\"\n\n\n\nThe public flippancy, seen in comments by Ken Clarke, the Minister without\n\nPortfolio, this year that UKIP are \"clowns with no positive policies\", is\n\nmatched by private fear, he asserts.\n\n\n\nOne of the principle looming dangers comes over television debates. When working\n\nfor the Tories in opposition, Mr Coulson strongly argued against Mr Cameron's\n\nparticipation in such debates, warning that they represented an unnecessary risk\n\nbut was overruled by the Prime Minister.\n\n\n\nMr Coulson says that Mr Farage may have a \"bit of a point\" when he says that a\n\nUKIP \"win\" in the European elections should mean that he takes part in the\n\nleadership debates 12 months later, foreseeing a Twitter campaign to ensure his\n\nparticipation. \"The Conservatives should meet the UKIP debating challenge sooner\n\nand have Farage boxed off long before the first TV debate,\" he says. \"It should\n\nbe led by a senior Cabinet member, not the PM . . . .

This only plays to Mr\n\nFarage's advantage, he suggests.\n\n\n\n\"As a result UKIP has become a club for disgruntled, invariably older Tories fed\n\nup with the leadership's attitude mostly, although not entirely, towards Europe.\n\nMore dangerously it allowed the party to present itself as the natural home for\n\nanyone fed up with mainstream politics.\"\n\n\n\nThe public flippancy, seen in comments by Ken Clarke, the Minister without\n\nPortfolio, this year that UKIP are \"clowns with no positive policies\", is\n\nmatched by private fear, he asserts.\n\n\n\nOne of the principle looming dangers comes over television debates. When working\n\nfor the Tories in opposition, Mr Coulson strongly argued against Mr Cameron's\n\nparticipation in such debates, warning that they represented an unnecessary risk\n\nbut was overruled by the Prime Minister.\n\n\n\nMr Coulson says that Mr Farage may have a \"bit of a point\" when he says that a\n\nUKIP \"win\" in the European elections should mean that he takes part in the\n\nleadership debates 12 months later, foreseeing a Twitter campaign to ensure his\n\nparticipation.\n\n\n\n\"The Conservatives should meet the UKIP debating challenge sooner and have\n\nFarage boxed off long before the first TV debate,\" he says. \"It should be led by\n\na senior Cabinet member, not the PM . . . .

Signs of an economic recovery,\n\nunity around the European referendum pledge, the popularity of welfare policies\n\nand Labour infighting mean that Conservative MPs are in upbeat mood.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron is not getting carried away, however. Privately, his advisers\n\nconcede that it will be hard to win a parliamentary majority. Mr Cameron will\n\nbuck forty years of electoral precedents if he adds to the percentage of the\n\nTory vote at the next election. He'll also be attempting to perform this feat\n\nwith UKIP eating into his right flank and potentially detaching hundreds of\n\nthousands of supporters from his 2010 vote.\n\n\n\nIt's sensible therefore for the Tory leader and Britain's other leading\n\npoliticians to be preparing for the likelihood that there will be another hung\n\nParliament. Long-term changes to the electoral map mean we are not so much\n\nseeing the decline of the two-party system but the emergence of multiple\n\ntwo-party systems. In parts of Britain the battle remains between the Tories and\n\nLabour but there are also numerous seats where the battle is between nationalist\n\nparties such as the SNP and Labour; or between the Liberal Democrats and Labour\n\nin urban and northern Britain; and so on. It is increasingly tricky for any one\n\nparty to emerge victorious from this mosaic of two party contests.\n\n\n\nTwo factors made the coalition negotiations of 2010 relatively straightforward.\n\nFirst was the basic parliamentary arithmetic. Even if Nick Clegg had wanted to\n\nally with Gordon Brown the combination of Labour and Lib Dem MPs would not have\n\nadded up to a majority in the Commons. The second factor was the sense of\n\neconomic crisis that prevailed in May 2010. Tory and Lib Dem MPs who were not\n\nenthusiastic about the Cameron-Clegg alliance were warned that electors might\n\npunish them if they were seen to be putting the party before the national\n\ninterest.\n\n\n\nIf both a Lib-Lab and Lib-Con pact are numerically possible after the next\n\nelection the negotiating position of those Lib Dem MPs who are reelected will be\n\nstronger. At the same time many Tory MPs will refuse to be bounced into any deal\n\nby the threat of economic crisis. Talks could become protracted.\n\n\n\nOnce the votes are counted the influence of ordinary voters will be limited. It\n\nwill be politicians, in closed-door negotiations, who will decide who is our\n\nprime minister. Now is the time for voters to demand transparency from the\n\npolitical parties.\n\n\n\nAll of the party leaders should be expected to say which parts of their\n\nmanifestos might be given up in negotiations and which represent unbreakable\n\npromises. Will Mr Cameron, for example, abandon his EU referendum pledge if it\n\nmeans his welfare reforms can continue? It will be particularly important for\n\nthe Lib Dems, as likely kingmakers, to be transparent about how they will\n\nbehave. Will they prefer to support the party with the most votes or MPs or, on\n\nthe other hand, the party most likely to deliver on deficit reduction; or are\n\nthey willing to be \"bought\" by any party that offers them electoral reform or a\n\nmansion tax? And who will ratify any coalition agreement? Voters should know who\n\nthey are empowering when they vote Tory, Labour or Lib Dem. Are they giving\n\npower to the party leader, to MPs, to grassroot members or all three? Each party\n\nshould spell out how the formation of our likely next government and its\n\nprogramme might be agreed.\n\n\n\n"

Hopefully he'll\n\nappreciate some constructive advice from an unlikely source.\n\n\n\nMany of the Labour voices filling the airwaves seem to be advocating a radical\n\nchange of course: a substantial reshuffle, star hires and big changes in policy.\n\nThe volume of this chorus is more a reflection of the lack of news than the size\n\nof the problem. It's worth remembering that Labour only needs a three-point lead\n\nin the percentage of the vote to secure an overall majority, compared with an\n\n11-point lead needed by the Conservatives. And this is before the UKIP factor,\n\nwhich by eroding the Tory vote could easily scupper David Cameron's chance of\n\nstaying prime minister.\n\n\n\nSo with two key structural factors running in Labour's favour, Ed Miliband's\n\nteam shouldn't fall into a pit of despair.The first thing it should do is return\n\nto the most successful theme of his leadership.\n\n\n\nMr Miliband was the first to identify the \"squeezed middle\" as the battleground\n\non which the 2015 election will be fought, and Labour's recent focus on the\n\nrising cost of living at a time of stagnant wages is striking a chord with the\n\nelectorate. What is needed now are a few key policy changes that could deliver\n\npractical help to the \"squeezed middle\" and also stitch Labour's broad themes\n\ninto a coherent narrative.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, Labour need to make their fiscal policy add up. Their opposition\n\nto unpopular \"Tory cuts\" - not least the so-called bedroom tax - has no doubt\n\nplayed well with the party faithful, but every time they oppose deficit-reducing\n\nmeasures they undermine any sense that they can be trusted to balance the books.\n\nLabour needs to match the overall Tory spending envelope but find other ways of\n\noffering some differentiation.\n\n\n\nThe most readily available pot of cash is in the big, expensive infrastructure\n\nprojects. Of these the one with the biggest outlay and most flaky financial\n\ngrounding is high-speed rail. Only last month, the cost of HS2 was revised\n\nupwards from Â£30 billion to Â£42 billion, with some predicting that the figure\n\nwill rise above Â£70 billion. For this reason two big Labour beasts, Peter\n\nMandelson and Alistair Darling, have already switched sides and become\n\nopponents. The HS2 budget would be better invested in overcrowded and\n\nunelectrified commuter routes, and to reduce the cost of the daily commute for\n\npeople who have seen fares increase by more than 50 per cent in the past ten\n\nyears.\n\n\n\nWhile junking HS2 would be a large step towards paying for some more\n\n\"striver\"-friendly ideas (and ending all welfare for those earning more than\n\nÂ£100,000 would give him Â£5 billion more to play with), Ed Miliband still needs\n\nto come up with a welfare policy that will stop the Tories stealing the\n\nblue-collar vote. David Cameron's Â£26,000 cap on benefits is easily\n\nunderstandable and appealing to your average working family. Labour need a\n\nsimilarly big idea.\n\n\n\nFortunately there is a ready-made policy that has been implemented with great\n\nsuccess in the US, Australia and Canada, and that has drawn supportive noises on\n\nthe British left from people such as the MP Frank Field and the columnist Polly\n\nToynbee. Bill Clinton's workfare policy, which would require benefit claimants\n\nto undertake compulsory activity that they are physically able to do, would fit\n\nsquarely within the contributory principle that Ed Miliband has called for and\n\nshow that Labour are on the side of those who want to work.\n\n\n\nFinally, Labour need to produce a credible European policy. So far Ed Miliband\n\nhas, understandably, not wanted to commit his party to a potentially disruptive\n\nvote on the EU. But as Labour's poll lead narrows and with a new EU treaty in\n\nthe next few years now virtually inevitable, the danger of Labour looking out of\n\nsync with both British and European opinion is growing. Labour shouldn't stop\n\nwith a referendum promise, however. By setting out a wider ambition for European\n\nreform - not least by focusing on freezing Britain's contribution to the EU and\n\nreforming the Common Agricultural Policy - Mr Miliband can reinforce the sense\n\nthat he's on the side of the taxpayer and the consumer.\n\n\n\nWill Straw, of the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research, has set\n\nout a package of sensible, Labour-friendly ideas that would, for example, give\n\nthe British Parliament powers to block new EU legislation. In these three areas\n\n- government spending, welfare and the EU - Labour need simple, memorable\n\npolicies that will define them as the real voice of the squeezed middle. The\n\nelection battlefield is tilted in their favour, but having correctly identified\n\ntheir target audience they need policies to back it up. Scrapping unpopular\n\npolicies such as HS2 to fund help for the low-paid; introducing workfare; and\n\nending Labour's pro-EU reputation would give Ed Miliband the streetwise policies\n\nthat he lacks.\n\n\n\nMatthew Elliott is chief executive of Business for Britain\n\n\n\nEd Miliband needs a 3-point lead to win, Tories an 11-point one\n\n\n\n"

Only last month, the cost of HS2 was revised\n\nupwards from Â£30 billion to Â£42 billion, with some predicting that the figure\n\nwill rise above Â£70 billion. For this reason two big Labour beasts, Peter\n\nMandelson and Alistair Darling, have already switched sides and become\n\nopponents. The HS2 budget would be better invested in overcrowded and\n\nunelectrified commuter routes, and to reduce the cost of the daily commute for\n\npeople who have seen fares increase by more than 50 per cent in the past ten\n\nyears.\n\n\n\nWhile Junking HS2 would be a large step towards paying for some more\n\n\"striver\"-friendly ideas (and ending all welfare for those earning more than\n\nÂ£100,000 would give him Â£5 billion more to play with), Ed Miliband still needs\n\nto come up with a welfare policy that will stop the Tories stealing the\n\nblue-collar vote. David Cameron's Â£26,000 cap on benefits is easily\n\nunderstandable and appealing to your average working family. Labour need a\n\nsimilarly big idea.\n\n\n\nFortunately there is a ready-made policy that has been implemented with great\n\nsuccess in the US, Australia and Canada, and that has drawn supportive noises on\n\nthe British left from people such as the MP Frank Field and the columnist Polly\n\nToynbee. Bill Clinton's workfare policy, which would require benefit claimants\n\nto undertake compulsory activity that they are physically able to do, would fit\n\nsquarely within the contributory principle that Ed Miliband has called for and\n\nshow that Labour are on the side of those who want to work.\n\n\n\nFinally, Labour need to produce a credible European policy. So far Ed Miliband\n\nhas, understandably, not wanted to commit his party to a potentially disruptive\n\nvote on the EU. But as Labour's poll lead narrows and with a new EU treaty in\n\nthe next few years now virtually inevitable, the danger of Labour looking out of\n\nsync with both British and European opinion is growing. Labour shouldn't stop\n\nwith a referendum promise, however. By setting out a wider ambition for European\n\nreform - not least by focusing on freezing Britain's contribution to the EU and\n\nreforming the Common Agricultural Policy - Mr Miliband can reinforce the sense\n\nthat he's on the side of the taxpayer and the consumer.\n\n\n\nWill Straw, of the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research, has set\n\nout a package of sensible, Labour-friendly ideas that would, for example, give\n\nthe British Parliament powers to block new EU legislation. In these three areas\n\n- government spending, welfare and the EU - Labour need simple, memorable\n\npolicies that will define them as the real voice of the squeezed middle. The\n\nelection battlefield is tilted in their favour, but having correctly identified\n\ntheir target audience they need policies to back it up. Scrapping unpopular\n\npolicies such as HS2 to fund help for the low-paid; introducing workfare; and\n\nending Labour's pro-EU reputation would give Ed Miliband the streetwise policies\n\nthat he lacks.\n\n\n\nMatthew Elliott is chief executive of Business for Britain\n\n\n\nEd Miliband needs a 3-point lead to win, Tories an 11-point one\n\n\n\n"

Such a pledge would\n\nhonour the Conservative principle that individuals should be enabled to take\n\ncare of themselves, and the Labour principle that we should be fair to the\n\npoorest and neediest in our society.\n\n\n\nSIMON LOVEDAY\n\n\n\nWells, Somerset\n\n\n\nSir, If all of Tim Montgomerie's five policies were implemented, with the\n\npossible exception of the apprenticeships, they would have scarcely any impact\n\non the real challenges: healthcare, exports, manufacturing and debt reduction.\n\ndr david b. cook Sheffield, S Yorks Sir, Full marks to Tim Montgomerie for\n\nconfirming what the Conservative Party's pledge for an EU referendum is really\n\nabout, ie, to keep the party united. I had always hoped, rather naively perhaps,\n\nthat a party in government should govern in the best interests of the country.\n\nNobody knows whether most people actually want an EU referendum - where's the\n\nevidence confirming this? What we do know is that the Conservative Party is\n\nmightily worried about losing votes to UKIP and that's where the pledge for a\n\nreferendum has come from. So, never mind that inward investment to the UK is\n\npotentially damaged as long as the pledge for a referendum results in more votes\n\nfor the Conservatives.\n\n\n\nJAMES WATTS\n\n\n\nPurley, Surrey\n\n\n\nSir, How about a sixth pledge to show David Cameron's honesty and integrity:\n\nthat there will be no more top-down reorganisation of the NHS. Who then could\n\ndoubt his sincerity.\n\n\n\nW. B. HUGHES\n\n\n\nRugby, Warks\n\n\n\n"

His salary,\n\nthree times that of the average Palestinian worker, rescued his family from\n\ndestitution. Now he worries that international politics have put their future in\n\ndoubt.\n\n\n\nThe SodaStream factory, a mile from his home in the West Bank, sits inside a\n\nsprawling Jewish settlement, one of the targets of new European Union measures\n\naimed at putting pressure on Israel to stop building on seized Palestinian land.\n\nGuidelines issued last week prohibiting EU funds for Israeli entities in the\n\noccupied territories have been credited for pushing Binyamin Netanyahu, the\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister, towards fresh peace talks.\n\n\n\nNow Brussels is preparing to draft fresh proposals requiring that products\n\noriginating from the settlements be labelled as such.\n\n\n\nEU officials say this would help consumers to make more informed choices. At\n\npresent, goods from settlements in the occupied territories are labelled as\n\nthose from within Israel's internationally recognised borders. Brussels wants\n\nconsumers to know that such goods were produced in Israeli occupied territory.\n\n\n\nIsrael's Economics Minister, Naftali Bennett, denounced the moves as \"an\n\neconomic terror attack\".\n\n\n\nThe Palestinian Authority called for Brussels to go further, with a boycott on\n\nsettlement goods - like the sanctions that helped bring down apartheid in South\n\nAfrica. \"We would like to see the day that no goods from settlements are on sale\n\nanywhere in the world,\" the Palestinian deputy economic minister, Abd-AlHafeez,\n\nsaid. Such a day would mean disaster for SodaStream, which produces fizzy\n\ndrink-makers in an industrial park attached to the West Bank's biggest\n\nsettlement, Ma'ale Adumim.\n\n\n\nMore than 70 per cent of its $30 million (Â£20 million) annual earnings come from\n\nEurope.\n\n\n\nPro-Palestinian activists in Europe, Canada and the United States have urged\n\nconsumers to boycott Soda-Stream along with other settlementbased companies.\n\nLast October, a coalition of non-profit groups, including Christian Aid and the\n\nMethodist Church, issued a report accusing EU countries of helping to sustain\n\nillegal settlements by importing 15 times more goods made there than in\n\nPalestinian-run towns in the West Bank. In Eizarya, the Palestinian town that\n\nprovides half of SodaStream's workforce, feelings are sharply divided. The\n\ncommunity's economy went into freefall after Israel erected its vast concrete\n\n\"security barrier\" across the main commercial strip, starving local business of\n\nvital traffic from Jerusalem.\n\n\n\nThe carpentry workshop owned by Mr Abedy's family never recovered and they had\n\nno income until a friend of Faiz's told him about SodaStream's factory next to\n\nMa'ale Adumim.\n\n\n\nHis father, Omar, was horrified at the prospect of his son working for a company\n\nbased in the settlement whose expansion threatens not Just their town's survival\n\nbut also hopes of a Palestinian state. \"If there was any alternative, I would\n\nnever have allowed him to work there,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFaiz says his Job is the best he could hope to get but he has few illusions\n\nabout SodaStream's motives. Industries that locate in the West Bank benefit from\n\nsimilar economic incentives and generous tax breaks as individual settlers\n\nthemselves, so doing so makes financial sense.\n\n\n\nDaniel Birnbaum, SodaStream's CEO, said the company \"reJects the notion that our\n\nfacility is a barrier to peace in the Middle East\".\n\n\n\nA company statement said: \"We will not be party to condemning our employees and\n\ntheir families to unemployment and poverty, which the EU is effectively doing.\"\n\n\n\nHamas would accept any settlement reached by Palestinian negotiators with the\n\nIsraelis provided it was endorsed by a referendum of all the Palestinian people,\n\nJimmy Carter, the former US President said yesterday.\n\n\n\nThe Nobel peace laureate, 88, revealed in London that he had been talking\n\ndirectly with Hamas leaders for several years. Washington has refused all\n\ndiplomatic contact.\n\n\n\n\"My experience is that Hamas would accept any peace deal if it was put to a\n\nreferendum,\" he said. In both Israel and the Palestinian territories there was\n\ngreater support for a deal than among their \"big-shot bosses\".\n\n\n\nEast Jerusalem One mile Old City 1967 border JERUSALEM Eizariya WEST BANK Ma'ale\n\nAdumim Mishor Adumim Security barrier\n\n\n\n"

Opening it\n\nup would reveal the truth, which is that most lobbying is not successful This\n\nParliament has been dominated by political promises. The Deputy Prime Minister\n\nsuffered a blow from which he has yet to recover when he broke his promise not\n\nto increase tuition fees. It was very much harder to reach a conclusion to the\n\nspending review because, under pressure from Gordon Brown in a televised debate,\n\nDavid Cameron committed his party to protecting benefits for the elderly. The\n\nbackbenchers of the Conservative Party have spent much of their time in office\n\ndemanding, and finally getting, a promise from their Prime Minister to hold a\n\nreferendum on Britain's membership of the European Union.\n\n\n\nOne of the promises that the Prime Minister will redeem this week is the pledge\n\nto introduce a register of lobbyists. At the time of the furore over MPs'\n\nexpenses, Mr Cameron was moved to say that lobbying was the next big scandal\n\nwaiting to happen. In an era in which previously private transactions are\n\nfinding their way into the public realm, it is surely only a matter of time\n\nbefore the hidden process by which influence is wielded becomes a matter of\n\npublic record.\n\n\n\nWhether such a moment has arrived with the twin revelations that the Government\n\nis changing its position on tobacco packaging and that Lynton Crosby, the Prime\n\nMinister's adviser, runs a consultancy called CTF whose clients include the\n\ntobacco firm Philip Morris Ltd, is not clear. The Government insists that it is\n\nwaiting for evidence to arrive from Australia, which is the only country to have\n\nlegislated to make tobacco companies sell cigarettes in plain packaging. It is\n\nperfectly feasible that plain packaging might increase counterfeit cigarettes,\n\nwhich would increase high-tar smoking. However, it is important to clarify that\n\nthe decision had nothing to do with Mr Crosby's links to the industry.\n\n\n\nThis is especially important as it is known that Philip Morris Ltd did both\n\nsponsor a campaign by small shopkeepers objecting to the scheme and also lobby\n\nofficials from the Department of Health. There is nothing intrinsically wrong\n\nwith lobbying of this kind. Indeed, it is a critical component in a democracy\n\nthat interest groups of all kinds should have access to government and its\n\nrepresentatives, so that their case can be heard. Public administration would be\n\nthe poorer if those who were affected by the decisions made by ministers were\n\nunable to discuss them. The State still spends almost half of all national\n\nincome. The regulations that emanate from Whitehall have a significant bearing\n\non the health of British firms and, by extension, on the prosperity of the\n\nnation.\n\n\n\nIt also makes sense that an industry should have arisen to facilitate this\n\nconversation. Lobbyists watch, on behalf of their clients, for any threats that\n\nmight emerge from changes to the law in London and Brussels. The decision to\n\nhire a reputable lobbyist is no more a scandal than the decision to hire a\n\nlawyer or an accountant. The important point is that the relationships should be\n\nclear and the conversations transparent. The US Lobbying Disclosure Act does not\n\nprevent some distasteful lobbying but it does mean that all payments are\n\nconducted in broad daylight.\n\n\n\nTransparency about lobbying might, in fact, unearth a surprising truth. This\n\nindustry of 61,000 employees and a turnover of Â£7.5 billion is usually incapable\n\nof achieving the influence that its practitioners claim. There is very little\n\nevidence that British public policy is regularly changed in secret meetings\n\nbetween ministers and lobbyists.\n\n\n\nIt makes sense, therefore, as much to eradicate the impression of wrongdoing as\n\nthe reality, to make the process of lobbying more open and transparent. If a\n\nstatutory register of lobbyists helps to achieve that objective then it is to be\n\nwelcomed.\n\n\n\nMistrust about lobbying has now reached 10 Downing Street and the Prime Minister\n\nwould be wise to keep his promise.\n\n\n\n"

The backbenchers of the Conservative Party have spent much of their\n\ntime in office demanding, and finally getting, a promise from their Prime\n\nMinister to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union.\n\n\n\nOne of the promises that the Prime Minister will redeem this week is the pledge\n\nto introduce a register of lobbyists. At the time of the furore over MPs'\n\nexpenses, Mr Cameron was moved to say that lobbying was the next big scandal\n\nwaiting to happen. In an era in which previously private transactions are\n\nfinding their way into the public realm, it is surely only a matter of time\n\nbefore the hidden process by which influence is wielded becomes a matter of\n\npublic record.\n\n\n\nWhether such a moment has arrived with the twin revelations that the Government\n\nis changing its position on tobacco packaging and that Lynton Crosby, the Prime\n\nMinister's adviser, runs a consultancy called CTF whose clients include the\n\ntobacco firm Philip Morris Ltd, is not clear. The Government insists that it is\n\nwaiting for evidence to arrive from Australia, which is the only country to have\n\nlegislated to make tobacco companies sell cigarettes in plain packaging. It is\n\nperfectly feasible that plain packaging might increase counterfeit cigarettes,\n\nwhich would increase high-tar smoking. However, it is important to clarify that\n\nthe decision had nothing to do with Mr Crosby's links to the industry.\n\n\n\nThis is especially important as it is known that Philip Morris Ltd did both\n\nsponsor a campaign by small shopkeepers obJecting to the scheme and also lobby\n\nofficials from the Department of Health. There is nothing intrinsically wrong\n\nwith lobbying of this kind. Indeed, it is a critical component in a democracy\n\nthat interest groups of all kinds should have access to government and its\n\nrepresentatives, so that their case can be heard. Public administration would be\n\nthe poorer if those who were affected by the decisions made by ministers were\n\nunable to discuss them. The State still spends almost half of all national\n\nincome. The regulations that emanate from Whitehall have a significant bearing\n\non the health of British firms and, by extension, on the prosperity of the\n\nnation.\n\n\n\nIt also makes sense that an industry should have arisen to facilitate this\n\nconversation. Lobbyists watch, on behalf of their clients, for any threats that\n\nmight emerge from changes to the law in London and Brussels. The decision to\n\nhire a reputable lobbyist is no more a scandal than the decision to hire a\n\nlawyer or an accountant. The important point is that the relationships should be\n\nclear and the conversations transparent. The US Lobbying Disclosure Act does not\n\nprevent some distasteful lobbying but it does mean that all payments are\n\nconducted in broad daylight.\n\n\n\nTransparency about lobbying might, in fact, unearth a surprising truth. This\n\nindustry of 61,000 employees and a turnover of Â£7.5 billion is usually incapable\n\nof achieving the influence that its practitioners claim. There is very little\n\nevidence that British public policy is regularly changed in secret meetings\n\nbetween ministers and lobbyists.\n\n\n\nIt makes sense, therefore, as much to eradicate the impression of wrongdoing as\n\nthe reality, to make the process of lobbying more open and transparent. If a\n\nstatutory register of lobbyists helps to achieve that obJective then it is to be\n\nwelcomed. Mistrust about lobbying has now reached 10 Downing Street and the\n\nPrime Minister would be wise to keep his promise.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was Hitler's demands that revived the Spanish claim. The German dictator told\n\nGeneral Franco to give the German army free passage across the country so that\n\nit could launch a massive land assault on Gibraltar, the impregnable fortress\n\nfrom which Britain denied the Nazis entrance to the Mediterranean.\n\n\n\nFranco demurred. He did not want to ally Spain, exhausted from civil war, with\n\nthe Axis without the reward of Morocco as a Spanish colony. But he realised then\n\nthe extraordinary military value of Gibraltar, denied to Spain since the Treaty\n\nof Utrecht in 1713. After the war, he stepped up his campaign to force Britain\n\nto return the Rock.\n\n\n\nIt is a dispute that has been going on for the past half century, complicating\n\nBritain's otherwise good relations with Madrid, vexing Nato, posing problems for\n\nthe European Union and leading to dozens of diplomatic incidents and proposals\n\nto change the status of Gibraltar, now officially a self-governing British\n\noverseas territory.\n\n\n\nIn the Cold War, the territory was again of vital strategic value - guarding the\n\n9-mile Strait of Gibraltar in case the Soviet Union attempted to pour ships and\n\ntroops into the Mediterranean.\n\n\n\nIn 1727 and 1779, Spain had attempted unsuccessfully to force Britain out by\n\nsiege. In 1954, Franco called for Gibraltar to be returned to Spain as a reward\n\nfor its neutrality during the war, and in the 1960s he took the issue to the\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly, which passed two resolutions as part of its\n\npolicy to end colonialism across the world. The wording of each, significantly,\n\nfocused on the \"interests\" of the Gibraltarians rather than on their \"wishes\".\n\nSpain made a formal proposal in 1966 to cancel the Treaty of Utrecht and assume\n\nsovereignty. Britain rejected it and a year later a referendum in Gibraltar\n\nshowed overwhelming rejection - by 99.1 per cent - of any change. Many\n\nGibraltarians are descended from settlers from overseas. Two years later, Spain\n\nclosed the land frontier, which remained shut until 1984.\n\n\n\nGibraltar resolved not to depend on Spain; goods as well as workers came from\n\nBritain and North Africa. But Gibraltar's demand for either independence or full\n\nintegration within Britain was rebuffed.\n\n\n\nIn 1985, Madrid proposed joint sovereignty, while promising to keep Gibraltar's\n\nway of life and with a leaseback arrangement to Britain for up to 20 years.\n\n\n\nThe idea was turned down, but in 1997 Spain renewed the idea with a proposed\n\nleaseback for as long as 100 years. This was provisionally agreed by Britain in\n\n2002, and the Labour government committed itself to talks on implementation.\n\n\n\nGibraltarians remained firmly opposed, however, insisting that they must also be\n\nrepresented at talks, and began a campaign for Crown dependency status:\n\nindependence in all but name. Spain ruled both out. In 2002, a second Gibraltar\n\nreferendum again led to rejection of Spanish sovereignty by 99 per cent.\n\n\n\nSpain's tactics have varied since then, at times imposing new restrictions, at\n\nothers offering a more emollient approach. The dispute has repeatedly got in the\n\nway of bilateral relations. Spain's king snubbed the wedding of Prince Charles\n\nand Princess Diana because they were to visit the Rock on honeymoon; Queen\n\nSophia declined an invitation to Buckingham Palace to celebrate the Queen's\n\ndiamond jubilee in 2012. Britain has also had to use considerable pressure to\n\nstop Gibraltar setting itself up as a tax haven or to benefit from local\n\nsmuggling.\n\n\n\nThe latest incident over fishing is one of many that has flared up in Gibraltar\n\nwaters over the years due to rows over who controls the sea around the Rock.\n\n\n\nQuietly and gradually, however, Spain has relaxed some restrictions in an\n\nattempt to show Gibraltar a more friendly face. But for the moment there is\n\nlittle immediate prospect of any change.\n\n\n\n"

No one could ever remember such a\n\nthing happening before but, as one of Mr Wharton's friends said to me: \"Any\n\nexcuse!\" I was rather shocked to see that Mr Wharton, above, was serving a\n\nFrench Merlot and a Portuguese white. But, I protested, Portugal is one of the\n\nheavily indebted Piigs countries! \"Don't read anything into the wine,\" Mr\n\nWharton insisted. Sheryll Murray, another Tory MP, had cranked up her badge\n\nmachine and was handing out two offerings: one said \"EU Referendum - Back the\n\nBill\" and another attacked the Lib Dems. I think we know which one sold out.\n\n\n\nROCKET FUEL\n\n\n\nThen it was on to another soirÃ©e, this one given by the all-party Parliamentary\n\nSpace Committee, which is chaired by Adam Afriyie, the visionary Tory MP and\n\nmuch-touted future prime minister. I have made a pledge to track Adam's career\n\nprogress and so off I went to Join about a hundred spacehoppers orbiting\n\nStrangers' Dining Room.\n\n\n\n\"Pop!\" went the champagne. I have to report that the space cadets are certainly\n\nintent on putting the party into all-party groups. I escaped only after being\n\nheld captive by a proponent of satellite technology. \"It's not rocket science,\"\n\nhe told me, before adding: \"Well, actually it is.\"\n\n\n\nPARTY ANIMAL DAVE\n\n\n\nDave's such a party animal that I'm amazed he finds time to govern the country.\n\nHe ended the week slaving over a hot barbecue at No 10, flipping burgers (and\n\nnot policies for a change). The idea was to get to know his backbenchers better,\n\nwhich wouldn't be hard. It certainly contrasts from how he began the week, which\n\nwas in Kazakhstan, munching caviar and sipping one or two glasses of Chivas\n\nRegal with the super-democrat President Nazarbayev. The two chillaxed in the\n\n\"Irish Bar\" at the Rixos hotel in Astana, where a pint of Guinness costs Â£11. No\n\ndoubt Mr Nazarbayev, who got 95 per cent of the vote, had some election advice\n\nfor Dave. It helps, of course, to have all of your challengers end up endorsing\n\nyou. Somehow I'm not sure Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband will follow suit.\n\n\n\nTHE WRATH OF BERCOW\n\n\n\nJohn Bercow, the Speaker, adores tennis and may be cross that he has not been\n\nspending more time at Wimbledon. Certainly he has been in a foul mood of late.\n\nLast week Mr Bercow savaged Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, for \"totally\n\nmishandling\" a statement. (The actual words were \"woefully inadequate and\n\nfrankly utterly incompetent\".) A day later he let rip at Simon Burns, the\n\nTransport Minister. \"You are a slow learner. You are a late developer but you've\n\ngot to try and grasp the point.\" But then Mr Burns did once call the Speaker a\n\n\"sanctimonious dwarf\". Is it time for Mr Bercow to do a little chillaxing?\n\nCentre court, anyone?\n\n\n\n"

In introducing the Bill, I\n\nspeak for many in the House, but I speak for millions more outside.\"\n\n\n\nSir David nudged me as Nadhim Zahawi rolled to his feet. Mr Zahawi is so loyal\n\nthat once he almost won my coveted Lickspittle of the Year competition.\n\n\n\n\"Often, with Tory Unitedous, the limelight is irresistible,\" whispered Sir\n\nDavid.\n\n\n\nLusty cheers resounded for Mr Zahawi, who looked almost entirely happy. He asked\n\nYoung James: \"Have you received representations from the leader of the Labour\n\nParty, Len McCluskey, on what he thinks the position should be on this important\n\nissue?\" Oh my! How Tory Unitedous shrieked with laughter! For, of course, Len is\n\nnot leader of the Labour Party but of its financial backer, the Unite union.\n\nJames said that he hadn't heard from Len or, indeed, Ed Miliband, and returned\n\nto his theme, noting that the last referendum on Europe was in 1975. This, by\n\nthe way, was before Young James was born: \"How things have changed: politics has\n\nmoved on, and the EU has moved on.\"\n\n\n\nA new roar filled the room as Dennis Skinner, the Labour dinosaur, stood up. Sir\n\nDavid looked almost in awe as he peered down at the legendary Beast of Bolsover.\n\n\n\n\"I voted for a referendum in 1975,\" rasped the Beast. \"Sadly, the country did\n\nnot follow my advice, or we would not be doing what we are doing today. However,\n\nthe Bill is deficient in one respect: it does not ask for a referendum until\n\n2017. What we need is a referendum before the next election!\"\n\n\n\nYoung James rocked back and forth. \"I wish more people had listened to you in\n\n1975,\" he said, to immense Tory merriment.\n\n\n\nThe vote, in the end, was 304 to zero. As we watched the MPs voting, still\n\namazed, Sir David whispered to me: \"This was the day that Tory Unitedous\n\nroared.\" We may not see it again.\n\n\n\n"

The brutal reality of 'European Union' is\n\nmanifesting itself in the Mediterranean where EU economic policies have wrecked\n\nlives and now fan the flames of aggressive extremism.\"\n\n\n\nThe letter has been signed by 22 figures, including Professor David Abulafia, of\n\nthe University of Cambridge, Professor Jeremy Black, of the University of\n\nExeter, and Andrew Roberts, the TV historian. Signatories on the left include Dr\n\nHan-Rog Kang and Dr Abigail Green, both of the University of Oxford.\n\n\n\nThe historians explicitly deny that they are acting \"out of national or racial\n\nprejudice\" and make clear that leaving Europe must be a serious consideration.\n\n\n\nThe letter has been co-ordinated by Business for Britain, the campaign group\n\npushing for subtantial changes to Britain's relationship with Europe. It comes\n\nthree days before a symbolic Bill enshrining an EU referendum in law will be put\n\nto a vote in the Commons.\n\n\n\nEd Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, appeared to shut down any chance of Labour\n\nendorsing a referendum on the EU before the summer recess. He told The Times CEO\n\nSummit: \"I don't think the biggest priority for Britain right now is a political\n\nrow.\"\n\n\n\nHe said that Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and David Cameron were united in the need\n\nfor reform of Europe and to prevent a \"drift to the exit\". He added: \"The thing\n\nI would like to see is to get to genuinely cross-party consensus about the\n\nimportance of Britain being a strong player outside the single currency.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, Labour was ridiculed in the Commons yesterday over suggestions that it\n\nwould abstain in Friday's vote. The Tory MP Sir Tony Baldry warned the House:\n\n\"This is not an issue which Parliament and Members of Parliament can run away\n\nfrom.\"\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron said Labour's response made them look \"feeble\". Addressing Mr\n\nMiliband, he said: \"When it comes to this Bill on Friday ... surely you must\n\nhave an opinion?\" Letters, page 21\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can't quite see mainland Europe from the top of the Gherkin, but on Monday\n\nevening the view was so clear that it felt as if France must be just beyond the\n\ndistant haze where hills met the sky. Europe did, however, loom metaphorically\n\nlarge on the horizon for delegates who gathered at the top of the landmark\n\nLondon building for the opening of The Times CEO Summit.\n\n\n\nOver dinner on the 40th floor of 30 St Mary Axe (to give the building its\n\nofficial name) the debate was In or Out? Britain in the EU.\n\n\n\nThe location was apposite. The Gherkin has become a symbol of a financial centre\n\nthat drives a national economy, but it is regarded by some in Europe as needing\n\na shorter leash. Standing on the former site of the Baltic Exchange, this\n\ntumescent tribute to financial pre-eminence was designed by British architects,\n\nbuilt by a Swedish construction company and is jointly owned by German and UK\n\ncompanies, with a Swiss reinsurer as a big tenant.\n\n\n\nThe menu was British with a continental flavour: Cornish mackerel, Hereford beef\n\nand Eton mess, served with French and Spanish wine.\n\n\n\nPrevious summits have looked at deficit reduction, boosting the economy and\n\nturning British companies into world leaders. This year it was clear that Europe\n\nis the red-meat issue engaging politicians and business leaders.\n\n\n\n\"It's an unusual business issue in that there is a genuine spectrum of views,\"\n\nJohn Cridland, Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry, said.\n\n\"I will not claim there is a consensus, because there isn't. I have people that\n\nbelieve we would be better out than in, and I have people who believe we have to\n\nbe in, so don't waste too much time on debate on reform.\"\n\n\n\nHe estimated that 80 per cent of his members were in favour of being in Europe,\n\nbut \"the challenge is that Europe is moving at a pace, and I don't find many CBI\n\nmembers who have an appetite to be part of that ever closer union of the\n\neurozone core. But they are interested in us being a full shareholder in a wider\n\nEurope.\"\n\n\n\nThe theme of the evening quickly emerged: reform. All four panellists hoped to\n\nsee Britain successfully negotiate with Europe to secure a better deal in\n\nEurope. John Mills, the chairman of the consumer products company JML, the\n\nco-chairman of Business for Britain and a leading Labour donor, said he wanted\n\nto see a renegotiation of Britain's EU membership before letting voters have\n\ntheir say in a referendum. \"I think we should try, but I have to say I am not\n\nvery optimistic that we are going to get the changes that most people in this\n\ncountry would like to see.\"\n\n\n\nRoland Rudd, the chairman of the communications group RLM Finsbury and the\n\nchairman of Business for New Europe, said Britain was not alone. Other countries\n\nalso wanted reform of the European Union and its powers. The French might say\n\n\"not over our dead body\", but \"the odd man in Europe is France. It is not\n\nBritain\". He said, however, attempts to negotiate a return of some powers to\n\nmember states would not be backed by other countries if they thought impossible\n\ndemands were being made to engineer an exit. \"No one is going to support us if\n\nthey think we are going to leave. You have to get the balance right and be\n\nserious about the reform agenda.\"\n\n\n\nWillie Walsh said he had witnessed several referenda in his native Ireland and\n\nwas concerned that people voted without understanding the facts. The chief\n\nexecutive of International Airlines Group said he had been dismayed by some of\n\nhis dealings with the European Commission. \"They shock me. I don't rate these\n\npeople.\" But he said he was pro-Europe. \"I don't think Britain has really played\n\na role in trying to shape Europe. We could play a more influential role in\n\nshaping the structure and direction of Europe.\"\n\n\n\nWalsh highlighted a great unknown at the heart of the European debate. People\n\nmight agree the EU needed to be reformed, but what if, after all the\n\nnegotiations, things had not changed? \"Would you leave if it wasn't any better?\n\nThat's a difficult question.\"\n\n\n\nA member of the audience asked what the panellists would want returned from\n\nBrussels. Walsh said Britain needed more control over labour legislation. Rudd\n\nsaid regional funding policy should be controlled by individual member\n\ncountries.\n\n\n\nMills said there was a \"whole range\" of powers that should be brought back, but\n\nthat \"the most crucial negotiations are going to be about what sort of role\n\n[Britain] is going to have in the EU if the eurozone becomes much closer. The\n\ncrucial negotiations aren't going to be about repatriation of the 48-hour\n\nworking week, they are going to be broader issues of exactly how a country like\n\nBritain is going to be outside the eurozone.\"\n\n\n\nJohn Cridland recalled how, as a teenager, he had got excited about tectonic\n\nplate theory. \"Whether we have earthquakes or volcanoes depends on tectonic\n\nplates moving. Europe seems to me now to have two tectonic plates: those in the\n\neurozone; and those who want to be enthusiastic full participating members of a\n\nwider union and with no intention of joining the euro. I think many of the\n\ndefining issues of the new Europe are how those two tectonic plates are going to\n\nget on with each other.\"\n\n\n\nHe didn't mention that troublesome third plate: those who don't want to be in\n\nEurope at all. As the sun set beyond the rim of the London basin, it was easy to\n\nimagine that plate resulting in a disturbance that would cause untold excitement\n\namong seismologists.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nLabour's biggest private donor has urged the party not to interfere in a Tory\n\nattempt to enshrine an EU referendum in law. John Mills, who gave Labour Â£1.65\n\nmillion in shares in January, said that offering voters a referendum in its next\n\nelection manifesto could make the difference in securing a majority for Ed\n\nMiliband in 2015.\n\n\n\nHe warned that any Labour attempt to hijack a Bill enshrining an EU referendum\n\nin law risked making the party look as if it was out to stop a referendum from\n\nhappening.\n\n\n\nThe Bill, promoted by Tory backbencher James Wharton and offering an in/out EU\n\nreferendum in 2017, is set to be put to its first vote on Friday. While Labour\n\nMPs will abstain, there is now talk among some senior party figures of\n\noutflanking David Cameron by amending the Bill to bring forward the referendum\n\ndate.\n\n\n\nThe party will have plenty of time to debate the idea over the summer, as\n\namendments to the Bill can be made when Parliament returns from its summer\n\nrecess in September.\n\n\n\nMr Mills, who appeared at The Times CEO Summit last night and is in favour of a\n\nreferendum, warned the party against such a move. \"One of the problems is an\n\namendment of that sort would be in danger of being something that would upset\n\nthe apple cart,\" he said. \"An uncertainty in all of this is what people's\n\nintentions are - whether they are really supporting [a referendum], or whether\n\nthey are really out there to derail it. This is a really major constitutional\n\nmatter. I don't think it helps to get it caught up with party political\n\npositioning and this sort of thing.\" He said that measures needed to solve the\n\neurozone's debt crisis could yet \"trigger off\" Britain's so-called \"referendum\n\nlock\". The lock, created by the coalition Government, means that a referendum\n\nhas to take place before any further powers are transferred from Westminster to\n\nBrussels.\n\n\n\n\"We need to have a referendum at some stage over the next four years,\" he said.\n\n\"We are fairly opportunistic about when it actually takes place. The main thing\n\nis to make sure it actually happens.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, and Jon Cruddas, who is drawing\n\nup Labour's next manifesto, were sympathetic to the idea of holding a referendum\n\n. \"I suspect that [Labour] is moving to supporting a referendum,\" he said. \"But\n\nI don't think in the end that the Labour Party is going to have much choice.\"\n\n\n\nThere are discussions taking place within the Shadow Cabinet about how Labour\n\nshould approach an EU referendum.\n\n\n\nSenior figures are discussing the possibility of edging towards backing a\n\nreferendum in the party's next election manifesto.\n\n\n\nOne Labour source said that Lord Wood, one of Mr Miliband's most senior\n\nadvisers, had \"let the cat out of the bag\" in an interview last week in which he\n\nsuggested it was \"conceivable\" that Labour would back a referendum in its next\n\nmanifesto.\n\n\n\nMr Miliband remains nervous about the idea of backing a referendum, believing\n\nthat it would not currently be in Britain's national interest.\n\n\n\nNick Clegg said yesterday that the Lib Dems would be abstaining in Friday's\n\nvote. He said that his MPs would not \"waste any of our time helping the\n\nConservatives indulge in their own internal feuds\".

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to the Europe debate, British businesses don't want a straight\n\nin-out referendum. In fact, there is a strong voice building for an alternative\n\nvision. When we put the question to members of the British Chambers of Commerce,\n\n64 per cent said that renegotiation, rather than further integration or outright\n\nwithdrawal, is most likely to have the biggest economic benefit to the UK - as\n\nlong as this means that certain European Union powers are transferred back from\n\nBrussels to Westminster.\n\n\n\nBusinesses want access to the European trading bloc, but not at any cost. So\n\nDavid Cameron, the Prime Minister, has a strong mandate from business to try to\n\nrebalance Britain's relationship with the European Union. First, he must\n\nreassure himself that Britain has a strong hand in any negotiation. The 17\n\nmembers of the eurozone cannot meet their need for greater fiscal and political\n\nintegration without the acquiescence of all 27 member states. EU countries also\n\ndepend on trade with Britain, not just the other way round. It is not in\n\nEurope's interest to see the UK go.\n\n\n\nPro-European politicians who call for us to acquiesce to the current regime are\n\nplaying right into the hands of those who want us to withdraw immediately. Both\n\nsides are in danger of crowding out the possibility of a negotiated settlement,\n\nand neither is acting in the best economic interest of this country.\n\n\n\nBritain would lose with an \"in\" vote because it would be staying \"in\" a European\n\nUnion that is moving towards the sort of federal union that British businesses\n\nand voters say they do not want. Some 85 per cent of our member companies have\n\nsaid no to further integration, and I am sure that a similar percentage of the\n\nBritish public would say the same. Let us be clear: voting \"in\" would not let\n\nBritons choose the status quo. Although many europhile politicians and 26 per\n\ncent of our business people favour the status quo, preserving today's EU as it\n\nstands is impossible. Europe is changing, and rapidly. The eurozone, if it is to\n\nsurvive, requires a level of both fiscal and political integration that most\n\nBritons would not countenance.\n\n\n\nBritain also loses with an \"out\" vote. Although our trade with the rest of the\n\nworld is growing, pulling up the drawbridge is not a win for the UK economy.\n\nOnly 12 per cent of our businesses favour this option, because it would mean\n\nlosing the four freedoms of goods, capital, services and people. Although far\n\nfrom perfect, these give British businesses access to one of the biggest unified\n\nmarkets in the world.\n\n\n\nThere is no question that a changed relationship between Britain and the\n\nEuropean Union would need to be put to a referendum, as any proposed change\n\nwould be a major alteration to our constitutional settlement. The real choice\n\nthat the British public should be given is between a renegotiated relationship\n\nand leaving the European Union altogether. That means giving the Prime Minister\n\nthe support, space and time required to negotiate a better deal for Britain. Of\n\ncourse, it needs to be a proper deal.\n\n\n\nNo one believes this will be easy. The timeframe currently proposed - the\n\nreferendum on Britain's membership of the European Union is \"by the end of 2017\"\n\n- is too long. There is outright hostility to Britain's position from some\n\nquarters. And for a renegotiation to succeed, the European institutions must\n\nbelieve that our leaders are strong, serious and - if needed - ready to walk\n\naway.\n\n\n\nYet we may be approaching a moment in time where success is possible.\n\nDevelopments in the eurozone and change at the top of the European Commission in\n\n2014 may provide that chance.\n\n\n\nTo win the right deal for Britain, the Prime Minister must seize the mantle of\n\npragmatism. Europe is fast becoming the issue that will define Mr Cameron's\n\npremiership. To get it right, he must listen to all businesses, not just the\n\nfamiliar names, as well as the general tenor of public opinion. Crucially, the\n\nother side must be made to understand that he is prepared to stand up and leave\n\nthe negotiating table altogether if he is to be taken seriously - and if he is\n\nto secure a deal.\n\n\n\nJohn Longworth is Director-General of the British Chambers of Commerce\n\n\n\n60% of British companies believe that withdrawal from the EU would be bad for\n\nbusiness 33% say withdrawal followed by a trade agreement could be good 64%\n\nbelieve that staying in the EU with powers transferred from Brussels to\n\nWestminster would be good 23% are in favour of remaining and further integration\n\nwith member states 42% say retaining the status quo would be bad for business\n\nSource: BCC survey of 4,400 businesses\n\n\n\n"

The Government has maintained investment in\n\nworld-class universities, science and apprenticeships even in a difficult time\n\nfor public spending. And there is, within the industrial strategy, a framework\n\nfor long-term partnership between business and government.\n\n\n\nBut we need to counter doubts as to whether Britain really is open for business.\n\nThere are repeated complaints from the business world that visa administration\n\nis discouraging visitors from the emerging market economies and obstructing\n\nbusinesses in the UK who need senior and specialist staff from overseas.\n\n\n\nWhen big-spending Chinese visitors go to Germany rather than come here to the UK\n\nand talented Brazilian students switch from the UK to the USA then there is a\n\nchallenge we have to address.\n\n\n\nThat problem can be fixed with firm political leadership. What can less easily\n\nbe fixed is the growing, gnawing doubt among Asian and American investors about\n\nBritain's future role in the European Union.\n\n\n\nMany of them - from banks to car companies - are based in the UK because they\n\nsee us as a gateway to the Vince Cable wants Britain to be at the heart of\n\nEurope influencing policy, like Germany does EU Single Market, the biggest\n\nconcentration of purchasing power in the world, by far.\n\n\n\nSeen from the outside, Britain has an ideal position in relation to the EU. It\n\nis as a fully integrated member, able to determine how the Single Market should\n\nbe adapted to incorporate digital trade, for example.\n\n\n\nAt the same time Britain takes the lead role in pressing for an outward looking\n\ntrade policy, as with the launch of the EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment\n\nPartnership negotiations. We are winning the argument in Europe for a\n\nderegulatory business culture. However, the UK is not directly involved in the\n\nEurozone convulsions and has the advantage of a flexible exchange rate in\n\nhelping the country adjust to the painful consequences of the banking crisis and\n\nrecession.\n\n\n\nThe companies I meet, who all regard the UK as an excellent place to do\n\nbusiness, are mystified as to why all of this should be thrown into doubt by\n\nthose seeking an exit from the EU, and they worry about the uncertainty now\n\nbeing generated in the years running up to any referendum.\n\n\n\nThose who seek exit appear to believe in a comfort zone of semi-detached\n\nmembership of the Single Market as enjoyed by Norway or Switzerland. But these\n\ncountries have no say in formulating the rules and regulations to which they\n\nmust submit. If we went that way, the rules would stay, the influence would\n\ndiminish, and the investors leave.\n\n\n\nOthers argue that Britain has a viable future outside the European economic\n\norbit altogether, implying that this makes it easier to trade with Asia and\n\nother rapidly growing parts of the world. But Germany, in particular, is proving\n\nrather better at doing just that while firmly anchored in Europe; indeed at the\n\nheart of it.\n\n\n\nNor is there any sign that important trading and investment partners would be\n\ninterested in cutting special deals with the UK rather than a much bigger\n\nEuropean Union. Again, this position is deluded.\n\n\n\nThe debate around a British exit is a massive diversion of political energy when\n\nthe country needs single-minded concentration on repairing the economic damage\n\nafter the financial crash and on maintaining competitiveness. It is to be hoped\n\nthat serious members of the political class will provide the confidence and\n\ncontinuity that inward investors need.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Miliband risks being out of touch with Labour voters and losing the election\n\nbecause of Europe, the party's biggest private donor said last night.\n\n\n\nJohn Mills told the Times CEO Summit that voters would be more willing to\n\nsupport the party if they thought it offered a choice on Europe.\n\n\n\nMr Mills, the veteran businessman who chairs JML, the shopping channel, and gave\n\nthe party Â£1.65 million in shares in January, is pushing the party to put a\n\nreferendum on Britain's membership in the next election.\n\n\n\n\"The Parliamentary Labour Party is pretty Europhile and the party is too,\" Mr\n\nMills said. \"But the problem for the Labour Party is that the potential Labour\n\nvoter is more Eurosceptic than the Labour Party itself. That's a difficult\n\ndilemma that the leadership is going to have to wrestle with over the next few\n\nmonths.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether Mr Miliband would back a referendum despite his doubts that it is\n\nin the national interest, Mr Mills said: \"I think it's very difficult to tell.\n\nMy personal view that the Labour party is more likely to win if it's more open\n\nto this.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that Mr Miliband had been right to avoid Tory attempts to set a\n\nreferendum deadline in law. A Private Member's Bill to that effect, by\n\nbackbencher James Wharton, is due for debate on Friday and has the backing of\n\nthe Tory leadership.\n\n\n\nWhile Labour MPs will abstain, there is now talk among some senior party figures\n\nof outflanking David Cameron by amending the Bill to bring forward the\n\nreferendum date. The party has time to debate the idea, as amendments can be\n\ntabled after the parliamentary summer recess.\n\n\n\nMr Mills said it was uncertain whether the intention was to back a referendum or\n\ntry to derail it. He added: \"This is a really MAJOR constitutional matter. I\n\ndon't think it helps to get it caught up with party political positioning and\n\nthis sort of thing.\"\n\n\n\nHe said he did not think a renegotiation of Britain's EU membership would make\n\nmuch difference, hinting that in a referendum he would vote for Britain to leave\n\n- almost certainly putting him at odds with the party he supports.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the day, he said that Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, and Jon\n\nCruddas, who is drawing up Labour's next manifesto, were sympathetic to the idea\n\nof holding a referendum. He said he suspected that the party was moving towards\n\nbacking a referendum, but in the end might have little choice.\n\n\n\nHe said that solutions to the euro crisis could yet \"trigger off\" Britain's\n\nsocalled \"referendum lock\". The lock, created by the coalition Government,\n\nrequires a referendum before more powers are transferred from Westminster to\n\nBrussels.\n\n\n\n\"We need to have a referendum at some stage over the next four years,\" he said.\n\n\"We are fairly opportunistic about when it actually takes place. The main thing\n\nis to make sure it actually happens.\"\n\n\n\nYesterday, Nick Clegg said that the Lib Dems would abstain on Friday, adding\n\nthat his MPs would not \"waste any of our time helping the Conservatives indulge\n\nin their own internal feuds\". In a referendum, his party would campaign to stay\n\nin the EU, he said.\n\n\n\nHis aides said later that the Lib Dem manifesto would not back an in-out\n\nreferendum but would promise a referendum on any transfer of powers from\n\nWestminster.\n\n\n\nRachel Sylvester, page 21\n\n\n\n"

Most Labour and Liberal\n\nDemocrat MPs are expected not to attend the debate or vote.\n\n\n\nDanny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, expressed Lib Dem\n\nfrustration at the demands of Tory Eurosceptics as he poured scorn on Friday's\n\nvote and attacked Mr Cameron's strategy on Europe.\n\n\n\nBy trying to repatriate powers from Brussels, the Conservatives were \"wasting\"\n\nBritain's influence in Europe, he said, rather than using it to support the Job\n\ncreation and growth.\n\n\n\nIn a reference to the threat posed by Nigel Farage, he said: \"UKIP will come and\n\nUKIP will go, but what matters is that Britain stays a full member of the\n\nEuropean Union, that we have a referendum as and when a MAJOR treaty change\n\ntakes place, but we don't try and CONJURE one up out of nothing for domestic\n\npolitical reasons.\"\n\n\n\nVince Cable, the Business Secretary, is expected to say today that leaving the\n\nEU is \"neither a good nor a realistic economic option\" and support a focus on\n\nreforming Brussels from within.\n\n\n\n"

Supporting the effort to do so is the only way that\n\nDavid Cameron's most recent offer of a referendum can be believed.\n\n\n\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats are hoping to starve the legislation of time,\n\nkilling the Bill without ever fighting it openly. This is cowardice. If they are\n\nagainst the legislation they should be prepared to say so clearly and vote\n\nagainst it properly.\n\n\n\nIt is also foolish.

On the one hand,\n\nthere are those who see the EU as a vast, bureaucratic, expensive monstrosity,\n\nwhich has brought us few, if any, benefits, and deprived us of the capacity to\n\nmanage our affairs as we see fit. On the other, there are those who argue that\n\nthe EU has, for the first time in centuries, banished the prospect of war and\n\nspread prosperity; the recent eurozone crisis is, they say, only a temporary\n\nblip and, anyway, it is un-realistic to imagine that, in an increasingly\n\ninterdependent world, Britain could survive alone.\n\n\n\nThe eurozone crisis has brought the issue to a head. The pro-Europeans see it as\n\nan opportunity to press for greater political and economic integration while the\n\nantis see it as the moment to call a halt. In between the two camps lie the\n\ngreat mass of British people, increasingly sceptical, but bemused and not quite\n\ntrusting the propaganda from either side. Come the referendum, they could go\n\neither way.\n\n\n\nWhat is lacking thus far is any dispassionate analysis of how we got to where we\n\nare today and hard facts on which to base decisions about the future. Into that\n\ngap steps David Charter. His credentials are impeccable: now The Times\n\ncorrespondent in Berlin after five years in Brussels. \"This is not a campaigning\n\nbook,\" he writes. Rather it is \"an attempt to take stock of the perpetual\n\nevolution of the EU and its impact on Britain since we joined 40 years ago and,\n\ngiven our inexorable drift towards the exit, to see what it might mean to say au\n\nrevoir\".\n\n\n\nCharter has succeeded admirably. He has produced a well-researched,\n\nwell-documented and, above all, lucid and objective account of Britain's\n\nincreasingly fraught relationship with the EU. He describes how what began as a\n\npurely economic union gradually evolved into something much deeper and more\n\ncomplex, embracing not just free trade, but monetary, social, environmental and\n\neven justice and defence policy. In purely monetary terms Britain has paid in\n\nmuch more than it has got out, but other benefits - inward investment, a much\n\nlarger market for British goods and services, higher environmental standards,\n\ncheap air travel - are harder to quantify. Plus of course, what is arguably the\n\nEU's greatest achievement, the successful integration of the new democracies of\n\neastern Europe.\n\n\n\nIn the final chapters the author examines, issue by issue, the likely\n\nconsequences of withdrawal and sketches the alternatives. One possibility is a\n\ntwo-speed Europe consisting of an inner core of eurozone members whose economies\n\nare increasingly integrated and a second tier of members who seek the advantages\n\nof free trade without being signed up to every dot and comma of EU monetary,\n\nenvironmental and social policy.\n\n\n\nThe other possibility, complete withdrawal, presupposes that the UK could\n\nresuscitate its links with the Commonwealth as a source of cheap agricultural\n\nproduce and perhaps seek membership of the less prescriptive North American Free\n\nTrade Agreement.\n\n\n\nAs Charter makes clear, both alternatives amount to a giant leap into the\n\nunknown and we would still be dependent on the goodwill of our EU neighbours,\n\nwhich can no longer be taken for granted. Witness this quote from the Polish\n\nForeign Minister, Radoslaw Sikorski: \"Please don't expect us to help you wreck\n\nor paralyse the EU. Don't underestimate our determination not to return to the\n\npolitics of the 20th century. You were not occupied. Most of us on the Continent\n\nwere. We'll do almost anything to prevent it happening again.\"\n\n\n\nChris Mullin is a former Labour minister and the author of three volumes of\n\ndiaries, published by Profile\n\n\n\nAfter this leap into the unknown we would still depend on the goodwill of Europe\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nI've recently swapped running for swimming - my knees are going, and, unused, my\n\narms were starting to get string-like and disproportionate, like a T. rex.\n\n\n\nIn all, it's been a pleasant return to the pool. As a keen childhood swimmer, I\n\neasily slipped back into the customs of the place - thoughtfully removing the\n\nTribble-like lump of hair from the shower drains, in order to make showering\n\nmore agreeable for the next user, and eating a whole packet of crisps on the bus\n\non the way home, because I'm starving.\n\n\n\nIndeed, there has been only one floating verruca plaster in the otherwise serene\n\nwaters of my joy: \"medium\".\n\n\n\nMy local pool has three lanes. These are clearly, labelled thus: \"Slow\",\n\n\"Medium\" and \"Fast\". In the Slow lane, adult learner swimmers bob around on\n\nnoodles, laughing their heads off. In the Fast lane, meanwhile, three men in\n\ntiny trunks speed up and down, giving the impression that they are swimming to a\n\nvery important business meeting and must not be disturbed. And in the Medium\n\nlane - everyone else in Haringey, a million people, all packed together, in\n\nMedium soup.\n\n\n\nThe problem is this: only ten of those people should actually be in the Medium\n\nlane, tops. Believe me, I've swum behind all of them, and people, your\n\nbreaststroke is no Medium. There are people on the International Space Station\n\ndecanting cold treacle out of tins showing more hustle. You are a SLOW. Your\n\nspirit animal is the SLOWTH.\n\n\n\nThis is not a personal evaluation from me. I would merely draw your attention to\n\nthe sign at each end of the lane: \"MEDIUM: lengths in 28 seconds or less\".\n\n\n\nIt's there on the board: the official definition of \"Medium\". And yet, everyone\n\nswimming slowly in the Medium lane absolutely ignores it - because they \"feel\"\n\nMedium, inside, instead, and that's what really counts, to them. They just want\n\nto be Medium, despite all the facts.\n\n\n\nExactly the same thing happens on the motorway. Slow lane: empty, save the odd\n\nPolish artic. Fast lane: three men angrily swarming towards a meeting in\n\nDonington at 101mph. Middle lane: 50 million people in a terrifying, tailgating\n\nMedium soup, all the way from London to Birmingham, because they \"feel\"\n\nmiddle-lane-ish, despite all the facts.\n\n\n\nBecause, in this country, everyone wants to be a Medium. We all feel Medium. If\n\nI were to choose just one thing that defined \"Englishness\", it would be that. We\n\nwant to say that we are in the middle. Indeed, the English love Medium so much\n\nthat we put a moral value on it.\n\n\n\nBeing in the middle - neither excessive nor spare; neither too loud nor too\n\nquiet; too clever or too stupid; too flash or too dowdy - is the \"right\" thing\n\nto be. Think of all the things we trust the most: John Lewis, gently rolling\n\ncountryside, the middle classes, Radio 2. We love a happy medium. We feel most\n\ncomfortable when we're bang in the centre. Even if, really, we're not. Even if\n\nwe're eccentric or brilliant or broken or different or angry or pioneering or\n\nevil or half-asleep - we all like to think we're just like everyone else.\n\nWherever we are, that must be the centre. Whatever we are is normal and\n\nreasonable and right.\n\n\n\nAnd so, inevitably, to the bit where, in my swimming costume, reeking of\n\nchlorine, already thinking about the crisps, I realise I'm actually doing\n\nlengths in the middle of a massive societal metaphor.\n\n\n\nI'm looking at the pool - at all the stubborn people in the Medium lane,\n\nagonisingly slower than \"28 seconds per length\". Women who've come down with a\n\ncouple of friends, and are all swimming a slow breaststroke together, convinced\n\nthat they are Medium, even as faster swimmers pile up behind them, or stop\n\nentirely, in frustration.\n\n\n\nAnd I think, \"Oh my God - this is British politics! The Medium lane is the\n\n'middle ground'! The Libs and the Labs and the Cons all claiming they are right\n\nin the middle, they are the normal ones, they are average. Even with a\n\nreferendum on the EU, and privatising the NHS, and cutting welfare, and\n\nuniversity fees - they all still claim the middle ground. None of the three big\n\nparties would ever say they were being radical, or innovative, or different.\n\nNone of them will ever move out of the Medium lane, whatever speed or stroke\n\nthey're doing.\"\n\n\n\nAnd I watch the people who are naturally \"Medium\" - who really do swim a length\n\nin 28 seconds or less - getting frustrated with this bastardised Medium lane and\n\nducking under the lane separators. Some going left and harassing the \"Slow\"\n\nswimmers. Some going right and getting in the way of the \"Fast\" swimmers. And\n\nsome getting out of the pool completely.\n\n\n\nAnd I think about Nigel Farage, the riots two summers ago, and declining voter\n\nturnouts, and how dry this pool is making my hair.\n\n\n\nAnd I think: \"Medium\" does mean something. You can't just claim it if you want\n\nit. It means \"28 seconds per length\".\n\n\n\ncaitlin.moran@thetimes.co.uk\n\n\n\n"

Senior\n\nsources close to Mr Clegg said that the comment would have referred to the\n\nrecent behaviour of Tory backbenchers.\n\n\n\nSome senior Lib Dems fear that the Tories are trying to chisel them out of the\n\ncoalition and Mr Clegg's speech is in part an effort to pre-empt any further\n\nsuch talk. \"There's no conversation on our side about leaving,\" one senior MP\n\nsaid. \"The noises are coming from them.\"\n\n\n\nOne Lib Dem concern is that if the party left the coalition earlier Mr Cameron\n\nwould use the last six or eight months of the Parliament to publish populist\n\nmeasures on immigration and human rights laws that Mr Clegg would be powerless\n\nto temper.\n\n\n\nMr Clegg's aides said that today's speech was designed to help Mr Cameron to\n\nkeep the Government on track. Many Tories will see it as an attempt to\n\ncapitalise on their infighting and paint the Lib Dems as the united party.\n\n\n\nThe speech comes after The Times revealed last week that senior Tories were\n\nplanning for the early break-up of the coalition should Mr Clegg become unable\n\nto keep his party on side until 2015. No 10 aides have looked at several\n\nscenarios, including the Lib Dems quitting up to a year before polling day.\n\n\n\nMr Clegg's intervention also follows an interview with the Prime Minister,\n\npublished today, in which he appeared to contemplate an early end of the\n\ncoalition.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron told Total Politics magazine that while the best way to reform\n\nBritain was through the coalition, \"if that wasn't the case then we'd have to\n\nface the new circumstances in whatever way we should\".\n\n\n\nMr Clegg will warn the Tories that it is \"time to get back to governing\". He\n\nwill say that both he and Mr Cameron will come under pressure to break up the\n\ncoalition as the election approaches but that \"making compromises\" and \"doing\n\nthings you find uncomfortable\" were part of governing in the national interest.\n\n\n\n\"In 2010 the British people dealt us this hand,\" he will say. \"And they will not\n\nforgive either party if we call time ahead of the election that has been\n\nlegislated for in 2015 - destabilising the nation in the vague hope of\n\nshort-term political gain. I know some commentators think it would be clever to\n\nduck out six months early. But that doesn't make any sense either.

The\n\nnext, MPs disappearing into a parliamentary rabbit warren, obsessing over this\n\nnew tactic or that new trick. Anyone watching would be forgiven for asking,\n\n'What are these politicians doing?' \" Mr Clegg fuelled speculation about the\n\nlongevity of the coalition last week when he told Lib Dem peers that the Tories\n\nhad changed over the past three years. \"This isn't the Tory party I went into\n\ncoalition with,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSome of those present wondered whether Mr Clegg was beginning to rehearse his\n\narguments for the premature break-up of the governing partnership. Senior\n\nsources close to Mr Clegg said that the comment would have referred to the\n\nrecent behaviour of Tory backbenchers.\n\n\n\nSome senior Lib Dems fear that the Tories are trying to chisel them out of the\n\ncoalition and Mr Clegg's speech is in part an effort to pre-empt any further\n\nsuch talk. \"There's no conversation on our side about leaving,\" one senior MP\n\nsaid. \"The noises are coming from them.\"\n\n\n\nOne Lib Dem concern is that if the party left the coalition earlier Mr Cameron\n\nwould use the last six or eight months of the Parliament to publish populist\n\nmeasures on immigration and human rights laws that Mr Clegg would be powerless\n\nto temper.\n\n\n\nMr Clegg's aides said that today's speech was designed to help Mr Cameron to\n\nkeep the Government on track. Many Tories will see it as an attempt to\n\ncapitalise on their infighting and paint the Lib Dems as the united party.\n\n\n\nThe speech comes after The Times revealed last week that senior Tories were\n\nplanning for the early break-up of the coalition should Mr Clegg become unable\n\nto keep his party on side until 2015. No 10 aides have looked at several\n\nscenarios, including the Lib Dems quitting up to a year before polling day.\n\n\n\nMr Clegg's intervention also follows an interview with the Prime Minister,\n\npublished today, in which he appeared to contemplate an early end of the\n\ncoalition.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron told Total Politics magazine that while the best way to reform\n\nBritain was through the coalition, \"if that wasn't the case then we'd have to\n\nface the new circumstances in whatever way we should\".\n\n\n\nMr Clegg will warn the Tories that it is \"time to get back to governing\". He\n\nwill say that both he and Mr Cameron will come under pressure to break up the\n\ncoalition as the election approaches but that \"making compromises\" and \"doing\n\nthings you find uncomfortable\" were part of governing in the national interest.\n\n\n\n\"In 2010 the British people dealt us this hand,\" he will say. \"And they will not\n\nforgive either party if we call time ahead of the election that has been\n\nlegislated for in 2015 - destabilising the nation in the vague hope of\n\nshort-term political gain. I know some commentators think it would be clever to\n\nduck out six months early. But that doesn't make any sense either. The idea that\n\nthe Liberal Democrats could suddenly win back those people who have never liked\n\nus going into Government with the Conservatives is nonsense.\" Gay marriage vote,\n\nNews, page 16\n\n\n\n"

His spokesman said: \"The Prime Minister's position is\n\nthat he is a big believer in marriage - that's why he thinks gay people should\n\nbe able to get married too.\"\n\n\n\nVincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster and the leader of Roman Catholics\n\nin England and Wales, warned that the Government's reform \"poses grave risks to\n\nfreedom of speech and freedom of religion\".\n\n\n\nArchbishop Nichols will preach on the subject at the annual diocesan marriage\n\nMass in Westminster Cathedral today, which 600 married couples are expected to\n\nattend.\n\n\n\nMinisters sought to buy off a revolt on the issue this week with a review of the\n\nCivil Partnerships Act which would either abolish or extend the unions, but the\n\nidea was roundly dismissed by MPs on all sides of the House.\n\n\n\nSeparately, Mr Cameron came under pressure to allow joint Tory-UKIP candidates\n\nat the next election from a former deputy chairman of the party. Lord Dobbs told\n\nThe Times that Tories may need to seek the endorsement of Nigel Farage to\n\nprotect them from voters who doubted Mr Cameron's European strategy.\n\n\n\n\"In principle I could certainly see circumstances in which a joint candidacy\n\nwould be no bad thing,\" he said. \"I wouldn't rule it out. We changed the law to\n\nallow it.\"\n\n\n\nA handful of MPs from the Right, including Nadine Dorries, Peter Bone and Philip\n\nHollobone, want to explore the idea of securing a UKIP endorsement at the next\n\nelection. New rules allow candidates' names on ballot papers to be accompanied\n\nby two party logos.\n\n\n\nThe Tory high command tried to stamp on the idea, threatening to withhold\n\nnomination papers from anyone seeking a joint ticket. However, pressure from a\n\nsmall number of MPs is threatening to develop into a new cause of anger between\n\nthe Downing Street and the backbenches.\n\n\n\nLord Dobbs said that if by 2015 Mr Cameron's European strategy - of securing a\n\n\"new deal\" for Britain in Brussels based more on trade - was failing to bear\n\nfruit some Tory candidates may need the protection of a UKIP endorsement. He\n\nsaid: \"If we have made no progress on renegotiation by the time of the next\n\nelection, ignoring UKIP and what they stand for and what people out there are\n\nsaying about it would be extremely difficult.\"\n\n\n\nContinued from page 1 also [...]\n\n\n\n"

However, he stands accused of lacking seriousness about\n\ngovernment. The exit may coincide with a pick-up in the economy, leaving George\n\nOsborne to claim credit. Mr Cameron could appoint 20 new Tory ministers and\n\nimprove party morale.\n\n\n\nAn acrimonious split Mr Clegg is ousted after disastrous European elections next\n\nJune, the Lib Dems go into opposition, Vince Cable is elected leader at the\n\nparty conference. Effect Dr Cable puts distance between himself and Mr Cameron\n\nand starts flirting with Labour.\n\n\n\nLib Dem deserters start to return, hitting Labour's poll numbers and encouraging\n\nTories in marginals that they might cling on.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Eurovision, Westminster style. I had no idea when I went along to the\n\nPrivate Member's Bill ballot yesterday that it was going to be so much fun. For\n\nthis is not a ballot at all. It's more a raffle, with a bit of bingo thrown in\n\nand also darts, as in when they bellow \"One Hundred and Eighty!\" Our Master of\n\nCeremonies was Lindsay Hoyle, the Deputy Speaker whose sense of fun and\n\nLancashire accent are proving a huge hit these days. He had a glamorous\n\nassistant, of course. Tall, thin, dressed as a penguin with a white bow tie, his\n\nreal name was David Natzler and he was Clerk of Legislation but, of course, we\n\nstarted to call him Debbie.\n\n\n\n\"ORDER ORDER!\" shouted Mr Hoyle. Next to him Debbie opened a battered black\n\ndispatch box which looked like something from a boot fair except it had EiiR on\n\nit. Inside was a nest of bits of paper, just the right size to be Chinese\n\ntakeaway fortunes except, instead, they all had numbers.\n\n\n\nThe Eurovision set was extremely grand, as befits a ceremony of such\n\nconstitutional importance to our nation. Committee Room 10 overlooks the Thames\n\nwith red wallpaper of such deep flock that I expected to hear it go \"baaaa\" at\n\nany minute. At one end was a huge painting entitled Alfred Inciting the Saxons\n\nto Prevent the Landing of the Danes. Even the art was Eurosceptic.\n\n\n\nThe \"audience\" was made up mostly of Tory MPs desperate to have their number\n\npicked so they could introduce an EU Referendum Bill. But the snag was that it\n\nwasn't good enough to just be picked. There would be 20 numbers picked but only\n\nthe top few had a hope in hell (technical term) of securing a debate.\n\n\n\nLindsay boomed: \"Number 20!\" Debbie, after rummaging, almost tremulous, trilled:\n\n\"214!\" Lindsay consulted the oracle that was his list. \"Dr Matthew Offord!\" he\n\nboomed. We all looked blank. Obscure doesn't even begin to cover it.\n\n\n\nThe next number picked was \"212\". Lindsay did not like that. \"I think we better\n\nshake 'em up,\" he ordered. Debbie fluffed the bits of paper a bit.\n\n\n\nThe countdown continued with Lindsay getting more and more enthusiastic. \"Sir\n\nMalcolm Bruuuuuuce!\" he cried when the Lib-Dem nabbed a slot. When he got number\n\n13, he noted: \"Unlucky for some!\" Through it all, the Eurosceptics examined\n\ntheir lists with the urgency and focus of people conducting brain surgery. You\n\nhave to admire the sheer tenacity of the Euro-obsessive.\n\n\n\n\"The excitement and tension is growing!\" boomed Lindsay as we approached the\n\ngreat moment. Number three was Tory Jonathan Lord, a Euro-rebel, and number two\n\nwas a Labour MP.\n\n\n\n\"Shake 'em up!\" cried Lindsay as the big moment arrived. \"The winner of the day\n\nis ... \" \"One hundred and ninety-nine,\" announced Debbie.\n\n\n\n\"Oooohhhhh!\" cried the audience. Lindsay flipped through his list. \"James\n\nWharton!\" We looked at each other. Who? Still, within minutes, we were being\n\nflooded with information about Mr Wharton. He was the young (aged 29) Tory from\n\nStockton and a Eurosceptic. His majority was tiny (332) and he had made the news\n\nfor being linked with a company that sells stone statues of giant penises.\n\n\n\nSorry, but it's true. It may not be in the best taste but, then, this IS\n\nEurovision.\n\n\n\n"

It also threatened to isolate Ed\n\nMiliband, who is holding out against a referendum.\n\n\n\nThere was further trouble for Mr Cameron when Nadine Dorries, who recently\n\nregained the Conservative whip, said she wanted to explore the possibility of\n\nbeing a Tory-UKIP candidate in 2015.\n\n\n\nParty chiefs would refuse to sign the nomination papers of anyone who wanted to\n\nrun on a joint ticket, senior party sources said, even though such a gambit is\n\ntechnically possible.\n\n\n\nBut the stance sets up a further row with Ms Dorries, who will seek the support\n\nof her Mid Bedfordshire constituency association for winning an endorsement of\n\nNigel Farage, the UKIP leader.\n\n\n\nThe idea is supported by other Tory Eurosceptics, including Peter Bone and\n\nPhilip Hollobone but is regarded with horror by others on the Right.\n\n\n\nVince Cable will inflame Cabinet tensions today by taking on Conservatives who\n\nhave advocated leaving the EU under current terms.

I speak of the eponymous John, Baron of the\n\nEurosceptics, and leader of yesterday's Great EU Referendum rebellion.\n\n\n\n\"Seize the moment,\" he cried, rejecting saying carpe diem as too close to Rome\n\nand, therefore, the EU.\n\n\n\nI looked at The Baron. He is 53 and was, I suspect, born 53. For a Tory\n\npolitician, he looks quite normal. Grey, serious, principled, he is\n\nrighteousness itself. If he rode a horse, and I don't think he's ruled it out,\n\nit would be a black stallion and he would be carrying the flag of truth (no\n\ngolden stars).\n\n\n\n\"Seize the moment,\" he told his own front bench. It is important that all things\n\nin the EU debate are about things that don't exist: the referendum itself won't\n\nmaterialise until 2017, if then, and the amendment to object to what wasn't in\n\nthe Queen's Speech (stay with me here) had no chance of winning yesterday. And\n\nso, keeping with the \"touch the void\" theme, it was perfect that the Prime\n\nMinister was not on the front bench but in New York, where there are no bad EU\n\napples only big ones. Instead, George Osborne was there, listening to the\n\nBaron's plea.\n\n\n\nI must report that George did not seize the moment. Seize the pen, possibly, but\n\nnot the moment. He did allow a tiny grimace to scud over his face like a small\n\ncloud. Was it an emotion or, like a baby, merely wind? We may never know.\n\n\n\nThe Baron urged him to join the rebellion. \"You could claim, quite rightly,\" he\n\ntold George, \"that the situation is not of your making. Blame me! Blame us as a\n\ngroup!\" The Baron explained his cunning plan: with George (and Dave, if he\n\nexisted) on side, the amendment would, somehow, pass. With such a mandate, the\n\nLiberals, as he called them, could not deny time for paving legislation. \"Let\n\nthe media knock on their door and ask questions!\" he cried.\n\n\n\nI quite like the idea of knocking on the Liberal door.\n\n\n\n\"Knock knock,\" we'd say. \"Who's there?\" Nick Clegg would answer.\n\n\n\n\"Questions on the EU.\" \"Ask me in 2017!\" Actually, yesterday began with a\n\nversion of knock-knock. I speak of Prime Minister's Questions starring Mr Clegg\n\nand Harriet Harman. \"If the Prime Minister were here today,\" asked Harriet,\n\nwhich is quite a big \"if\" these days, \"would he be voting for the Government or\n\nagainst the Government, or would he be showing true leadership and abstaining?\"\n\nMr Clegg, effectively, told her to come back in 2017. \"You have used three\n\nquestions to point out that the Prime Minister is not here. That is a striking\n\nobservation - a penetrating insight into the affairs of state today.\"\n\n\n\nI am not sure we learnt much except how seriously The Baron is taking all of\n\nthis. \"This matter is more important than party politics!\" he cried. Around him,\n\nscattered on the benches like confetti, Eurorebel followers nodded. They were\n\nnot wrecking their party, they were saving it. The Baron explained this was a\n\n\"golden opportunity\" to give the electorate a say on the EU. \"We should be bold\n\nof heart, seize the moment and do what is right by the electorate and the\n\ncountry.\"\n\n\n\nNot to mention what was right by John Baron. They lost, but the Baron will live\n\nto fight another day.\n\n\n\n"

It also threatened to isolate Ed\n\nMiliband, who is holding out against a referendum.\n\n\n\nThere was further trouble for Mr Cameron when Nadine Dorries, who recently\n\nregained the Conservative whip, said that she wanted to explore the possibility\n\nof being a Tory-UKIP candidate in 2015.\n\n\n\nParty chiefs would refuse to sign the nomination papers of anyone who wanted to\n\nrun on a joint ticket, senior party sources said, even though such a gambit is\n\ntechnically possible.\n\n\n\nBut the stance sets up a further row with Ms Dorries, who will seek the support\n\nof her Mid Bedfordshire constituency association for winning an endorsement of\n\nNigel Farage, the UKIP leader.\n\n\n\nThe idea is supported by other Tory Eurosceptics, including Peter Bone and\n\nPhilip Hollobone but is regarded with horror by others on the Right.\n\n\n\nVince Cable will increase Cabinet tensions today by taking on Tories who have\n\nadvocated leaving the EU under current terms. The Lib Dem Business Secretary\n\nwill say that \"no serious friend of British business\" would ever advocate\n\nsevering links with Brussels.\n\n\n\nReferring to UKIP's showing in the county council elections this month, he will\n\nsay: \"It is simply self-indulgent and reckless for parties or individuals to\n\nrisk so much in order to address one concern raised in a council election by\n\njust 7 per cent of the electorate.\"\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nLast January, in a long-awaited speech, David Cameron announced that he would\n\noffer the British people a referendum on whether the country should remain\n\nwithin the European Union. If he hoped that this move would stop a surge in\n\nsupport for UKIP or quieten his own troublesome backbenchers, he was mistaken.\n\n\n\nThe promise of a referendum came with various caveats that undermined the\n\ncredibility of his promise. The first was that any vote would not happen until\n\n2017 after a Conservative general election victory. The second was that it would\n\nonly occur after renegotiation. Most Eurosceptics are not optimistic that\n\nrenegotiation will succeed. In his groundbreaking article for The Times, Lord\n\nLawson of Blaby argued that renegotiations were likely to be as \"trivial\" in\n\ntheir results as those delivered by Harold Wilson nearly 40 years ago. It was\n\nfurther contingent on the Prime Minister's word being believed. More than 100\n\nTory MPs, led by John Baron, had warned Mr Cameron that voters had heard too\n\nmany politicians promise referendums, only for those promises to be broken. That\n\nwas why they alighted on the idea that the promise of a referendum should be\n\nenshrined in law, which the Conservative leader had refused to do.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron now finds himself in the humiliating position of having to back a\n\nBill to ensure there is a referendum, a move that only a week ago he had\n\nrejected. Furthermore he knows that his coalition partners and the Labour\n\nOpposition will block the measure. Now the belated addendum to the Queen's\n\nSpeech will wander the corridors of the Palace of Westminster hoping to bump\n\ninto a Conservative MP lucky enough to come in the top three of the ballot for\n\nPrivate Member's Bills. Even if the Bill finds a sponsor, its chances of passing\n\ninto law are small because Labour and Liberal Democrat opponents are likely\n\neither to vote against it or simply talk it out.\n\n\n\nThe tactics have been a mess and the Conservative Party has paraded itself in an\n\nunflattering light. This is unfortunate because Mr Cameron had placed himself in\n\na strong position by promising the people a choice. No one aged under 55 has had\n\na say on Britain's membership of the European Union and that union has changed\n\nfundamentally since Britons were last asked if they wanted to belong to what was\n\nthen called the European Economic Community.\n\n\n\nA pledge to hold a vote also had the electoral merit for the the Conservative\n\nParty of putting the Liberal Democrats and Labour in the awkward position of\n\nlooking as if they did not trust the electorate to have a vote on an institution\n\nthat shapes so many of our laws.\n\n\n\nOur relationship with Europe will need to be recast whoever is prime minister\n\nafter 2015. The eurozone crisis is likely to require its members to move towards\n\nfurther fiscal and political integration, which will automatically change the\n\nnature of Britain's place in Europe. This country needs a debate about the type\n\nof EU that is emerging and the prime minister of the day will need to articulate\n\na new vision, which he is then able to back up in negotiations. At the end of\n\nthat process the people must have the chance either to confirm or to reject the\n\nnew terms of membership.\n\n\n\nWhat the last few days have confirmed is the unhappy relationship that Mr\n\nCameron has with large sections of his own parliamentary party. It has not just\n\nbeen backbenchers rebelling against his European policy. To Downing Street's\n\ndispleasure, Cabinet ministers have declared their willingness to leave the EU\n\nin certain circumstances.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister must work harder at achieving consensus in his party. A more\n\ncollegiate style of leadership will reduce the likelihood of having to adopt\n\npositions from which he later has to retreat.\n\n\n\n"

For\n\nyesterday it seemed as if everything in the Commons was, somehow, connected to\n\nEurope. Exhibit One occurred during yesterday's debate on the environment. David\n\nT.C. Davies, known as Top Cat, who inhabits the wilder shores of Tory\n\nEuroscepticism, was castigating anyone who did not believe in nuclear power.\n\n\n\n\"These people live in some sort of fantasy world believing that if we could just\n\nget rid of technology we could go back to living in some kind of Tolkien-esque\n\nworld like the Hobbits before the evil ones started attacking them, all living\n\nin wonderful grass huts.\"\n\n\n\nCaroline Lucas, our only Green MP, took offence, though I cannot think why. \"I\n\nthought that the discussion about Europe was where we found the fruitcakes!\" she\n\ncried.\n\n\n\nMr Davies took offence on behalf of loaves everywhere: \"It was the fruitcakes\n\nwho warned against the euro ten years ago.

But Top Cat wasn't finished. \"I'm for fruitcakes.\n\nI'm proud to be a fruitcake. Long may fruitcakes continue!\" As this is\n\nWestminster, we have way more fruitcakes than Hobbits. Indeed, yesterday,\n\nNicholas Soames, the Tory battleship who certainly has more than a passing\n\nacquaintance with cake, attacked the Eurosceptics as acting in a \"lunatic way\".\n\nBut Nadine Dorries, or Mad Nad as she is called (which is a good name for a\n\nfruitcake), who has just got the Tory Whip back after her jungle antics,\n\ninsisted that it made more sense to have a Euro referendum than one on AV (it's\n\nthe Lib Dems' fault, of course).\n\n\n\nYesterday, the food fight - sorry, Euro debate - also splattered itself all over\n\nTreasury questions.

(And, no, that wouldn't be\n\nfruitcakes ... ) Danny A repeatedly attacked the Euro rebels' stance, joining\n\nwith Labour to decry a new referendum Bill. But, occasionally, economics\n\nquestions intruded on the fruitiness. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Euro rebel who wants a\n\npact with UKIP, which have patented the original fruitcake recipe, arose to\n\npraise tax cuts for rich people. \"The Laffer curve works and we are better off\n\nwith lower rates,\" he insisted.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday morning Ed Miliband's shadow Cabinet assembled for its weekly meeting.\n\nTop of its agenda was a golden opportunity for Labour to pour petrol on the\n\nblazing European row inside the Conservative Party.\n\n\n\nAll Mr Miliband needed to say was that circumstances had changed since he had\n\nquestioned the need for a referendum on Britain's membership of the European\n\nUnion. It was now obvious, he could have intoned sagely, that the Conservative\n\nParty was so paralysed by its obsession with Europe that it was necessary for\n\nthe issue to be put to bed.\n\n\n\nFor good measure he could have argued that the economic uncertainty caused by\n\nthe internal Tory debate was endangering the nation's prosperity and the\n\nprospects of overseas investment in Britain. And he could have concluded by\n\noffering to give the British people a vote on Europe on the same day as the next\n\nEuropean Parliamentary Elections, in June 2014. In that moment he would have\n\ndared Tory MPs to join him in delivering that referendum or risk looking like\n\nthey were all mouth and no trousers.\n\n\n\nCool heads within Tory ranks would have spotted the trap, but as we've seen over\n\nthe past few days they are currently in short supply. What's more, the spectacle\n\nof being outflanked on Europe - by Red Ed of all people - would have cast a\n\nchill down the spines of even moderate Tory MPs, many of whom are already\n\nunnerved by the UKIP threat.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron would have faced a choice: accede to Mr Miliband's call for an\n\nearly referendum or run the risk of turning infighting into an all out\n\ninsurrection. And if he did accept Mr Miliband's challenge, then what? Would Mr\n\nCameron campaign for withdrawal from Europe and potentially preside over a\n\ndiplomatic and economic calamity? Or fight to stay in, and find himself damned\n\nby his own party for what they would see as one of history's great political\n\nbetrayals? Either way, Ed Miliband couldn't lose. But being Ed Miliband, he has\n\nlost. Not for the first time, Labour's leader has blown it.\n\n\n\n\"Ed said the focus should stay on the Tories\", said one shadow Cabinet insider.\n\n\"He thinks we now have a platform for our case on Europe. We should stick to\n\nit\".\n\n\n\nPresented with the opportunity to seize the day and potentially hasten the end\n\nof the coalition, Mr Miliband instead opted for a short press release. It\n\nstated: \"Labour have said that we don't think committing now to an in/out\n\nreferendum up to four years from now is in the national interest.\"\n\n\n\nLabour's leader litters his speeches with talk of tough choices. But he never\n\nmakes them. For months before the Prime Minister's first major\n\nEuro-announcement, a number of Mr Miliband's colleagues urged him to steal a\n\nmarch on Mr Cameron and pledge a referendum himself. He chose to dither. It\n\nwasn't so much \"wait and see\" but \"wait, then wait some more\".\n\n\n\nLiam Byrne, his shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, urged him to change his\n\nposition on welfare, sensing the political risks it posed for Labour. Again, Mr\n\nMiliband ignored him.\n\n\n\nTime after time Mr Miliband was urged to toughen Labour's line on spending and\n\nthe deficit. Yet as recently as a fortnight ago he was unable to give a coherent\n\nanswer as to whether the next Labour government would borrow more money to boost\n\nthe economy or borrow less.\n\n\n\nIronically, a shift of stance on Europe would actually represent one of the less\n\nrisky options for Ed Miliband. A range of shadow Cabinet figures - as diverse as\n\nEd Balls, Jim Murphy and Jon Cruddas - all back a referendum. At the same time\n\nthe leading trade unions are rekindling the Left's historic suspicion of\n\nEuro-centralisation.\n\n\n\nLabour insiders who back Mr Miliband give a dual rationale for his unwillingness\n\nto offer a referendum. Europe mustn't \"be a distraction\" from the key issues\n\nthat will decide the election. And Mr Miliband's politics must be seen to be\n\nbased on principle, not opportunism.\n\n\n\nFine. But just what is the issue of high principle that Labour's leader is\n\nstanding upon? No one, least of all me, is arguing that he leads a campaign for\n\nBritish exit from the EU. The question is whether to give the British people a\n\nsay on an issue that Mr Miliband himself concedes is one of vital national\n\ninterest.\n\n\n\nLabour is in a political no-man's land. It opposes David Cameron's referendum\n\npledge but claims it is leaving the door open for a similar pledge of its own.\n\nTo hold a referendum today would, it says, be reckless. But in a couple of\n\nyears' time? Labour says: \"Get back to us.\"\n\n\n\nEd Miliband is not actually positioning Labour as the pro-European party. He's\n\npositioning it as the anti-referendum party.\n\n\n\nDan Hodges is a political commentator and former Labour adviser\n\n\n\nHe'd have dared Tory MPs to risk looking all mouth and no trousers\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday morning Ed Miliband's shadow Cabinet assembled for its weekly meeting.\n\nTop of its agenda was a golden opportunity for Labour to pour petrol on the\n\nblazing European row inside the Conservative Party.\n\n\n\nAll Mr Miliband needed to say was that circumstances had changed since he had\n\nquestioned the need for a referendum on Britain's membership of the European\n\nUnion. It was now obvious, he could have intoned sagely, that the Conservative\n\nParty was so paralysed by its obsession with Europe that it was necessary for\n\nthe issue to be put to bed.\n\n\n\nFor good measure he could have argued that the economic uncertainty caused by\n\nthe internal Tory debate was endangering the nation's prosperity and the\n\nprospects of overseas investment in Britain. And he could have concluded by\n\noffering to give the British people a vote on Europe on the same day as the next\n\nEuropean Parliamentary Elections, in June 2014. In that moment he would have\n\ndared Tory MPs to join him in delivering that referendum or risk looking like\n\nthey were all mouth and no trousers.\n\n\n\nCool heads within Tory ranks would have spotted the trap, but as we've seen over\n\nthe past few days they are currently in short supply. What's more, the spectacle\n\nof being outflanked on Europe - by Red Ed of all people - would have cast a\n\nchill down the spines of even moderate Tory MPs, many of whom are already\n\nunnerved by the UKIP threat.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron would have faced a choice: accede to Mr Miliband's call for an\n\nearly referendum or run the risk of turning infighting into an all out\n\ninsurrection. And if he did accept Mr Miliband's challenge, then what? Would Mr\n\nCameron campaign for withdrawal from Europe and potentially preside over a\n\ndiplomatic and economic calamity? Or fight to stay in, and find himself damned\n\nby his own party for what they would see as one of history's great political\n\nbetrayals? Either way, Ed Miliband couldn't lose. But being Ed Miliband, he has\n\nlost. Not for the first time, Labour's leader has blown it.\n\n\n\n\"Ed said the focus should stay on the Tories\", said one shadow Cabinet insider.\n\n\"He thinks we now have a platform for our case on Europe. We should stick to\n\nit\".\n\n\n\nPresented with the opportunity to seize the day and potentially hasten the end\n\nof the coalition, Mr Miliband instead opted for a short press release. It\n\nstated: \"Labour have said that we don't think committing now to an in/out\n\nreferendum up to four years from now is in the national interest.\"\n\n\n\nLabour's leader litters his speeches with talk of tough choices. But he never\n\nmakes them. For months before the Prime Minister's first major\n\nEuro-announcement, a number of Mr Miliband's colleagues urged him to steal a\n\nmarch on Mr Cameron and pledge a referendum himself. He chose to dither. It\n\nwasn't so much \"wait and see\" but \"wait, then wait some more\".\n\n\n\nLiam Byrne, his shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, urged him to change his\n\nposition on welfare, sensing the political risks it posed for Labour. Again, Mr\n\nMiliband ignored him.\n\n\n\nTime after time Mr Miliband was urged to toughen Labour's line on spending and\n\nthe deficit. Yet as recently as a fortnight ago he was unable to give a coherent\n\nanswer as to whether the next Labour government would borrow more money to boost\n\nthe economy or borrow less.\n\n\n\nIronically, a shift of stance on Europe would actually represent one of the less\n\nrisky options for Ed Miliband. A range of shadow Cabinet figures - as diverse as\n\nEd Balls, Jim Murphy and Jon Cruddas - all back a referendum. At the same time\n\nthe leading trade unions are rekindling the Left's historic suspicion of\n\nEuro-centralisation.\n\n\n\nLabour insiders who back Mr Miliband give a dual rationale for his unwillingness\n\nto offer a referendum. Europe mustn't \"be a distraction\" from the key issues\n\nthat will decide the election. And Mr Miliband's politics must be seen to be\n\nbased on principle, not opportunism.\n\n\n\nFine. But just what is the issue of high principle that Labour's leader is\n\nstanding upon? No one, least of all me, is arguing that he leads a campaign for\n\nBritish exit from the EU. The question is whether to give the British people a\n\nsay on an issue that Mr Miliband himself concedes is one of vital national\n\ninterest.\n\n\n\nLabour is in a political no-man's land. It opposes David Cameron's referendum\n\npledge but claims it is leaving the door open for a similar pledge of its own.\n\nTo hold a referendum today would, it says, be reckless. But in a couple of\n\nyears' time? Labour says: \"Get back to us.\"\n\n\n\nEd Miliband is not actually positioning Labour as the pro-European party. He's\n\npositioning it as the anti-referendum party.\n\n\n\nDan Hodges is a political commentator and former Labour adviser\n\n\n\nHe'd have dared Tory MPs to risk looking all mouth and no trousers\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nLast January, in a long-awaited speech, David Cameron announced that he would\n\noffer the British people a referendum on whether the country should remain\n\nwithin the European Union. If he hoped that this move would stop a surge in\n\nsupport for UKIP or quieten his own troublesome backbenchers, he was mistaken.\n\n\n\nThe promise of a referendum came with various caveats that undermined the\n\ncredibility of his promise. The first was that any vote would not happen until\n\n2017 after a Conservative general election victory. The second was that it would\n\nonly occur after renegotiation. Most Eurosceptics are not optimistic that\n\nrenegotiation will succeed. In his groundbreaking article for The Times, Lord\n\nLawson of Blaby argued that renegotiations were likely to be as \"trivial\" in\n\ntheir results as those delivered by Harold Wilson nearly 40 years ago. It was\n\nfurther contingent on the Prime Minister's word being believed. More than 100\n\nTory MPs, led by John Baron, had warned Mr Cameron that voters had heard too\n\nmany politicians promise referendums, only for those promises to be broken. That\n\nwas why they alighted on the idea that the promise of a referendum should be\n\nenshrined in law, which the Conservative leader had refused to do.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron now finds himself in the humiliating position of having to back a\n\nBill to ensure there is a referendum, a move that only a week ago he had\n\nrejected. Furthermore he knows that his coalition partners and the Labour\n\nOpposition will block the measure. Now the belated addendum to the Queen's\n\nSpeech will wander the corridors of the Palace of Westminster hoping to bump\n\ninto a Conservative MP lucky enough to come in the top three of the ballot for\n\nPrivate Member's Bills. Even if the Bill finds a sponsor, its chances of passing\n\ninto law are small because Labour and Liberal Democrat opponents are likely\n\neither to vote against it or simply talk it out.\n\n\n\nThe tactics have been a mess and the Conservative Party has paraded itself in an\n\nunflattering light. This is unfortunate because Mr Cameron had placed himself in\n\na strong position by promising the people a choice. No one aged under 55 has had\n\na say on Britain's membership of the European Union and that union has changed\n\nfundamentally since Britons were last asked if they wanted to belong to what was\n\nthen called the European Economic Community.\n\n\n\nA pledge to hold a vote also had the electoral merit for the the Conservative\n\nParty of putting the Liberal Democrats and Labour in the awkward position of\n\nlooking as if they did not trust the electorate to have a vote on an institution\n\nthat shapes so many of our laws.\n\n\n\nOur relationship with Europe will need to be recast whoever is prime minister\n\nafter 2015. The eurozone crisis is likely to require its members to move towards\n\nfurther fiscal and political integration, which will automatically change the\n\nnature of Britain's place in Europe. This country needs a debate about the type\n\nof EU that is emerging and the prime minister of the day will need to articulate\n\na new vision, which he is then able to back up in negotiations. At the end of\n\nthat process the people must have the chance either to confirm or to reject the\n\nnew terms of membership.\n\n\n\nWhat the last few days have confirmed is the unhappy relationship that Mr\n\nCameron has with large sections of his own parliamentary party. It has not just\n\nbeen backbenchers rebelling against his European policy. To Downing Street's\n\ndispleasure, Cabinet ministers have declared their willingness to leave the EU\n\nin certain circumstances.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister must work harder at achieving consensus in his party. A more\n\ncollegiate style of leadership will reduce the likelihood of having to adopt\n\npositions from which he later has to retreat.\n\n\n\n"

Lord Forsyth of Drumlean became the latest former Cabinet minister\n\nto write off Mr Cameron's EU strategy, saying that the task the Prime Minister\n\nhad set himself was impossible and that he had no hope of persuading Brussels to\n\nreform. \"To use an analogy, I think David Cameron is thinking he can persuade\n\nthe golf club to play tennis,\" the peer told the BBC.\n\n\n\nThe amendment, and the Tory Bill, would write into law Mr Cameron's commitment\n\nto an in-out EU referendum in 2017, on new terms that he plans to negotiate.\n\n\n\nMr Obama's carefully delivered riposte represented a major and rare intervention\n\nby a US President into British domestic politics.\n\n\n\nHe urged voters to wait and see the new relationship Mr Cameron could deliver.\n\n\"I, at least, would be interested in seeing whether or not those are successful\n\nbefore rendering a final judgment,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe White House had previously been opposed to any move towards a British exit,\n\na move that it believes would make its dealings with Europe more difficult.\n\n\n\nAnother Tory row was brewing as some MPs expressed interest in standing as\n\n\"Tory-UKIP\" candidates in the 2015 general election.\n\n\n\nPeter Bone and Philip Hollobone backed the idea of local arrangements, which\n\nallowed Conservative candidates to seek the endorsement of Nigel Farage.\n\n\n\nConservative high command is resisting the idea but Mr Bone said that harnessing\n\nthe Tory and UKIP vote to one candidate would deliver Mr Cameron an overall\n\nmajority. \"There's clearly a holy grail there if we can get the Prime Minister\n\nto give a bit,\" he said.\n\n\n\n"

More than\n\n100 Tory backbenchers, including ministerial aides, are preparing to back an\n\namendment criticising the Queen's Speech in an unusual act of licensed\n\nrebellion.\n\n\n\nThe statute, which is expected to be put to a vote on Wednesday, expresses\n\n\"regret\" at the absence of legislation strengthening Mr Cameron's pledge to hold\n\nan EU referendum in 2017. The Prime Minister will use a three-day trip to the\n\nUnited States today to begin making the case for keeping Britain in the EU, as\n\nhe attempts to move on from the rows engulfing his party.\n\n\n\nBut his Cabinet ministers' comments put Mr Cameron under pressure to toughen his\n\nstance on Europe, amid warnings from a Tory grandee that the Conservative leader\n\nhad \"lost control\" of his party. Mr Cameron has pledged to hold an in-out\n\nreferendum in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next election.\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson re-entered the debate yesterday with a warning that Britain's\n\nproblems would not be solved by leaving Europe because British workers suffer\n\nfrom \"sloth\". The Mayor of London said that he supported legislation to\n\nguarantee a referendum but said the \"sterile debate\" on the EU risked\n\novershadowing more important questions on the economy. He wrote in\n\n\n\nThe Daily Telegraph: \"If we left the EU, we would end this sterile debate, and\n\nwe would have to recognise that most of our problems are not caused by\n\n'Bwussels', but by chronic British shorttermism, inadequate management, sloth,\n\nlow skills, a culture of easy gratification and underinvestment in human and\n\nphysical capital and infrastructure.\"\n\n\n\nIn a speech in January setting out his pledge, the Prime Minister indicated that\n\nhe favoured staying in Europe, warning that leaving the EU would rob Britain of\n\ninfluence and threaten jobs and security. At the time, he said that he would\n\nfight \"with all my heart and soul\" to campaign to stay in if he could secure\n\nsome kind of new settlement.\n\n\n\nMr Gove, in an interview yesterday, said that he supported the Prime Minister's\n\nplan to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe before holding a poll.\n\nHowever, he admitted that he would vote \"no\" if a referendum were held today.\n\n\"Life outside would be perfectly tolerable. There would be certain advantages,\"\n\nhe said.\n\n\n\nMr Hammond echoed his remarks, saying yesterday that it would be \"defeatist\" to\n\nleave the EU without attempting reform.\n\n\n\nMichael Portillo, a former Defence Secretary, said that Mr Cameron \"is in a very\n\ndifficult position and clearly doesn't have control of his party\". A third\n\nCabinet minister, Chris Grayling, also appeared to indicate that he supported\n\nleaving the EU. In an interview with The Sunday Times he said that Britain\n\n\"cannot and should not continue without a change in its current relationship\n\nwith the European Union\". Downing Street sources said that Mr Cameron remained\n\n\"very relaxed\" about the amendment, but No 10 has moved to limit the damage by\n\nallowing backbenchers and parliamentary private secretaries a free vote.\n\nMinisters will be expected to abstain, creating the situation in which they will\n\nnot vote to back their own government's legislative programme.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister will try to shift the debate today by saying as he meets\n\nPresident Obama that a possible trade deal between the EU and the US could add\n\nÂ£10 billion to Britain's economy. Mr Gove also tried to deflect attention on to\n\nthe Lib Dems by suggesting that there was a plot to topple Nick Clegg as leader.\n\nHe said that the Deputy Prime Minister had opposed plans to allow nursery staff\n\nto look after more children at any one time only in a move to shore up his\n\nposition.\n\n\n\nMr Gove alleged that there was a \"campaign\" led by Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove\n\nBay to \"destablise\" Mr Clegg to make way for Vince Cable to take over as leader.\n\nLib Dem sources moved quickly to insist that Mr Clegg was expected to lead the\n\nparty unchallenged into the 2015 general election.\n\n\n\nLabour are expected to join the Lib Dems in opposing the amendment. Ed Balls,\n\nthe Shadow Chancellor, said that it would be \"destabilising\" to commit to a\n\nreferendum while there was an effort to reform the EU.\n\n\n\n"

There are few unemployed immigrants. They find employment rather\n\nrapidly or start their own business. They see an opportunity and that is why\n\nthey emigrate. It follows, does it not, that those jobs and business\n\nopportunities existed before the immigrant arrived in the UK? Perhaps those who\n\nvote UKIP should ask why Britons didn't exploit those opportunities.\n\n\n\nImmigration will always continue.\n\n\n\nUK companies want immigration. It keeps the UK competitive.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nLord Lawson has posed an essential question. When a new Europe emerges after the\n\neuro crisis it will be time to decide whether Britain wishes to remain a member\n\nWhen Harold Wilson renegotiated the British position in the European Common\n\nMarket in 1975 his empty-handed return was greeted as a triumph.\n\n\n\nWilson had taken the precaution not just of specifying in advance what a\n\nsuccessful venture would look like but travelling in the knowledge that success\n\nwas already assured. For all the fanfare that accompanied the supposed\n\nrenegotiation, the process was cosmetic and, strictly in terms of political\n\nchicanery, successful.\n\n\n\nThis is not the position that David Cameron finds himself in as he contemplates\n\na new settlement of British's relationship with the European Union. Lord Lawson\n\nof Blaby yesterday became the first senior politician to call explicitly for\n\nBritish withdrawal. Lord Lawson's intervention is welcome because it will\n\nprecipitate a resolution of the question that has hung over British politics\n\nsince the formation of the single currency - whether our destiny as a nation is\n\npartly within the EU or wholly without.\n\n\n\nLord Lawson puts his finger on the main point at issue, which is whether the\n\nPrime Minister can really expect to come back with substantively positive\n\nchanges to Britain's position. Mr Cameron has set out a grand vision of the\n\nEurope he would like to see but he has pointedly not specified the clauses and\n\npowers that he would like repatriated to Britain. It is not yet obvious, even by\n\nMr Cameron's own lights, what a successful negotiation would look like.\n\n\n\nIt has to be said that this is hardly Mr Cameron's fault. The European Union is\n\nin the midst of the most severe fiscal crisis in its short history. Member\n\nstates have clung on tenaciously to the euro but an abiding solution is elusive\n\nand the economic states of Greece, Portugal and Spain remain parlous. France and\n\nthe Netherlands are hardly healthy, either. In due course, some further economic\n\nand fiscal union will be necessary but the political elites, especially in\n\nGermany, know that they do not have the consent of their electorates for any\n\nfurther integration.\n\n\n\nWhatever the final upshot of the eurozone mess, a Europe will emerge out of the\n\ncrisis that differs from the Europe that entered it. It is sensible in those\n\ncircumstances to await the settlement that the eurozone members arrive at before\n\ncoming to a definitive judgment. It makes sense to assess the nature of the\n\nEuropean Union of which we remain a member before deciding whether or not to\n\nremain so.\n\n\n\nThat will also be a good moment to renegotiate Britain's position, which will\n\nchange purely as a result of the further integration that is inevitable in the\n\neurozone. If Mr Cameron were able to use this moment to secure a reduction in\n\nthe regulatory burden that comes from Brussels, protect the future of financial\n\nservices in the City of London, limit encroachment on foreign and defence policy\n\nand control our borders, his renegotiation would have proved worthwhile.\n\n\n\nIt would, however, be naive to be optimistic about the Prime Minister's chance\n\nof success. There are 26 other nations in the EU, all of whom well may demand\n\nspecial treatment if favours are granted to Britain. It may be that the British\n\nrebate is the price that Mr Cameron would have to pay, and even then he would\n\nnot be offered much. Though Britain is not entirely without allies, Mr Cameron's\n\nsemi-detached stance has not endeared him to those whose support he will depend\n\nupon for a successful outcome. There is, also, the barrier of a general election\n\nbetween the pledge of a referendum on a mooted new bargain.\n\n\n\nThere is much about the future of Europe that is uncertain but the day is coming\n\nwhen, almost four decades after the first referendum on Europe, the question\n\nwill need to be settled again and, as our poll shows today, the mood in Britain\n\nis hardening against Europe.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nShould we stay in the EU or leave? Before we can even answer that question we\n\nhave to first understand the true nature of the European project. Not the idea\n\nof an Economic Community as sold to the British people in the 1975 referendum.\n\nNot the EU as mainstream politicians still describe it. Nor even the EU of bendy\n\nbananas and crooked expenses that appears in the tabloids. It's time to think\n\nabout the real European Union and its fundamental characteristics. Three stand\n\nout to me.\n\n\n\nThe first is that the EU has already largely left Britain behind. It has left us\n\nbefore we have even begun to consider whether we want to leave it. The second\n\nfeature is that today's EU is characterised by an increasing concentration of\n\neconomic power. And, third, the modern EU is both undemocratic and, worse, there\n\nis no great demand from within any other major European power for this\n\ndemocratic deficit to be addressed.\n\n\n\nLet's take each characteristic in turn.\n\n\n\nFirst, the direction of travel of the European project - a direction that is\n\ntaking it further and further away from Britain. Whenever Britain's relationship\n\nwith the EU is discussed there is much talk of trains leaving stations and of\n\nBritain missing boats. These metaphors have sometimes been misused but, today,\n\nwith the EU's political establishment determined not just to defend monetary\n\nunion but to move towards political union it is not a question of whether\n\nBritain should jump on a train or boat. The issue is that the train has already\n\nleft the station; Britain is already outside the main club and is excluded from\n\nkey decisions.\n\n\n\nIn his article in The Times yesterday Lord Lawson spelt out the consequences of\n\nthis. Our European partners are already devising laws and regulations that are\n\nto the detriment of key British industries, notably financial services. This is\n\nnot some future threat. It is today's reality. Most significantly the detachment\n\nis set to become greater as other EU leaders add political and fiscal union to\n\nmonetary union.\n\n\n\nThe second feature is the concentration of economic power in an ever more\n\ncentralised eurozone. Unfortunately Europe lacks a figure of Helmut Kohl's\n\noutlook. The former German Chancellor believed that his country had to keep\n\nmaking concessions to ensure all EU nations felt that it was a genuine\n\npartnership. This was what he sought to achieve by giving smaller nations\n\ndisproportionate voting rights in decision-making.\n\n\n\nWhen David Cameron says it is in Britain's interest to have a strong,\n\nfunctioning eurozone and fiscal union, is he even aware of basic European\n\nhistory? Has he no understanding that ever closer union is building something\n\nthat conflicts with the historical objectives of British foreign policy?

Not the idea\n\nof an Economic Community as sold to the British people in the 1975 referendum.\n\nNot the EU as mainstream politicians still describe it. Nor even the EU of bendy\n\nbananas and crooked expenses that appears in the tabloids. It's time to think\n\nabout the real European Union and its fundamental characteristics. Three stand\n\nout to me.\n\n\n\nThe first is that the EU has already largely left Britain behind. It has left us\n\nbefore we have even begun to consider whether we want to leave it. The second\n\nfeature is that today's EU is characterised by an increasing concentration of\n\neconomic power. And, third, the modern EU is both undemocratic and, worse, there\n\nis no great demand from within any other major European power for this\n\ndemocratic deficit to be addressed.\n\n\n\nLet's take each characteristic in turn.\n\n\n\nFirst, the direction of travel of the European project - a direction that is\n\ntaking it further and further away from Britain. Whenever Britain's relationship\n\nwith the EU is discussed there is much talk of trains leaving stations and of\n\nBritain missing boats. These metaphors have sometimes been misused but, today,\n\nwith the EU's political establishment determined not just to defend monetary\n\nunion but to move towards political union it is not a question of whether\n\nBritain should jump on a train or boat. The issue is that the train has already\n\nleft the station; Britain is already outside the main club and is excluded from\n\nkey decisions.\n\n\n\nIn his article in The Times yesterday Lord Lawson spelt out the consequences of\n\nthis. Our European partners are already devising laws and regulations that are\n\nto the detriment of key British industries, notably financial services. This is\n\nnot some future threat. It is today's reality. Most significantly the detachment\n\nis set to become greater as other EU leaders add political and fiscal union to\n\nmonetary union.\n\n\n\nThe second feature is the concentration of economic power in an ever more\n\ncentralised eurozone. Unfortunately Europe lacks a figure of Helmut Kohl's\n\noutlook. The former German Chancellor believed that his country had to keep\n\nmaking concessions to ensure all EU nations felt that it was a genuine\n\npartnership. This was what he sought to achieve by giving smaller nations\n\ndisproportionate voting rights in decision-making.\n\n\n\nWhen David Cameron says it is in Britain's interest to have a strong,\n\nfunctioning eurozone and fiscal union, is he even aware of basic European\n\nhistory? Has he no understanding that ever closer union is building something\n\nthat conflicts with the historical objectives of British foreign policy? One\n\nhundred years ago Britain fought a war to stop the continent being dominated by\n\na single power. There is nothing in the coalition's strategy that will prevent\n\nthis new concentration of power on our doorstep. We may hope the push to ever\n\ncloser union might fail, and there is a good chance that it will, but hope is\n\nnot a strategy. Mr Cameron's review of competences - like John Major's review 20\n\nyears ago - does not begin to tackle the challenges posed by the emergence of\n\nthis European superstate.\n\n\n\nThe third feature of today's EU is a lack of democracy. In a democracy the voter\n\ncan change how they are governed; in the existing EU there is almost no talk of\n\nthis kind of accountability and the European Parliament is remote from the\n\npeople. The European project is proceeding without any serious discussion of how\n\ndemocracy might be advanced.\n\n\n\nThere is no serious force in continental politics that is worried about the\n\nundemocratic direction of Europe. It is sometimes said that the new, supposedly\n\nEurosceptic party - Alternative for Germany - shows that opinion is changing in\n\nGermany. In my dealings with the AfD I see a party that is unhappy at Germany's\n\nlack of control of European institutions and is concerned that they do not\n\nprovide sufficient benefits for Germans.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nLord Lawson has posed an essential question. When a new Europe emerges after the\n\neuro crisis it will be time to decide whether Britain wishes to remain a member\n\nWhen Harold Wilson renegotiated the British position in the European Common\n\nMarket in 1975 his empty-handed return was greeted as a triumph.\n\n\n\nWilson had taken the precaution not just of specifying in advance what a\n\nsuccessful venture would look like but travelling in the knowledge that success\n\nwas already assured. For all the fanfare that accompanied the supposed\n\nrenegotiation, the process was cosmetic and, strictly in terms of political\n\nchicanery, successful.\n\n\n\nThis is not the position that David Cameron finds himself in as he contemplates\n\na new settlement of British's relationship with the European Union. Lord Lawson\n\nof Blaby yesterday became the first senior politician to call explicitly for\n\nBritish withdrawal. Lord Lawson's intervention is welcome because it will\n\nprecipitate a resolution of the question that has hung over British politics\n\nsince the formation of the single currency - whether our destiny as a nation is\n\npartly within the EU or wholly without.\n\n\n\nLord Lawson puts his finger on the main point at issue, which is whether the\n\nPrime Minister can really expect to come back with substantively positive\n\nchanges to Britain's position. Mr Cameron has set out a grand vision of the\n\nEurope he would like to see but he has pointedly not specified the clauses and\n\npowers that he would like repatriated to Britain. It is not yet obvious, even by\n\nMr Cameron's own lights, what a successful negotiation would look like.\n\n\n\nIt has to be said that this is hardly Mr Cameron's fault. The European Union is\n\nin the midst of the most severe fiscal crisis in its short history. Member\n\nstates have clung on tenaciously to the euro but an abiding solution is elusive\n\nand the economic states of Greece, Portugal and Spain remain parlous. France and\n\nthe Netherlands are hardly healthy, either. In due course, some further economic\n\nand fiscal union will be necessary but the political elites, especially in\n\nGermany, know that they do not have the consent of their electorates for any\n\nfurther integration.\n\n\n\nWhatever the final upshot of the eurozone mess, a Europe will emerge out of the\n\ncrisis that differs from the Europe that entered it. It is sensible in those\n\ncircumstances to await the settlement that the eurozone members arrive at before\n\ncoming to a definitive judgment. It makes sense to assess the nature of the\n\nEuropean Union of which we remain a member before deciding whether or not to\n\nremain so.\n\n\n\nThat will also be a good moment to renegotiate Britain's position, which will\n\nchange purely as a result of the further integration that is inevitable in the\n\neurozone. If Mr Cameron were able to use this moment to secure a reduction in\n\nthe regulatory burden that comes from Brussels, protect the future of financial\n\nservices in the City of London, limit encroachment on foreign and defence policy\n\nand control our borders, his renegotiation would have proved worthwhile.\n\n\n\nIt would, however, be naive to be optimistic about the Prime Minister's chance\n\nof success. There are 26 other nations in the EU, all of whom well may demand\n\nspecial treatment if favours are granted to Britain. It may be that the British\n\nrebate is the price that Mr Cameron would have to pay, and even then he would\n\nnot be offered much. Though Britain is not entirely without allies, Mr Cameron's\n\nsemi-detached stance has not endeared him to those whose support he will depend\n\nupon for a successful outcome. There is, also, the barrier of a general election\n\nbetween the pledge of a referendum on a mooted new bargain.\n\n\n\nThere is much about the future of Europe that is uncertain but the day is coming\n\nwhen, almost four decades after the first referendum on Europe, the question\n\nwill need to be settled again and, as our poll shows today, the mood in Britain\n\nis hardening against Europe.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nVoters and Tory MPs warned David Cameron that he must scale back Britain's\n\nrelationship with the European Union to little more than free trade or risk\n\nlosing a referendum.\n\n\n\nAs Lord Lawson of Blaby's call for Britain to quit the EU sent shockwaves\n\nthrough Westminster, senior MPs challenged the Prime Minister to scrap most of\n\nthe Union's powers.\n\n\n\nA shopping list being drawn up by influential backbenchers includes social and\n\nemployment law, the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy and\n\njustice and home affairs legislation.\n\n\n\nShould Mr Cameron fail to negotiate a new relationship with Brussels more akin\n\nto a common market, MPs warned that he would find a significant number of his\n\nparliamentary party turning against him in his promised referendum.\n\n\n\nThe stance is backed by a poll today which shows a majority of voters want\n\neither a completely new relationship with the EU or to leave altogether. Forty\n\ntwo per cent of voters said that they wanted a relationship based on free trade\n\nand little else while 21 per cent called for British withdrawal, according to\n\nthe YouGov poll for The Times.\n\n\n\nIf there was an in-out referendum tomorrow, 46 per cent said they would vote to\n\nquit the EU against 35 per cent who would vote to stay in.\n\n\n\nIt also shows deep public scepticism about Mr Cameron's assertion that he can,\n\nand will, secure substantial changes as he negotiates with fellow EU leaders\n\nduring the next four years. More than half of voters (53 per cent) said that\n\nthey believed the fruits of his negotiations would be small.\n\n\n\nThe findings came as the Tory back benches fractured in response to Lord\n\nLawson's bombshell in The Times yesterday.\n\n\n\nDavid Davis, the senior MP, said that the former Chancellor's intervention was\n\n\"like throwing a sugar cube into a bottle of Coke\". It altered the balance of\n\nthe argument dramatically. \"He has made aggressive Euroscepticism mainstream.\"\n\n\n\nMr Davis, who supports the drive for a recast relationship rather than swift\n\nwithdrawal, urged Mr Cameron to adopt a \"more muscular approach\" when dealing\n\nwith EU leaders, arguing that Lord Lawson's call for a British exit may help to\n\nstrengthen the Prime Minister's negotiating hand.\n\n\n\n\"The settlement we might get could be a lot better,\" he said, but only if Mr\n\nCameron talked tougher.\n\n\n\nMr Davis added: \"It doesn't necessarily end up with us leaving. It may end up\n\nwith a much better deal. The more serious we are about leaving the less likely\n\nit is to happen. But the Prime Minister has to employ a more muscular approach.\"\n\n\n\nMr Cameron insisted that Lord Lawson's intervention marked a good day for his\n\nEuropean strategy, to promise an in-out referendum in 2017 on the results of a\n\nrenegotiation. But Lord Lawson dismissed the approach, saying that anything he\n\nsecured in talks with the 26 other EU leaders would be inconsequential.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister said: \"I want to give people a choice not between the status\n\nquo and leaving the EU.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the way to the Prime Minister's press conference, I walked by a sign that\n\nproclaimed \"The Duel for Europe\". I peered more closely at the poster. Had it\n\ncome to this? Pistols at dawn with Nigel Farage? And then I saw the smaller\n\ntype: \"British diplomacy in war and peace, 1800 to 1830s\".\n\n\n\nPlus Ã§a change! Oops, sorry, didn't mean to go all French there. The press\n\nconference was at the Foreign Office - so much grander than No 10 that I don't\n\nknow why Dave doesn't use it more often. Here they see Europe in all its\n\nhistorical perspective and not anything to do with Nigel Farage or, indeed, that\n\nother Nigel, as in Lawson, who yesterday revealed that he wants to leave the EU.\n\n\n\nThe press conference was supposed to be about Somalia. I wondered if, a la\n\nWomen's Institute, anyone would come dressed as a pirate (or indeed, a dueller).\n\nBritain had hosted this conference on Somalia, which is struggling to tackle\n\nterrorism, crime and piracy (down 80 per cent, don't tell the WI). But I think\n\nwe all knew that the press conference, for Dave at least, was going to be about\n\nEurope.\n\n\n\nSure enough, the first question from the UK side began: \"On the domestic front.\"\n\nDid I see Dave's jaw tense? His hair is getting greyer again around the back. I\n\nwondered if Dave had heard Lord Lawson, being interviewed by Martha Kearney on\n\nthe World at One earlier, delivering a truly masterful putdown.\n\n\n\nMartha: \"Nick Clegg says if were to leave the EU, it would jeopardise up to\n\nthree million jobs.\"\n\n\n\nNigel L: \"That is poppycock. I don't think Nick Clegg, who is a charming young\n\nman, has ever purported to know anything about economics.\"\n\n\n\nI looked at Dave, another charming young man, who now was adopting the\n\nwide-legged stance of someone under attack. This was the brace position or,\n\npossibly, the precursor to doing the splits, something Tories know a lot about.\n\n\n\n\"Do you agree that it's been a good day for UKIP, thanks to one of your own?\"\n\nasked the hack. Surely Dave should be able to convince the likes of Nigel Lawson\n\nto stay in the EU.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's been a good day!\" cried Dave, legs so wide that I feared for his\n\ninside trouser seams.\n\n\n\nGood day? I do hope this was not, dare I say it, poppycock. Dave explained how\n\nmarvellous it was that people were talking about his promise for an in-out\n\nreferendum.\n\n\n\n\"I welcome the attention that is being placed on this key pledge that I have\n\nmade,\" he said, hands gripping the side of the lectern. \"Only the Conservatives\n\nare making this promise!\"\n\n\n\nDave now explained that his \"key pledge\" would give us a \"proper\" choice. Ah\n\nyes, \"proper\". This is one of my Dave alert words. It's an all encompassing\n\ncomfort word that he uses to convince people he is right. Expect to hear a lot\n\nof it on Europe.\n\n\n\n\"Frankly I welcome the attention that is being put on this very clear promise!\"\n\nhe trilled. OK Dave, I think we have got the idea. It's been a great day - but\n\nonly if your name is Nigel.\n\n\n\n"

So how much more successful will they be at the next general and\n\nEuropean elections? vivian linacre Perth Sir, UKIP's modest success at the polls\n\nshould not be blown out of proportion. With only about one third of the\n\nelectorate voting, UKIP picked up some seats and it's safe to assume that anyone\n\nwho wanted to vote UKIP did so; apathy once again ruled the day. However, UKIP\n\ndoes deserve to be taken seriously. They are not clowns, just the typical pub\n\nbore who knows what's wrong with everything but has no realistic suggestions.\n\n\n\nThe evidence all over Europe is that spend now, pay later doesn't work.

However, these votes probably won't translate\n\nto seats in 2015. The decline of the Lib Dems, combined with UKIP winning lots\n\nof votes but few seats (if any), could result in fewer MPs from the smaller\n\nparties, not more. In that sense the general election could herald a shift back\n\ntowards two-party politics.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, as a consequence of more diverse voting there could be a stalemate\n\nbetween the number of Labour and Tory MPs, with no third force to form a\n\ncoalition. Would Labour then form a coalition with the SNP? Would the\n\nConservatives look to Northern Ireland? Perhaps, like 1974, we might end up with\n\nmore than one general election. paul hackett Director, Smith Institute Sir, The\n\noutcome of local elections nearly always reflects voters' opinion of the\n\nperformance of the national government, with the policies of local candidates\n\nbeing largely ignored.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron was forced to eat his words last night after UKIP stunned the\n\nestablishment with massive electoral gains.\n\n\n\nAs Nigel Farage's insurgent party attracted almost every fourth vote in county\n\ncouncil elections, the Prime Minister vowed to respect those he had previously\n\nderided as \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\".\n\n\n\nThe 139 seats seized by UKIP across the country surpassed expectations and\n\nredrew the political map of Britain - for the time being at least - into a\n\nfour-party state.\n\n\n\nIn Westminster, the jolt to Tory morale triggered a feverish response. It\n\nincluded: ? Senior Tories warning Mr Cameron to bring the MP Nadine Dorries back\n\ninto the fold before she defected to UKIP.\n\n\n\n? Nirj Deva, an MEP, becoming the first Tory to advocate a Tory-UKIP pact in the\n\n2015 election.\n\n\n\n? Michael Gove being forced to dismiss renewed leadership chatter by saying that\n\nthe idea of replacing Mr Cameron was \"bonkerooney\". Ms Dorries, who has not had\n\nthe Tory whip returned since appearing on I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of\n\nHere! was at the centre of speculation last night about her future. Although\n\nsome Tories suspect that she is about to jump ship, the Mid Bedfordshire MP\n\nsaid: \"I'm a Conservative and I've been a Conservative and hopefully I'll remain\n\na Conservative.\" The biggest victims were the Tories, who lost more than 335\n\ncouncillors and control of 10 county councils, including the Prime Minister's\n\nhome county of Oxfordshire. Labour took the biggest share of the vote at 29 per\n\ncent and won 291 seats but failed to make a significant breakthrough in the\n\nSouth.\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Democrats received a local election hammering for the third year\n\nrunning, losing 124 seats and finishing seventh in the South Shields\n\nby-election.\n\n\n\nUKIP took 23 per cent of the vote, two points behind the Tories and nine points\n\nahead of the Lib Dems. Mr Farage hailed the result as \"a game changer\".\n\n\n\nMr Cameron led a shell-shocked political class in saying that he would \"work\n\nreally hard\" to win back Tory deserters.

The analysis shows that of those who\n\nvoted Conservative in 2010, 73 per cent would still vote Tory, 6 per cent\n\nLabour, 2 per cent Liberal Democrat and 18 per cent UKIP. Labour's vote is\n\nholding up well, with 88 per cent of those voting for the party in 2010 still\n\nintending to vote the same way, 2 per cent switching to the Liberal Democrats\n\nand 4 per cent going to UKIP. The Lib Dem vote is changing most with 11 per cent\n\nswitching to the Tories, 34 per cent going to Labour and 8 per cent going to\n\nUKIP.\n\n\n\nThe pollsters analysed the voting intentions of almost 30,000 people, of whom\n\n9,287 voted Tory, 7,488 Labour and 6,675 Liberal Democrat in 2010.\n\n\n\nBut Mr Cameron may be more concerned about related polling data from the past\n\ntwo days which shows that there is a higher proportion of Tories who are\n\nconsidering voting UKIP but haven't made their mind up yet than either of the\n\nother two parties. Some 20 per cent of Tories, 16 per cent of Labour voters and\n\n3 per cent of Lib Dems are considering switching to UKIP.\n\n\n\nThe most recent data also shows that UKIP voters care most about immigration (76\n\nper cent) followed by leaving the EU (59 per cent) . Mr Farage is popular with\n\nUKIP voters because he has a common sense approach, and \"speaks my language\".\n\nSenior Labour sources were confident that the party would hold on to the South\n\nShields seat, vacated by David Miliband, the former Foreign Secretary.\n\n\n\nBut both Labour and UKIP organisers detected a groundswell for Mr Farage's party\n\nduring polling. Some were predicting that it would secure more than a quarter of\n\nthe votes cast.\n\n\n\n\"It's been like a carnival there at times for us,\" a senior UKIP source said.\n\n\"We've had people honking and waving at us. It's been really quite something.\"\n\n\n\nIt would represent an early election blow for David Cameron. The Conservatives\n\nfinished second in the seat at the last election, when UKIP did not contest it.\n\nBut there were signs yesterday that the Tories would be pushed into third.

David Cameron refused to say\n\nwhether he would encourage his elderly relatives to hand back their winter fuel\n\nallowance, as advocated by Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary.\n\n\n\nSenior Tories were at odds over how to handle the threat of UKIP, with No 10 and\n\nBoris Johnson telling the likes of Continued on page 11, col 1\n\n\n\nContinued from page 1 Ken Clarke to ignore the insurgent party rather than\n\ninsulting its candidates and supporters.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron was told that he may have to toughen his promise of an EU referendum\n\nin the next Parliament if the Tories suffer badly at the hands of UKIP this\n\nweek.\n\n\n\nAnd trouble flared when Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory deputy chairman,\n\nsuggested that headlines about Lynton Crosby, Mr Cameron's Australian\n\nstrategist, were a bad sign. Lord Ashcroft, who has an uneasy relationship with\n\nthe man dubbed \"the wizard of Oz\", tweeted: \"Lynton Crosby becoming the story.\n\nDirty linen/public. Whatever the merits not good for the Tories.\" Mr Crosby has\n\ndenied Sunday newspaper reports that he regarded George Osborne, the Chancellor,\n\nas a liability and Grant Shapps, the Tory chairman, as lightweight.\n\n\n\nMr Miliband's appearance on yesterday's The World At One on Radio 4 was timed to\n\ncoincide with publication of six Bills Labour said would provide economic shock\n\ntherapy.\n\n\n\nThey include a temporary VAT cut from 20 per cent to 17.5 per cent; cutting VAT\n\nto 5 per cent for home repairs for a year; cutting national insurance payments\n\nfor small firms who hire new workers; reintroducing the 10p starting rate of\n\nincome tax; reintroducing the 50p top rate of income tax.\n\n\n\nThe Tories put the overall cost of the measures at more than Â£28 billion.\n\n\n\nMr Miliband was asked repeatedly to confirm that the measures would mean a\n\nshort-term rise in borrowing, but he repeatedly dodged the questions, saying\n\nthat the economic growth engendered by his measures would see borrowing fall\n\nover time. \"I don't accept that borrowing would be higher under a Labour\n\ngovernment because borrowing would be lower in the medium term,\" he said. \"The\n\npoint is that they haven't got the growth.\"\n\n\n\nMr Miliband, asked to say how he would bring down welfare spending, said the\n\nanswer was to get people back to work. Labour's \"jobs guarantee\" is aimed at the\n\n160,000 people over 25 who have been out of work for more than two years and the\n\n70,000 of young people unemployed for more than 12 months. The Government would\n\nhelp to pay their wages for a year and they would lose benefits if they refused\n\nto take up a job offer.\n\n\n\nBut some Labour MPs believe that the party must go further to persuade voters\n\nthat it can control the welfare bill. Mr Osborne has made clear that he intends\n\nto make cuts to working age benefits a key election dividing line. Rachel\n\nSylvester, Opinion, page 17\n\n\n\nContinued from page 1 Ken [...]\n\n\n\n"

David Cameron refused to say\n\nwhether he would encourage his elderly relatives to hand back their winter fuel\n\nallowance, as advocated by Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary.\n\n\n\nSenior Tories were at odds over how to handle the threat of UKIP, with No 10 and\n\nBoris Johnson telling the likes of Continued on page 11, col 1\n\n\n\nContinued from page 1 Ken Clarke to ignore the insurgent party rather than\n\ninsulting its candidates and supporters.\n\n\n\nMr Cameron was told that he may have to toughen his promise of an EU referendum\n\nin the next Parliament if the Tories suffer badly at the hands of UKIP this\n\nweek.\n\n\n\nAnd trouble flared when Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory deputy chairman,\n\nsuggested that headlines about Lynton Crosby, Mr Cameron's Australian\n\nstrategist, were a bad sign. Lord Ashcroft, who has an uneasy relationship with\n\nthe man dubbed \"the wizard of Oz\", tweeted: \"Lynton Crosby becoming the story.\n\nDirty linen/public. Whatever the merits not good for the Tories.\" Mr Crosby has\n\ndenied Sunday newspaper reports that he regarded George Osborne, the Chancellor,\n\nas a liability and Grant Shapps, the Tory chairman, as lightweight.\n\n\n\nMr Miliband's appearance on yesterday's The World At One on Radio 4 was timed to\n\ncoincide with publication of six Bills Labour said would provide economic shock\n\ntherapy.\n\n\n\nThey include a temporary VAT cut from 20 per cent to 17.5 per cent; cutting VAT\n\nto 5 per cent for home repairs for a year; cutting national insurance payments\n\nfor small firms who hire new workers; reintroducing the 10p starting rate of\n\nincome tax; reintroducing the 50p top rate of income tax.\n\n\n\nThe Tories put the overall cost of the measures at more than Â£28 billion.\n\n\n\nMr Miliband was asked repeatedly to confirm that the measures would mean a\n\nshort-term rise in borrowing, but he repeatedly dodged the questions, saying\n\nthat the economic growth engendered by his measures would see borrowing fall\n\nover time. \"I don't accept that borrowing would be higher under a Labour\n\ngovernment because borrowing would be lower in the medium term,\" he said. \"The\n\npoint is that they haven't got the growth.\"\n\n\n\nMr Miliband, asked to say how he would bring down welfare spending, said the\n\nanswer was to get people back to work. Labour's \"jobs guarantee\" is aimed at the\n\n160,000 people over 25 who have been out of work for more than two years and the\n\n70,000 of young people unemployed for more than 12 months. The Government would\n\nhelp to pay their wages for a year and they would lose benefits if they refused\n\nto take up a job offer.\n\n\n\nBut some Labour MPs believe that the party must go further to persuade voters\n\nthat it can control the welfare bill. Mr Osborne has made clear that he intends\n\nto make cuts to working age benefits a key election dividing line. Rachel\n\nSylvester, Opinion, page 23\n\n\n\nContinued from page 1 Ken [...]\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was covering Margaret Thatcher's funeral last week, the man standing next\n\nto me struck up a conversation. That's nice, I thought, partly because I thought\n\nhe might be good for a quote, partly because much of the appeal of these big\n\nnational occasions is that the usual barriers come down and those who might not\n\notherwise do so start to chat to one another. I, in common with most people I\n\nassume, believe such random interactions between strangers to be a good thing.\n\n\n\nAnd for about three minutes, this one was. This chap was pleasant and polite. We\n\nestablished that while we both originated in the North, we were now living down\n\nsouth, me in East London, him in Hampshire. We agreed the deceased had done some\n\ngood things, some bad things. We concurred that Britain handled ceremony\n\nsuperbly well, and, on balance, Maggie merited a decent sendoff.\n\n\n\n\"Not the same country now though, is it?\" he said. I asked him what he meant,\n\ndespite having a pretty good idea. \"Well,\" he said, gesturing at a couple of\n\nmixed-race spectators near by, \"you know what I'm saying.\" Do you mean, I asked,\n\nnot the same country now as in when Mrs Thatcher was running it, or not the same\n\ncountry now as in London is different from where you live. \"Both,\" he answered.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, this chap was right.\n\n\n\nBritain is very different in 2013 than it was in 1990, when Mrs Thatcher left\n\nDowning Street, let alone in 1979, when she arrived there. And London (37 per\n\ncent of its residents born abroad, as against 13 per cent for the whole of\n\nEngland and Wales) is very different from the rest of Britain. The question is,\n\nwhether you think these differences are welcome or not. I think they are; this\n\nchap didn't. We didn't have a lot more to say to each other.\n\n\n\nIt's a stand-off, and it needs to be resolved.\n\n\n\nWe read about the North-South divide, and in economic and political terms, that\n\ndivide persists. In cultural terms, however, or more accurately in psychological\n\nterms, the divide between London and pretty much everywhere else (begging the\n\npardon of the progressive enclaves in the other big cities) is becoming as\n\nsignificant. When I go home to East Yorkshire, I often meet people who are\n\npro-Labour and pro-tax 'n' spend to their bootstraps, but who are also\n\nxenophobic, homophobic and reactionary, to the extent that they think you're\n\nweird if you aren't too.\n\n\n\nI look at Michael Gove. I like Michael Gove - we used to be colleagues on this\n\npaper - and while he is lazily caricatured as an old-fashioned Tory, Michael is\n\npalpably concerned that pupils from poor backgrounds are ill-served both by\n\ntheir environment and by the current education system. So he backs a scheme to\n\nremedy this, an inner London academy which wants to set up a state boarding\n\nschool in leafy Sussex.\n\n\n\nGet those Lambeth kids away from the fear - and the temptation - of their own\n\nmean streets, give them a chance of a better life? We can all agree with that,\n\nsurely? No, Gove is being opposed by members of his own party, one of whom - a\n\ncounty councillor - had to resign on Sunday after making blatantly racist\n\nremarks about the intake of the proposed new school.\n\n\n\nOr look at UKIP. UKIP is doing well up and down the country, north and south,\n\ntaking votes from the Tories, yes, but also from Labour. (Except in London.) And\n\nthe truth about the UKIP surge? As a report on a focus group of UKIP voters\n\nreveals, what distinguishes UKIP voters, primarily, is nostalgia. What they want\n\nisn't anything more or less sinister than that Britain go back to what they\n\nimagine it used to be like.\n\n\n\nWe argue about a referendum on our continued membership of the European Union.\n\nThe plebiscite we should be having is whether any of the changes of the past 30,\n\n40, 50 years have been beneficial. That's the clash that needs to happen. I say:\n\nbring it on.\n\n\n\n"

We were given one day's notice that she would visit\n\nfor an hour to see some science in action. As a relatively junior physicist at\n\nthe time, I was selected to show her my experiments on the surface structure of\n\nthermionic cathodes while a biologist colleague demonstrated his X-ray studies\n\nof how muscles work. The Prime Minister seemed thrilled to be surrounded by\n\nyoung scientists, and especially to know that some British research was leading\n\nthe world. We were amazed to be told that every year she asked for her red box\n\nof \"holiday reading\" always to include some recent scientific papers.\n\n\n\nRobert Elphick writes: Baroness Thatcher was renowned for her immaculate\n\nappearance however stressful the event. I met her first in Luxembourg just after\n\nshe had won the Tory party leadership. The 1975 referendum was looming and Mrs\n\nThatcher, as she then was, made her debut on the European stage. As the BBC's\n\nman at the time, I was down to do the TV interview of her first impressions of\n\nmeeting the Members of the European Parliament, all Tories because the Labour\n\nParty was boycotting the institution at the time.\n\n\n\nWe met in a crowded and very noisy room at a buffet lunch. We sat her down in a\n\ncorner and lighted the primitive set. \"This is really important,\" she said in a\n\nsmall almost girlish voice. I reassured her and asked whether she was ready. She\n\nnodded and I began with a few words. She interrupted suddenly. \"Where's the\n\ncamera?\" she asked. I explained that it was that black hole she could see not\n\nfar away under the lights. \"Oh, I cannot be filmed from this side,\" she said.\n\n\"We'll have to start again.\" There was an audible oath from my cameraman who was\n\nusing a limited roll of film, but we re-lighted the whole thing in no time; sat\n\nher round so that her preferred profile was visible and she was word perfect.\n\n\n\nThe Rev Dr Derek Stanesby writes: As a canon of St George's Chapel, Windsor\n\nCastle (1985-1997) I was invited to attend one of the Queen's garden parties at\n\nBuckingham Palace each summer. It was traditional for the Queen, with other\n\nmembers of the Royal Family, to appear on the steps of the Palace and slowly\n\nmake her way through the two lines of loyal and enthusiastic guests that formed\n\naround her.\n\n\n\nOn one of these occasions I noticed a second wave of enthusiastic guests running\n\nparallel to the Queen's procession, greeting what appeared to be another regal\n\nfigure. It was none other than the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, holding\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\nV If you would like to add a personal view or recollection to a published\n\nobituary, you can send your contribution by post to Times Obituaries, 3 Thomas\n\nMore Square, London E98 1TT, or by e-mail to tributes@thetimes.co.uk\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen speculating on what Margaret Thatcher would do if she was in power today,\n\nit is essential to remember that she was a scientist. Not a theoretical\n\nscientist but a real one - a research chemist who was no stranger to the\n\nlaboratory.\n\n\n\nEverything in her politics was underpinned by the scientific method: the\n\nformulation, testing and modification of hypotheses. And when evidence proved\n\nreceived wisdom wrong, Mrs Thatcher was not afraid to change her mind.\n\n\n\nSo it was with her opinion on the Common Market and its evolution into the EU.\n\nJust go to the Thatcher Foundation website and search \"Common Market\": her\n\ndismissal of concerns about the loss of sovereignty in the late 1960s and 1970s\n\nmake her sound like Peter Mandelson today.\n\n\n\nHer belief in the conventional wisdom culminated in that infamous picture of her\n\nwearing her Joseph jumper of many flags, as she campaigned hard for a British\n\n\"Yes\" vote in the 1975 referendum about whether to stay in.\n\n\n\nThe difference between 1975 and now is that the hypothesis that Britain is\n\nbetter off in the EU has been tested to destruction, refuted by bitter\n\nexperience. So what would Mrs Thatcher do about Britain's relationship with the\n\nEU if she was in power now? Her position would be very simple: she would want\n\nout. The workings of the EU made it quite apparent to her that not only was it\n\ngoing down the wrong track, but that it would be unreformable.\n\n\n\nWhen she was in No 10 and began seriously to question the route that the UK had\n\nset and she had followed, the \"Brussels irregulars\" in her own party, as Norman\n\nTebbit has so pithily called them, blocked her. Nonetheless, out of office she\n\nwas president of the Bruges Group, an organisation now dedicated to Britain's\n\nwithdrawal from the EU and her last book, Statecraft (2003), made some sharp\n\nobservations about the dangers of the European project: \"What we should grasp\n\nfrom the lessons of European history is that, first, there is nothing\n\nnecessarily benevolent about programmes of European integration; second, the\n\ndesire to achieve grand utopian plans often poses a grave threat to freedom ...\"\n\nThe UK certainly wouldn't be in this current mess if she were in charge. Not\n\nonly would our negotiations on countless directives small and large have been\n\nvery different, we would never have signed up to the slew of post-Thatcher\n\ntreaties as they stood. Simply put, she would never have allowed it. She, unlike\n\nthe smaller men who have followed her, had the generosity of spirit to believe\n\nthat the people of this country are quite capable of setting their own course.\n\nShe, unlike today's hidebound elite, trusted the British people, their instincts\n\nand their drive. Her whole career was about proving that the man in Whitehall\n\ndoes not know best.\n\n\n\nI was asked last week if UKIP would have been necessary if Mrs Thatcher had not\n\nbeen overthrown before the Maastricht treaty. Had she still been in power in\n\n1992 there would have been a referendum on that treaty, and the need for UKIP\n\nwould probably never have arisen.\n\n\n\nWhat would she do today? She would trust the people and give them a say over the\n\nheads of the Establishment. So she would offer an in/out referendum now - and\n\ncampaign hard for an \"out\" vote - to ascertain the will of the people.\n\n\n\nThere would be two practical options open to her in the event of a vote for\n\nleaving. Either she would ask Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act,\n\nor she would comply with Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union and make\n\nclear the intention of British withdrawal before negotiating the details of\n\nexit. That is, after all, what European law demands - and she understood the\n\nlaw. She would have no truck with the deception being practised by the current\n\nGovernment, in which both consulting the people and the withdrawal option are\n\nafterthoughts.\n\n\n\nMrs Thatcher would follow the logic of what she knew to be true. As another\n\nscientist once said while pointing to the evidence, \"and yet it moves\".\n\n\n\nNigel Farage is the leader of the UK Independence Party\n\n\n\nHad Thatcher stayed, the need for UKIP would not have arisen\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela and David - theirs must be one of the most eye-catching romances of\n\nrecent political history. Seven years ago they were locking horns because the\n\nnewly elected Tory leader had ordered his MEPs to leave the European People's\n\nParty, where all right-minded conservatives are grouped together, Mrs Merkel's\n\nChristian Democrats included, and join a new centre-right group of Cameron's own\n\ncreation.\n\n\n\nIf you could see them now... Over the weekend they celebrated a spring awakening\n\nin each other's company, with Samantha, Joachim and the Cameron children thrown\n\nin for good measure. What a metamorphosis. Never before has the PM taken his\n\nentire family on a foreign trip with so much policy content, nor has Mrs Merkel\n\nawarded such closeness to any other guest, foreign or German, at the German\n\ngovernment's official residence at Schloss Meseberg.\n\n\n\nNow, it may be an axiom of political philosophy that nations don't have friends,\n\nthey have only interests. But it surely helps in this crisis-fraught age if the\n\nprotagonists manage to add friendship to networking and by doing so to reinforce\n\ncommon purposes.\n\n\n\nHeadline-writers tend to overlook what unites people, prefering to go for the\n\ndrama of enmity and rupture of one kind or another. Thus it was with Mr\n\nCameron's EU speech in January that called for powers to be returned to the\n\nnational level. But little notice was taken of what the German Chancellor had\n\nbeen saying that same week at Davos. Mrs Merkel, too, spoke of the need for the\n\nEU to commit to reform to improve competitiveness and to reverse the deep\n\nalienation Europeans feels towards the \"union\", a misnomer if ever there was\n\none.\n\n\n\nOn such issues Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel are as one. Yet even on the vexatious\n\nquestion of the \"competences\" London wants to repatriate from Brussels, the gap\n\nbetween the two leaders is narrowing. The cacophony of abuse that greeted his\n\nspeech has in Germany given way to the murmur of second thoughts making\n\nallegations of British isolation in Europe look misplaced.\n\n\n\nMichael Meister, the deputy parliamentary chairman of Mrs Merkel's governing\n\nparty, was asked at the end of last week what the German Government thought\n\nabout Mr Cameron's much-maligned \"review of competences\" - the result of which\n\nis to determine the in-or-out referendum the Prime Minster has promised to hold\n\nin 2017.\n\n\n\n\"We need compromises,\" the Meister-singer avowed. \"We are open for arguments.\"\n\nSignificantly, he admitted that \"intensive discussions are taking place\" about\n\nthe Prime Minister's ideas. That's exactly what the meeting in Meseberg was\n\nabout.\n\n\n\nWhether a change in existing EU treaties is required, which Mrs Merkel et al are\n\nabsolutely set against, is much too early to tell. More importantly, thanks to\n\nMr Cameron's straight talking, tackling the long-identified \"democracy deficit\"\n\nthat risks wrecking the European project has acquired a new urgency. Setting\n\ndeadlines helps, too, even if David Cameron may himself be politically dead by\n\n2017.\n\n\n\nMrs Merkel certainly has no wish to see her new British friend fall into the\n\nEuropean death trap. The chemistry between them is strongly enhanced by her\n\nstrategic conviction that for the EU to lose Britain but gain Croatia, Bulgaria\n\nor Romania stands logic and good sense on its head.\n\n\n\nBut there is a domestic angle to her calculations as well. If she wants to\n\nmaintain her current popularity right up to the national elections in September\n\nit is good politics to be moving closer to Mr Cameron and his ideas of open\n\nmarkets and democratic accountability, rather than going for the more statist\n\nFrench and their protectionist instincts.\n\n\n\nThere is a secret army of Cameron followers in Germany who applaud his\n\nno-nonsense approach to the EU, which their own politicians rarely dare to\n\napply. Frustration with the onus the bailout arrangements for struggling\n\neurozone countries have placed upon German taxpayers has led to some incendiary\n\npolitical divisions. Mrs Merkel has no desire to kindle further acrimony by\n\npicking a fight with a Prime Minister who is more popular in Germany than the\n\nheadline crafters would allow you to think.\n\n\n\nJust recently Germans have been reminded of how an all-powerful Chancellor,\n\nHelmut Kohl, browbeat them into accepting the euro. \"I acted like a dictator\",\n\nKohl cynically admitted in an interview in 2002 that was released only last\n\nweek.\n\n\n\nOpponents he branded as virtual \"enemies of the state\" in the late 1990s have\n\nnow formed a new party, Alternative for Germany, to kickstart a belated\n\ndiscussion about what a return to the deutschmark might mean for Germany's\n\nfuture.\n\n\n\nThe new party has to register at least 2,000 signatures in every one of\n\nGermany's 16 federal states to be allowed to run in the national elections. Some\n\n25 per cent of voters, according to a recent poll, have said that they might opt\n\nfor the Alternative come September. But only 5,000 of them have so far actually\n\nsigned up.\n\n\n\nIt is \"the dread of something after death, / The undiscovered country from whose\n\nbourn /No traveller returns\" that puzzles the will of Germany's sceptical voters\n\nas they contemplate life after the demise of the euro. At the same time they\n\ndeeply mistrust politicians, remembering how Mr Kohl coerced them into giving up\n\nthe deutschmark.\n\n\n\nBy contrast David Cameron, with his direct and open manner, is a leader after\n\nthe Germans' and Angela Merkel's own hearts. May their romance withstand the\n\nslings and arrows of outrageous times.\n\n\n\nThomas Kielinger is the UK correspondent of Die Welt and author of Elizabeth II:\n\nDas Leben der Queen\n\n\n\nThere is a secret army of Cameron followers in Germany\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nUKIP would not exist if Margaret Thatcher had survived the Tory leadership\n\ncontest of 1990, Nigel Farage has claimed.\n\n\n\nIn an article for The Times today, the UKIP leader argues that she would not\n\nhave allowed Britain to sign the Maastrict Treaty, which created the European\n\nUnion two years after she left office.\n\n\n\n\"Had Mrs Thatcher still been in power in 1992 there would have been a referendum\n\non that treaty, and the need for UKIP would probably have never arisen,\" he\n\nwrites.\n\n\n\nHis comments come amid increasing concern from Conservatives that the party is\n\nout of touch with voters who consistently supported it during the Thatcher\n\nyears.\n\n\n\nIn other developments yesterday, it emerged that: ? Marco Pierre White, the\n\ncelebrity chef, Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, and senior generals will be\n\namong the guests at Baroness Thatcher's funeral on Wednesday. ? The Bishop of\n\nGrantham, her home town, criticised the scale of the event, describing it as\n\n\"asking for trouble\". ? A Â£15 million Conservative training institute to\n\npreserve the Thatcher legacy could be housed in the former Liberal Democrat\n\nParty headquarters in Westminster.\n\n\n\nMr Farage says that it is \"completely impossible, given her vehement opposition\n\nto that [Maastricht] treaty, that there would not have been a UK referendum at\n\nthat time\". There is no doubt that she would have \"carried the country\" in such\n\na vote.\n\n\n\nHe believes that Lady Thatcher would \"want out\" of the European Union, despite\n\nhaving backed a 'yes' vote on membership of the Common Market in 1975. \"The\n\ndifference between 1975 and now is that the hypothesis that Britain is better\n\noff in the EU Continued on page 7, col 4\n\n\n\nContinued from page 1 has been tested to destruction, and has been refuted by\n\nbitter experience.\"\n\n\n\nMr Farage would not describe his party as the \"heir to Thatcher\" but says that\n\nthe \"type of people\" who supported her are attracted to UKIP.\n\n\n\nThe party secured its best by-election result in Eastleigh in February with 27.8\n\nper cent of the vote. It has reached 17 per cent in national polls and attracted\n\nsupport from several members of the Tories' Â£50,000-a-year donor club.\n\n\n\nTory backbenchers are increasingly concerned that David Cameron is failing to\n\nappreciate the scale of the UKIP threat.

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen speculating on what Margaret Thatcher would do if she was in power today,\n\nit is essential to remember that she was a scientist. Not a theoretical\n\nscientist but a real one - a research chemist who was no stranger to the\n\nlaboratory.\n\n\n\nEverything in her politics was underpinned by the scientific method: the\n\nformulation, testing and modification of hypotheses. And when evidence proved\n\nreceived wisdom wrong, Mrs Thatcher was not afraid to change her mind.\n\n\n\nSo it was with her opinion on the Common Market and its evolution into the EU.\n\nJust go to the Thatcher Foundation website and search \"Common Market\": her\n\ndismissal of concerns about the loss of sovereignty in the late 1960s and 1970s\n\nmake her sound like Peter Mandelson today.\n\n\n\nHer belief in the conventional wisdom culminated in that infamous picture of her\n\nwearing her Joseph jumper of many flags, as she campaigned hard for a British\n\n\"Yes\" vote in the 1975 referendum about whether to stay in.\n\n\n\nThe difference between 1975 and now is that the hypothesis that Britain is\n\nbetter off in the EU has been tested to destruction, refuted by bitter\n\nexperience. So what would Mrs Thatcher do about Britain's relationship with the\n\nEU if she was in power now? Her position would be very simple: she would want\n\nout. The workings of the EU made it quite apparent to her that not only was it\n\ngoing down the wrong track, but that it would be unreformable.\n\n\n\nWhen she was in No 10 and began seriously to question the route that the UK had\n\nset and she had followed, the \"Brussels irregulars\" in her own party, as Norman\n\nTebbit has so pithily called them, blocked her. Nonetheless, out of office she\n\nwas president of the Bruges Group, an organisation now dedicated to Britain's\n\nwithdrawal from the EU and her last book, Statecraft (2003), made some sharp\n\nobservations about the dangers of the European project: \"What we should grasp\n\nfrom the lessons of European history is that, first, there is nothing\n\nnecessarily benevolent about programmes of European integration; second, the\n\ndesire to achieve grand utopian plans often poses a grave threat to freedom ...\"\n\nThe UK certainly wouldn't be in this current mess if she were in charge. Not\n\nonly would our negotiations on countless directives small and large have been\n\nvery different, we would never have signed up to the slew of post-Thatcher\n\ntreaties as they stood. Simply put, she would never have allowed it. She, unlike\n\nthe smaller men who have followed her, had the generosity of spirit to believe\n\nthat the people of this country are quite capable of setting their own course.\n\nShe, unlike today's hidebound elite, trusted the British people, their instincts\n\nand their drive. Her whole career was about proving that the man in Whitehall\n\ndoes not know best.\n\n\n\nI was asked last week if UKIP would have been necessary if Mrs Thatcher had not\n\nbeen overthrown before the Maastricht treaty. Had she still been in power in\n\n1992 there would have been a referendum on that treaty, and the need for UKIP\n\nwould probably never have arisen.\n\n\n\nWhat would she do today? She would trust the people and give them a say over the\n\nheads of the Establishment. So she would offer an in/out referendum now - and\n\ncampaign hard for an \"out\" vote - to ascertain the will of the people.\n\n\n\nThere would be two practical options open to her in the event of a vote for\n\nleaving. Either she would ask Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act,\n\nor she would comply with Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union and make\n\nclear the intention of British withdrawal before negotiating the details of\n\nexit. That is, after all, what European law demands - and she understood the\n\nlaw. She would have no truck with the deception being practised by the current\n\nGovernment, in which both consulting the people and the withdrawal option are\n\nafterthoughts.\n\n\n\nMrs Thatcher would follow the logic of what she knew to be true. As another\n\nscientist once said while pointing to the evidence, \"and yet it moves\".\n\n\n\nNigel Farage is the leader of the UK Independence Party\n\n\n\nHad Thatcher stayed, the need for UKIP would not have arisen\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela and David - theirs must be one of the most eye-catching romances of\n\nrecent political history. Seven years ago they were locking horns because the\n\nnewly elected Tory leader had ordered his MEPs to leave the European People's\n\nParty, where all right-minded conservatives are grouped together, Mrs Merkel's\n\nChristian Democrats included, and join a new centre-right group of Cameron's own\n\ncreation.\n\n\n\nIf you could see them now... Over the weekend they celebrated a spring awakening\n\nin each other's company, with Samantha, Joachim and the Cameron children thrown\n\nin for good measure. What a metamorphosis. Never before has the PM taken his\n\nentire family on a foreign trip with so much policy content, nor has Mrs Merkel\n\nawarded such closeness to any other guest, foreign or German, at the German\n\ngovernment's official residence at Schloss Meseberg.\n\n\n\nNow, it may be an axiom of political philosophy that nations don't have friends,\n\nthey have only interests. But it surely helps in this crisis-fraught age if the\n\nprotagonists manage to add friendship to networking and by doing so to reinforce\n\ncommon purposes.\n\n\n\nHeadline-writers tend to overlook what unites people, prefering to go for the\n\ndrama of enmity and rupture of one kind or another. Thus it was with Mr\n\nCameron's EU speech in January that called for powers to be returned to the\n\nnational level. But little notice was taken of what the German Chancellor had\n\nbeen saying that same week at Davos. Mrs Merkel, too, spoke of the need for the\n\nEU to commit to reform to improve competitiveness and to reverse the deep\n\nalienation Europeans feels towards the \"union\", a misnomer if ever there was\n\none.\n\n\n\nOn such issues Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel are as one. Yet even on the vexatious\n\nquestion of the \"competences\" London wants to repatriate from Brussels, the gap\n\nbetween the two leaders is narrowing. The cacophony of abuse that greeted his\n\nspeech has in Germany given way to the murmur of second thoughts making\n\nallegations of British isolation in Europe look misplaced.\n\n\n\nMichael Meister, the deputy parliamentary chairman of Mrs Merkel's governing\n\nparty, was asked at the end of last week what the German Government thought\n\nabout Mr Cameron's much-maligned \"review of competences\" - the result of which\n\nis to determine the in-or-out referendum the Prime Minster has promised to hold\n\nin 2017.\n\n\n\n\"We need compromises,\" the Meister-singer avowed. \"We are open for arguments.\"\n\nSignificantly, he admitted that \"intensive discussions are taking place\" about\n\nthe Prime Minister's ideas. That's exactly what the meeting in Meseberg was\n\nabout.\n\n\n\nWhether a change in existing EU treaties is required, which Mrs Merkel et al are\n\nabsolutely set against, is much too early to tell. More importantly, thanks to\n\nMr Cameron's straight talking, tackling the long-identified \"democracy deficit\"\n\nthat risks wrecking the European project has acquired a new urgency. Setting\n\ndeadlines helps, too, even if David Cameron may himself be politically dead by\n\n2017.\n\n\n\nMrs Merkel certainly has no wish to see her new British friend fall into the\n\nEuropean death trap. The chemistry between them is strongly enhanced by her\n\nstrategic conviction that for the EU to lose Britain but gain Croatia, Bulgaria\n\nor Romania stands logic and good sense on its head.\n\n\n\nBut there is a domestic angle to her calculations as well. If she wants to\n\nmaintain her current popularity right up to the national elections in September\n\nit is good politics to be moving closer to Mr Cameron and his ideas of open\n\nmarkets and democratic accountability, rather than going for the more statist\n\nFrench and their protectionist instincts.\n\n\n\nThere is a secret army of Cameron followers in Germany who applaud his\n\nno-nonsense approach to the EU, which their own politicians rarely dare to\n\napply. Frustration with the onus the bailout arrangements for struggling\n\neurozone countries have placed upon German taxpayers has led to some incendiary\n\npolitical divisions. Mrs Merkel has no desire to kindle further acrimony by\n\npicking a fight with a Prime Minister who is more popular in Germany than the\n\nheadline crafters would allow you to think.\n\n\n\nJust recently Germans have been reminded of how an all-powerful Chancellor,\n\nHelmut Kohl, browbeat them into accepting the euro. \"I acted like a dictator\",\n\nKohl cynically admitted in an interview in 2002 that was released only last\n\nweek.\n\n\n\nOpponents he branded as virtual \"enemies of the state\" in the late 1990s have\n\nnow formed a new party, Alternative for Germany, to kickstart a belated\n\ndiscussion about what a return to the deutschmark might mean for Germany's\n\nfuture.\n\n\n\nThe new party has to register at least 2,000 signatures in every one of\n\nGermany's 16 federal states to be allowed to run in the national elections. Some\n\n25 per cent of voters, according to a recent poll, have said that they might opt\n\nfor the Alternative come September. But only 5,000 of them have so far actually\n\nsigned up.\n\n\n\nIt is \"the dread of something after death, / The undiscovered country from whose\n\nbourn /No traveller returns\" that puzzles the will of Germany's sceptical voters\n\nas they contemplate life after the demise of the euro. At the same time they\n\ndeeply mistrust politicians, remembering how Mr Kohl coerced them into giving up\n\nthe deutschmark.\n\n\n\nBy contrast David Cameron, with his direct and open manner, is a leader after\n\nthe Germans' and Angela Merkel's own hearts. May their romance withstand the\n\nslings and arrows of outrageous times.\n\n\n\nThomas Kielinger is the UK correspondent of Die Welt and author of Elizabeth II:\n\nDas Leben der Queen\n\n\n\nThere is a secret army of Cameron followers in Germany\n\n\n\n"

We were given one day's notice that she would visit\n\nfor an hour to see some science in action. As a relatively junior physicist at\n\nthe time, I was selected to show her my experiments on the surface structure of\n\nthermionic cathodes while a biologist colleague demonstrated his X-ray studies\n\nof how muscles work. The Prime Minister seemed thrilled to be surrounded by\n\nyoung scientists, and especially to  that some British research was leading the\n\nworld. We were amazed to be told that every year she asked for her red box of\n\n\"holiday reading\" always to include some recent scientific papers.\n\n\n\nRobert Elphick writes: Baroness Thatcher was renowned for her immaculate\n\nappearance however stressful the event. I met her first in Luxembourg just after\n\nshe had won the Tory party leadership. The 1975 referendum was looming and Mrs\n\nThatcher, as she then was, made her debut on the European stage. As the BBC's\n\nman at the time, I was down to do the TV interview of her first impressions of\n\nmeeting the Members of the European Parliament, all Tories because the Labour\n\nParty was boycotting the institution at the time.\n\n\n\nWe met in a crowded and very noisy room at a buffet lunch. We sat her down in a\n\ncorner and lighted the primitive set. \"This is really important,\" she said in a\n\nsmall almost girlish voice. I reassured her and asked whether she was ready. She\n\nnodded and I began with a few words. She interrupted suddenly. \"Where's the\n\ncamera?\" she asked. I explained that it was that black hole she could see not\n\nfar away under the lights. \"Oh, I cannot be filmed from this side,\" she said.\n\n\"We'll have to start again.\" There was an audible oath from my cameraman who was\n\nusing a limited roll of film, but we re-lighted the whole thing in no time; sat\n\nher round so that her preferred profile was visible and she was word perfect.\n\n\n\nThe Rev Dr Derek Stanesby writes: As a canon of St George's Chapel, Windsor\n\nCastle (1985-1997) I was invited to attend one of the Queen's garden parties at\n\nBuckingham Palace each summer. It was traditional for the Queen, with other\n\nmembers of the Royal Family, to appear on the steps of the Palace and slowly\n\nmake her way through the two lines of loyal and enthusiastic guests that formed\n\naround her.\n\n\n\nOn one of these occasions I noticed a second wave of enthusiastic guests running\n\nparallel to the Queen's procession, greeting what appeared to be another regal\n\nfigure. It was none other than the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, holding\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\nIf you would like to add a personal view or recollection to a published\n\nobituary, you can send your contribution by post to Times Obituaries, 3 Thomas\n\nMore Square, London E98 1TT, or by e-mail to tributes@thetimes.co.uk\n\n\n\n"

Marco Pierre White, the\n\ncelebrity chef, Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, and senior generals will be\n\namong the guests at Baroness Thatcher's funeral on Wednesday. ? The Bishop of\n\nGrantham, her home town, criticised the scale of the event, describing it as\n\n\"asking for trouble\". ? A Â£15 million Conservative training institute to\n\npreserve the Thatcher legacy could be housed in the former Liberal Democrat\n\nParty headquarters in Westminster.\n\n\n\nMr Farage says that it is \"completely impossible, given her vehement opposition\n\nto that [Maastricht] treaty, that there would not have been a UK referendum at\n\nthat time\". There is no doubt that she would have \"carried the country\" in such\n\na vote.\n\n\n\nHe believes that Lady Thatcher would \"want out\" of the European Union, despite\n\nhaving backed a 'yes' vote on membership of the Common Market in 1975. \"The\n\ndifference between 1975 and now is that the hypothesis that Britain is better\n\noff in the EU Continued on page 7, col 4\n\n\n\nContinued from page 1 has been tested to destruction, and has been refuted by\n\nbitter experience.\"\n\n\n\nMr Farage would not describe his party as the \"heir to Thatcher\" but says that\n\nthe \"type of people\" who supported her are attracted to UKIP.\n\n\n\nThe party secured its best by-election result in Eastleigh in February with 27.8\n\nper cent of the vote.
