Irish premier Enda Kenny has insisted that the Republic's corporation tax regime

is under no threat from German coalition talks, even though Angela Merkel's

potential coalition partners want the Republic's 12.5% rate put back on the EU

negotiating table.



He said: "It's very straightforward, it's a matter of national competence and is

not an issue." Pressed on whether Merkel could give him that assurance, Kenny

said: "The EU treaties have been adopted by a decison by the European Council,

by referendum. It is for each country to make its own decision."



Kenny said the government had restored Ireland's international reputation among

investors and the economy was still generating 3,000 new jobs a month. On

corporations using Ireland to pay little or no corporation tax, such as Google

and Apple, he added: "It requires an international response and we are at the

forefront of the European Council in saying there should be an international

response."
