Labour is to abstain on the private member's bill introducing a referendum on

Britain's membership of the European Union by 2017.



The bill sponsored by James Wharton, Tory MP for Stockton South, is due to have

its second reading on 5 July. The Labour decision was denounced as weak by the

Tory chairman, Grant Shapps.



Wharton has said he thinks his bill has a 50-50 chance of getting onto the

statute book, but the Labour abstention will help the bill get through to its

next stage of detailed examination in committee. Labour is divided on its

long-term referendum stance but says it is committed to a plebiscite if there is

a further significant proposed transfer of powers to Brussels. The shadow

chancellor, Ed Balls, has warned Labour not to end up as the anti-referendum

party. Only 15 or so Labour MPs openly support an in-out referendum.



David Cameron has said he wants a referendum to be held after negotiating a

potential new relationship with the EU. He has told Conservative MPs to attend

the vote on 5 July, even though it is a private member's bill.



The Tories accused Labour of denying voters a say over whether Britain should

quit the EU. Shapps said: "We want to allow the British people to decide our

European future with an in-out referendum and we want to turn this commitment

into law. Ed Miliband has made clear yet again that he is too weak to give his

MPs, let alone the public, a say."
