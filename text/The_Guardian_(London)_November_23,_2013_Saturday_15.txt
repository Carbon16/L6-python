David Cameron has seen off an attempt by Tory rebels to force a referendum on

Britain's European Union membership before the next election.



Conservative MPs voted overwhelmingly against a proposal to bring forward the

date of a referendum tabled by Adam Afriyie - a backbencher said to be keen to

oust Cameron as Tory leader.



The Commons voted yesterday by 249 votes to 15 against Afriyie's amendment to

the European Union (referendum) bill, which is backed by the Tory leadership and

states there will be a poll before the end of 2017.



The Conservative leadership successfully argued that a referendum must be held

after attempts to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels, which could

take several years.



Afriyie, the MP for Windsor, insisted he was right to press ahead. By putting

the 2014 option before parliament, I was reflecting the opinion of the vast

majority of the British people," he said.
