Lord Dobbs of Wylye, the man who wrote the political thriller House of Cards, is

to introduce the Conservative bill pledging an EU referendum into the House of

Lords. The peer and novelist will attempt to win support for the bill in the

upper chamber, where it may run into trouble as it is opposed by both Labour and

the Liberal Democrats.



The EU referendum bill, promising a poll before 2018, is a Tory-backed bill

rather than a government one, as Nick Clegg does not support it. This means it

has to be sponsored by backbenchers, with 29-year-old James Wharton, MP for

Stockton South, taking it through the Commons over the last few Fridays.



The legislation is heading to the Lords after it cleared its third Commons

reading unopposed. Many opposition MPs, such as Labour's Mike Gapes, gave long

and irrelevant speeches in a bid to make it run out of parliamentary time, but

it eventually passed without a vote.



Wharton accused Labour and the Liberal Democrats of having done "absolutely

everything in their power" to frustrate the bill in the Commons, and warned

peers not to try similar tactics.



Dobbs said: "I am delighted to be introducing this bill into the House of Lords.

This is the first time for a generation that the public will be given the

opportunity to have their say on membership of the EU."
