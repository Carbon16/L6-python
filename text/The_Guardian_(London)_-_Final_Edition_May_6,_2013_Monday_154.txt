William Hague was at loggerheads with old allies on the Tory right last night

after he rejected calls for a change in tactics by Downing Street as a response

to the new threat posed by the United Kingdom Independence party.



As the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, warned that his party would trigger a

political "earthquake" in next year's European parliamentary elections, the

foreign secretary dismissed calls for an immediate EU referendum and said there

were no "quick fixes".



There were suggestions last night that Downing Street may try to reach out to

disaffected Tory voters, who have complained about plans to legalise gay

marriage, by omitting any reference to the equal marriage bill in this week's

Queen's speech.



The Liberal Democrats say the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill will not and

cannot be dropped.



But one leading figure on the right accused Hague of failing to understand the

depth of the threat posed by Ukip whose success is not a "flash in the pan". The

senior MP said: "William Hague is once again proving that he is always wrong on

strategy."



Farage stoked Tory tensions by saying that he would be open to talks if the

party removed Cameron as prime minister.



The Ukip leader told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: "If David Cameron gets

removed . . . and somebody else was put in place who wanted to come and talk to

us and say, 'Shall we find an accommodation?' we would consider it. But it is

not my priority."



David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, called on Cameron to speed up the

process of a vote on the EU by holding a "mandate" referendum.



But Hague said it was not possible to introduce a government bill, although he

held out the possibility of the Tory leadership supporting a backbench bill.
