* In his otherwise excellent article on al-Qaida (The war on fear, 29 January),

I fear that Jason Burke gives David Cameron the benefit of too much doubt when

he refers to his comments simply as "dated". Cameron knows exactly what he is

doing. As a consummate PR man, he is appealing to the fear of the Other in a bid

to try to ensure he is re-elected in 2015. He is doing the same in relation to

the in-out EU referendum. As George Monbiot (Comment, 29 January) suggests,

Cameron thinks he has a divine right to govern but even he realises he must win

the next election first.



Articles in the same edition on the destruction of manuscripts and Sufi shrines

in Mali (and even the obituary of Stanley Cohen) show why such issues are

important and why appeals to xenophobia for short-term political expediency must

not pass unchallenged.
