In 2008 you published two letters from Malyn Newitt (25 January and 16 June),

which strongly made the point that simplistic referendums undermine

parliamentary democracy. He was referring to an Irish referendum, but the same

applies to the PM's proposal (Cameron to pledge in-out vote on EU, 23 January).

For a start, a decision which will influence the country for decades or longer

may be made with little real knowledge of the issues involved and that knowledge

may be influenced by who has the bigger campaigning budget. The press barons may

well decide our national future.



One can also easily imagine that some emotive but not very important EU decision

might sway the No camp and, as Professor Newitt wrote, referendums become

definitive and the matter is unlikely to be revisited for a very long time.

Whatever Eurosceptics may say, it seems that their main objection is to EU

legislation on labour and social issues. Under the guise of suggesting that

greater freedom for employers to weaken workers' rights will be better for the

economy, they are, of course, seeking to increase the advance of US-style

capitalism, rather than the more humane version of many of our European

neighbours. For better or worse, we elect politicians to make decisions on our

behalf. We should tell them what we think, but the decision should be that of

parliament.
