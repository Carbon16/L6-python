Goldman Sachs has said it would move much of its European business out of London

if Britain leaves the European Union.



The warning from the world's most powerful investment bank comes as political

pressure for Britain to leave the EU mounts. David Cameron has committed to

holding a referendum on Britain's membership if the Conservatives win the next

election and some Tory MPs have been agitating for an early vote on the matter.



Michael Sherwood, co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs International, said: "In

all likelihood we would transfer a substantial part of our European business

from London to a eurozone location - the most obvious contenders being Paris and

Frankfurt."



The City of London became the hub for international financial companies as they

went global in the late 1980s. The financial sector is supported by a large

network of law firms, accountants and other support services that employ

millions.



International banks such as Goldman and Morgan Stanley employ thousands in

Britain working on projects and trading assets across Europe. Goldman employs

6,000 of its 7,000 European staff in the UK.



Liberal Democrat MEP Sharon Bowles said Sherwood's comments to Germany's

Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung showed there would be big job losses in Britain's

financial sector if the UK left the EU."



Goldman has argued that Britain needs to stay in the EU for London to maintain

its position as the continent's financial centre. It has said that any shift

would be gradual but inevitable.



The City of London Corporation has said leaving the EU is a constant worry for

financial institutions based in London. A recent CBI poll found that nearly 80%

of UK businesses supported membership.
