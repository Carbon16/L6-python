The froth of a referendum will dominate the headlines, but the details of the

PM's speech deserve proper scrutiny even though tweeters may dismiss them as

boring or difficult. We should welcome that he remembered that the founding

principle of the EU is about peace and the wellbeing of its citizens, not just

markets. They are a mechanism, not an end. He is right that some co-operation

and networking can be better than all the complex institutions: we could lose

the economic and social committee and barely notice it, for example.



But the analysis is full of holes: in one breath he wants to complete the single

EU market so that online consumers can have the same rights; in the next he

wants us all to be very different as producers, to pick and choose which bits of

that single market we want to call fair or unfair. The single market reduces 27

or more loads of national red tape and it enshrines rights and freedoms for

people to work, study, trade and earn in ways that would not exist without

supporting courts and mechanisms.



All who support wellbeing must speak up for the much-maligned working-time

directive. Cameron uses it as an example of all that is wrong. In fact it is

potentially one of the finest pieces of legislation ever passed, offering rights

for people to not be wage slaves, to have breaks and holidays. When graduates

are told to opt out of its provisions or not get a post, we should urge its

strengthening, not removal. Also, those who back the EU but want to change it

progressively should stop talking of it as a "project". It is not a study,

political game or theory: this is a real struggle about real lives and rights as

well as international responsibilities.
