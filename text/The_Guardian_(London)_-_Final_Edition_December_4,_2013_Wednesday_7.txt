The Guardian (Report, 30 November) may regard issues such as the eligible

electorate, the timing, rules or the proposed question of any EU referendum as

"irrelevant". Those of us committed to a fair process, parliamentary democracy

and proper scrutiny of legislation do not. Nor do many of the more than one

million British citizens living elsewhere in the EU, or the EU citizens living

and working here who will be disenfranchised by this very bad bill. That is why

I put forward a series of amendments, 36 of which were selected for debate by

the Speaker. I hope that this inadequate, flawed and partisan Tory bill will now

be subjected to detailed scrutiny and significant amendment by the House of

Lords.
