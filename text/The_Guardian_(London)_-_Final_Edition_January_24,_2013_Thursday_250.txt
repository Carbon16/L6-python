The PM has followed his instincts: both to do what he thinks is in the best

interests of his party and to find a unique selling point for remaining in power

beyond 2015. There is always a whiff of a good wheeze whenever big

constitutional issues are put forward by his government. We must hope that he

has thought of collateral impacts - for instance on devolution arguments. And,

first off, "attitude" to the EU may now be a more significant factor in the

Scottish referendum.
