Greeks who have the means may be leaving in droves, but after 46 years in exile

the former king, Constantine II, has moved back to his crisis-plagued homeland.



The deposed monarch, who was forced to flee Athens shortly after the seizure of

power by a group of army officers in 1967, has stunned Greeks - and most of his

relatives in the royal households of Europe - by resettling in the capital where

he was born. "He and Anne-Marie have decided to move here permanently," said a

member of Greece's small circle of royalists, referring to Constantine's Danish

wife.



Soaring property prices in London apparently spurred the move. But Constantine,

who was dethroned by referendum on the return of democracy in 1974 and stripped

of his Greek citizenship by the then socialist government 20 years later, is

known to have been homesick.



The 73-year-old, a first cousin of the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince William's

godfather, had his palaces and other royal estates expropriated in 1994. The

European court of human rights ruled that the Greek state compensate Constantine

for a fraction of the Â£320m he had sought.



Earlier this year, however, Constantine struck lucky when he sold his north

London mansion for Â£9.5m. By contrast, property prices in Athens have plummeted

to the point where flats are selling for as little as euros 6,000 (Â£5,000) in

the city centre.



The former monarch has repeatedly denied political ambitions.
