Turkey's prime minister is behaving like an elected dictator and inciting a

constitutional crisis in a bid for greater personal power, the leader of the

country's main opposition party has warned.



Kemal Kilicdaroglu, chairman of the social democratic Republican People's party

(CHP), said Recep Tayyip Erdogan, premier since 2003, was determined to change

the constitution to create an executive presidency, to which post he would

switch after elections due next year.



"Turkey needs a new constitution to protect individual rights," Kilicdaroglu

said. The 1982 charter was out of date and at odds with Turkey's EU ambitions,

he said, but Erdogan's plans ignored the need for a separation of powers, for

instance by allowing the president to appoint judges.



"The prime minister is more and more authoritarian, unfortunately," Kilicdaroglu

said. "The sovereignty of fear is ubiquitous. No one can talk with ease on the

telephone . . . the media are fearful.



"There is not one single dissenting voice within his own party. The attempt to

create an executive presidency is all about the concentration of power in a

single hand. It will be a disaster for Turkey."



The constitutional row is expected to come to a head next month, after Erdogan's

ruling party indicated it would impose a guillotine on debate in the

constitutional commission by the end of March.



If agreement is lacking, the government needs the backing of at least four

opposition MPs to push through the new charter and send it for ratification in a

referendum, which it is confident it would win.



Kilicdaroglu was interviewed during a meeting at the House of Commons sponsored

by Keith Vaz MP and chaired by Jo Glanville of English PEN, which promotes and

defends freedom of expression.
