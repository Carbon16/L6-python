By the lucky dip of a ballot, James Wharton, MP for Stockton South, was chosen

to table the Tory party-devised bill to guarantee an in-out referendum by 2017,

and thus became the poster boy of the Tory Eurosceptics.



At 29, Wharton is the youngest Tory MP. When he took his seat in 2010, he had a

majority of just 332 over Labour. A self-proclaimed Eurosceptic, he was one of

53 Tories who voted against the government to call for a cut in the EU budget.

He once questioned whether too much time was spent debating Europe, saying most

people didn't connect with the debate.



Yesterday he was hoping the bill would lay the issue to rest. "What I hope is

that once we have brought this forward and MPs of all political colours will get

a chance to vote on it in parliament, hopefully, it will become legislation, but

we will see," he told The World at One.
