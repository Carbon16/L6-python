Talk of a referendum and putting the UK's membership of the EU in question would

be a mistake at this time (Comment, 22 January). When the eurozone and the EU as

a whole are making significant efforts to reform and the world economy is facing

unprecedented challenges, suggestions that the UK could leave the EU are

unrealistic and will only cause further instability and uncertainty for

businesses, investors and households in Britain. Global investors, our

international partners and our fellow EU member states want the UK to be

involved at the core of the biggest common market in the world, with a seat

around the table to influence decisions that determine the future wellbeing of

the European economy, of which the UK is a part. Casting doubt on the UK's

future membership while reforms continue will weaken our hand in influencing

those reforms before anyone knows what the benefits and responsibilities of

future membership might be.



The role of political parties is to engage the British people in a continuous

discussion, not least during local, national and European elections, about what

membership of the EU means for the UK. It is our job to address their concerns

and explain the rights and responsibilities, the numerous benefits and

inevitable costs that come with being part of a community of 27 sovereign

nations that have come together in pursuit of their common interests. We should

focus our efforts on doing exactly that.

Bill Newton-Dunn MEP, Ben Bradshaw MP, Chris Huhne MP, Lord Dykes, Baroness

Warnock, Glenis Willmott MEP and 50 others
