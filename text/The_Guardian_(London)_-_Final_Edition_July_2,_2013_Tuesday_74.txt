Tory supporters of an EU referendum need to broaden their cross-party support

and show great discipline if the bill introducing an in-out referendum by 2017

is to reach the statute book, the bill's sponsor declared yesterday.



Conservative MP James Wharton said the bill's second reading on Friday would be

straightforward because of Labour and Liberal Democrat abstentions, but he added

that "in the longer run, we do need a broader base of support".



In a message to the ardent Eurosceptics on his own benches, Wharton, MP for

Stockton South on Teesside, said he needed to make sure no amendments were

tabled if the bill was to reach the Lords by the late autumn. He said: "The best

chance of it going through is if it is unamended, so I discourage colleagues

from all sides from tabling amendments."



John Mills, the founder of the Labour campaign for a referendum, claimed half of

the shadow cabinet and at least a third of all Labour MPs now privately

supported Labour backing a referendum at the next election. Labour is abstaining

on the bill's second reading, but Mills believes that if David Cameron were less

eager to exploit Labour's opposition to an in-out referendum, the party's

leader, Ed Miliband, might be persuaded to shift his stance.



But Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, insisted his party

had remained consistent in saying it did not support a referendum. Whenever a

referendum came, he said, his party would be backing Britain remaining in the

EU.



He said: "The Liberal Democrats have been consistent throughout; the

Conservatives have changed. They now want to pluck a slightly arbitrary date in

the diary out of thin air to have a referendum on a very ill-defined process of

so-called renegotiation.



"We have a clear position. We are not going to waste . . . time helping the

Conservatives indulge in their own internal feuds in the Commons on Friday."
