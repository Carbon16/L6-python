The United Kingdom Independence party will trigger a political "earthquake" in

next year's European parliamentary elections, its leader, Nigel Farage, said

yesterday.



Amid growing calls from Tory MPs for David Cameron to respond to the Ukip threat

by bringing forward legislation on an EU referendum, Farage warned that his

party would not go away even if No 10 "starts singing the same song".



William Hague, who famously suffered a major defeat in the 2001 election after

tacking to the right, called for a cautious response to Ukip as he warned of the

dangers of "quick fixes".



Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, said many Ukip voters were "frustrated

Conservatives".



As the Tories work out their response to Ukip, which won nearly a quarter of the

vote in wards it contested in the local elections, Farage said he would not be

standing in any byelection over the next year as he focuses on the European

parliamentary elections.



The Ukip leader told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: "Ukip is here to stay . . .

June 2014 we have a European election. That is the day on which Ukip can cause

an earthquake in British politics. I want to lead the party into that."



Asked whether he would stand for parliament in the 2015 general election, Farage

said: "Yes I will stand for a seat in 2015. I have been rather busy for the last

few weeks doing other things (to decide which seat to contest). But I will think

about it."



Farage pointed out that Ukip was picking up votes not just from the Tories. He

added: "Please don't think that Ukip is just some little pressure group that

will go away because somebody in Downing Street starts singing the same song."
