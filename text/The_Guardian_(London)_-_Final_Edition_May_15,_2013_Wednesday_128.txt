*Why a referendum on the EU, but not on reform of the the NHS, privatisation of

Royal Mail, or much else that is just as influential on everyday life? When

there are many such issues where public opinion is hazy, ill-informed and

overemotional, why is it only the one which has the favour of the political

right that get pushed by press hysteria into being the subject of a referendum?
