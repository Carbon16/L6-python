Your report on the latest spat within the Conservative party over the EU

referendum (Cabinet crisis for Cameron as ministers break ranks over EU, 13 May)

raises an interesting question about what the Tories' real agenda is. Big

business and the City, the latter now largely owned by US investment banks which

view the UK as an important bridgehead into Europe, clearly want to retain

access to the single market - but without the employment, health and safety and

welfare protections negotiated by the labour movement. This suggests that much

of the Tory dissension is disingenuous posturing, designed to negotiate

repatriation of powers in these areas and take the sting out of the Ukip threat,

or represents "Little Englander" attempts to replace control of our economy by

international monopoly capital with that of British monopoly capital.



But this shouldn't obscure the progressive argument for leaving the EU. The EU

stability and growth pact outlaws Keynesian-style reflationary policies.

Competition policy prevents state aid to strategic industries. The EU services

directive forces privatisation of what remains of the public sector. And

European court of justice rulings undermine collective bargaining and wage

levels. Social Europe is a con. The left needs to make the case for an

alternative, progressive future outside the EU - where we have the right to

self-determination, can rebalance the economy away from finance towards

manufacturing and can construct a society on democratic, socialist terms.
