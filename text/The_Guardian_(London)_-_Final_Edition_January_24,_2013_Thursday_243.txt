Hokey-cokey politics:



Can't shake the sense that there's something silly about the referendum on the

EU? You're right. It will be "in-out", according to David Cameron. Just like the

hokey-kokey.



Too drunk to drive:



A new breathylser has been devised to wire to ignitions, so your car won't start

if you're over the limit. Great idea! But doesn't someone now need to invent a

way to get the car home if you fail the test?



Bend it like Brooklyn:



Brooklyn Beckham has been training at Chelsea. This is exciting. David hasn't

even retired and already there's another one. In fact, there will probably be a

lifetime of Beckhams.



Plant:



Local government officials have the right to enter your home to check pot plants

for pests. Fight back: organise with neighbours to take all your pot plants to

them. That'll teach them.



So long, Katie?:



Here's some really ageing news: it has been announced that a special Katie Melua

concert will be held at the Roundhouse in Camden this year. Why? To celebrate

the 10th anniversary of her recording career.
