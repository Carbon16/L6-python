* Timothy Garton Ash and his ilk call it the EU accord on the free movement of

peoples (From outside, it's clear Britain has to stay in Europe, 24 January).

For many others it's nothing less than mass immigration. The problem is a living

wage and mass immigration are mutually exclusive. Either curtail immigration, in

which case the market will automatically raise the minimum wage, or let the CBI

decide how many to let in.



Curtailing unskilled immigration from outside the EU will not be sufficient to

achieve a living wage. It will also require curtailing immigration from within

an ever-expanding EU. But an end to importing cheap labour has a "democratic"

downside. It will involve a transfer of purchasing power from the more numerous

and more likely to vote middle class to the less numerous and less likely to

vote working class, albeit tempered by a reduction in welfare costs.



Our mainstream political parties would probably find this electorally

unacceptable, although for anyone concerned about national cohesiveness it

should be a price worth paying. Everything else about the EU is "small print"

and not worthy of a referendum.
