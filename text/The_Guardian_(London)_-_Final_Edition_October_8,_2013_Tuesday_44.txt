Nick Clegg will today call for the rules of the European Union's single market

to be rewritten to allow Britain and other countries outside the eurozone to be

allowed to block changes proposed by members of the single currency.



In a major speech on the EU, the deputy prime minister will say he expects a

referendum on Britain's EU membership to be held in the coming years. He will

warn that leaving the EU would be "economic suicide". But he will indicate that

the Liberal Democrats might find common ground with the Tories in negotiations

on the EU's future. Clegg also will make it clear he shares David Cameron's view

that the rule that no member state should have a veto should be amended to

ensure the 17 eurozone members cannot force through changes against the will of

the countries outside the single currency.
