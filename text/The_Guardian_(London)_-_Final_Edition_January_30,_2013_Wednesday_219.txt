* Vernon Bogdanor is wrong to say we do not elect parliament to transfer its

powers to another body. Parliament transferred the whole of its functions in

Ireland to the Irish parliaments in 1920, its judicial functions from the Lords

to the supreme court in 2005, revoked its competence in Australia (1986) and

Canada (1982), and transferred a whole range of powers to the EU. He would do

better to examine how referendums are steadily weakening representative

government.
