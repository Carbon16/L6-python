Cameron urges curb on EU freedom of movement: Prime minister hints at UK veto on

new states joining Call comes at summit of EU leaders in Brussels

SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 9



LENGTH: 653 words





David Cameron yesterday called for an overhaul of one of the fundamental

freedoms of the European Union, the ability of all EU citizens to move freely in

the union.



The prime minister told a summit of EU leaders in Brussels that the criteria

used when negotiating the entry of new member states had to be changed to curb

"mass population movements".



He also hinted that Britain could veto the admission of new member states unless

the rules were changed, although there is no prospect of any further countries

joining the EU over the next decade.



According to witnesses at the summit, there were no responses from other leaders

to Cameron's call for a new regime on freedom of movement, one of the four basic

freedoms of the EU, along with capital, services, and goods.



"We must return the principle of free movement to what is reasonable," the prime

minister said. "There is a need to tackle free movement abuse."



His remarks went beyond measures to restrict the rights of EU newcomers to

Britain to claim benefits, moves announced in advance of opening Britain to

Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January.



"As we contemplate countries like Serbia or Albania one day joining the EU we

must find a way to slow down access to each other's labour markets until we can

be sure that it will not cause vast migrations. We need to return the principle

of free movement to a more sensible basis and make it clear that it cannot be a

completely unqualified right."



In the cases of Bulgaria and Romania, Cameron said: "There is freedom of

movement to come and get a job. There is not free movement to come and claim."



But he went further than the immediate issue of the two Balkan countries,

arguing that in future curbs should be introduced when membership is being

negotiated.



He told the other leaders, according to sources, that a candidate country's

wealth should determine whether its citizens would enjoy the right to move

across the EU when it joined. Wage levels and a country's gross domestic product

were especially important benchmarks, he said.



"It's a big reversal of Britain's (EU) enlargement policy," said an EU official.

"The UK has always been the champion of enlargement. That's changed. ."



There was no sign of support for the British position at the summit, according

to sources. The European commission says the fundamentals of freedom of movement

cannot be tampered with.



Despite the move by the home secretary, Theresa May, to prevent newcomers to

Britain from claiming benefits for three months after their arrival, Cameron

admitted that the government had inadequate data on the issue.



The clampdown, which was rushed through, demonstrated the anxiety in Downing

Street at the possible reaction of Tory voters - and restive backbenchers - to

Romanians and Bulgarians travelling to Britain en masse.



Hinting at the possible blocking of further states joining, Cameron pointedly

noted that admitting a new country to the EU required the unanimous backing of

all 28 countries. Sources said Cameron wanted to use the issue as another lever

to try to force a renegotiation of EU treaties to try to secure a new deal for

Britain in Europe before possibly putting the UK's membership to the vote in a

2017 referendum.



He repeated his calls for treaty change, despite the lack of enthusiasm almost

everywhere else in the EU. Cameron noted Germany's push at the summit for a new

system of binding contracts among eurozone countries forcing economic reforms, a

proposal that received minimal support and was shelved until towards the end of

next year.



Cameron described such potential changes as "far-reaching". He said: "This will

obviously mean much deeper integration (in the eurozone). This will require

treaty change."



He added: "We need to go one step further and look at more robust transitional

controls in the future." He said he agreed with the Dutch that Albania should

not be allowed to open membership negotiations yet.

Comment: We can't rely on Merkel to sort out Europe's problems: Cameron hopes

the German chancellor will help him keep Britain in the EU, but she's focused on

her own country



BYLINE: Martin Kettle



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 35



LENGTH: 1070 words





The long delayed formation of a new German government this week ought to be a

moment of opportunity for our part of the world. Angela Merkel scored a personal

triumph in the 2013 general election and has never been politically stronger.

The grand coalition between Merkel's CDU-CSU Christian democrats and the SPD

social democrats has an overwhelming majority in the Bundestag. No other

significant nation in the current EU has both a strong economy and a strong

government - certainly not France, clinging to the past and teetering on the

brink of a new recession. Not Britain either, we should note.



The stage ought therefore to be set for a strong and broadly based new Merkel

government to lead Germany and Europe on a new and more purposeful course. Some

of us have tried from time to time to persuade ourselves that this may indeed

now happen - that a third-term Merkel government might shake off the cautious

approach that her earlier governments brought to the task of dealing with

Europe's shared problems. We speculated that an alliance with the SPD might

provide the reassurance for a bipartisan, reforming approach to Germany's

economic problems and for a less deflationary, austerity-driven approach to

those of Greece, Spain, Portugal and the rest of the eurozone.



Parochial optimism about the opportunities created by Merkel's win has also been

quietly in evidence among Britain's pro-Europeans and, in particular, in 10

Downing Street. He won't say it in public, but David Cameron continues to hope

that the Merkel alliance is the key to Britain remaining a member of the EU.

Cameron hopes she will somehow help him to construct a plausible offer that a

re-elected Tory premier can put to the British people in a referendum in 2017

with a good prospect of winning the vote to stay in the EU.



But such speculations are largely wishful thinking. We do inhabit the Merkel

era. But the chancellor doesn't do daring. She has dominated in the past by

cautious pragmatism, and there is every reason to suppose she will continue to

dominate by the same means. For reasons that include German history, coalition

politics, the chancellor's character and the difficulty of persuading all 28 EU

member states to adopt a common approach, the Merkel era is likely to remain an

era of expediency.



The new government's 185-page coalition agreement underlines that approach.

Merkel may be the one European leader who from to time has actually faced

Germans and Europeans with the devastating syllogism that Europe has 7% of the

world's people, who possess 25% of the world's wealth and award themselves 50%

of the world's social spending - with the clear (and surely correct) implication

that a globalised economy and the rise of China make this hard to sustain

without reform. But she is also the leader who, in the post-election coalition

negotiations, willingly gave the SPD all the extra social spending and benefits

that the social democratic chair, Sigmar Gabriel, insisted, probably correctly,

would be necessary to ensure his party voted for a coalition that many of its

members think is against their interests.



As a result, many of the larger questions facing Germany and Europe - and so

also facing Britain - were once again fudged. In particular, the ever-growing

demographic squeeze on Germany caused by the combination of low birth-rates and

higher life expectancy - by 2060, one German in three will be 65 or over - was

not just ignored but compounded in the negotiations. In the same week George

Osborne announced Britain's latest increase in the UK retirement age in his

autumn statement, the German coalition negotiators agreed to cuts in the

retirement age for long-serving workers and increased pensions for older

mothers, all of which will have to be paid for by those who remain in work.



Germany's current-account surplus means that the new government can afford to

make these changes. Germany's somewhat more positive general attitude to the

migration that comes in its wake helps too - a stark contrast to the

press-driven, Ukip-fuelled anti-migrant panic in Britain. Even so, all this has

a back-to-the-future feel, especially from the SPD, which seems increasingly

determined to write Gerhard Schroder's Agenda 2010 reforms out of its history as

a Blairite aberration. It also goes in the opposite direction to the welfare,

salary and jobs cuts that Germany has been instrumental in inflicting on other

EU nations, and will inevitably open Germany to the charge that it expects

others to give up security that is being strengthened for its own citizens. The

braver course would have been to cut the eurozone a bit of slack and to grip EU

-wide banking reform more firmly. But that did not happen.



None of this suggests that Merkel was thinking much about Europe when she made

her coalition deal. In one sense this is hardly a surprise, so there is no point

being too indignant about it. Yet it should be recognised that it comes at a

high price for Europeans, because only Germany has the weight to reform Europe

in a sensible and balanced way that reflects the seriousness of globalisation's

long-term economic challenge to the European tax and social welfare model -

which we all share, whether or not we remain part of the EU.



None of this is good news for Cameron or for those who want Britain to remain

committed to an EU that delivers economic benefits and security for its

citizens. Merkel's strategy for the British vote is by no means as clear as some

in London would like to think. Britain, with its infinitely solipsistic

political culture and its tendency to lecture and denigrate Europe, as usual

does itself few favours in the contest for the chancellor's ear. London's

panic-driven anxiety to attack the right to freedom of movement for EU citizens

does nothing to suggest the UK is a reliable long-term partner in a reformed EU

project.



Moreover, Merkel is a politician with other audiences to please. Like every

other EU head of government meeting in Brussels today, she is a national

politician, not a pan-national one. Even at the height of the eurozone crisis,

it is said, Merkel rarely spent more than 40% of her working time on European

matters. Today that figure is put at 10%. It may be tempting to want to think of

Merkel as the re-elected Frau Europa. But, unless she shows otherwise, the

larger reality is that she is the re-elected Frau Deutschland.

G2: Shortcuts: Pass notes: No 3,235 Rodney Atkinson



SECTION: GUARDIAN FEATURES PAGES; Pg. 3



LENGTH: 362 words





Age: 65.



Appearance: Moustache, clothes, a smile, as if he's in on a joke.



I'm glad about the clothes. What's the joke? It varies. Currently that the whole

world except him has been fooled into thinking that Nelson Mandela was a nice

guy.



Whereas in fact . . .? Whereas in fact these are "obnoxious, sycophantic lies",

according to him. "His legacy is a murderous one," he is quoted as saying in the

Daily Telegraph, "comparable, in its racist and economic persecution of a

minority, to the Nazis' treatment of the Jews."



So he thinks that Nelson Mandela was similar to Adolf Hitler? Yes. Obviously one

campaigned for equality and peace while the other led a global race war, but if

you can see past that it's almost spooky.



His opinions are quite fun. Got any more? Plenty. The EU "has promoted and

funded the ethnic cleansing of (various groups)" and is essentially the

fulfilment of the third reich's ambitions to subdue all of Europe beneath the

German yoke.



Crikey, who is he? "One of Britain's most successful political economists," his

website says.



Does anybody else? Not that I can find. He's also Rowan Atkinson's big brother.



Oh dear . . . He's lost elections on behalf of the Referendum party and Ukip. He

was pals with Norris McWhirter, who at one time held the Guinness World Record

for being the most rightwing man on children's television. And the media are

officially allowed to call him "eccentric" after he tried to prosecute the

foreign secretary for treason, according to the Press Complaints Commission.



Yes, well, that sounds eccentric to me. Is Rowan on board with Rodney's

theories? That's a no. There are a number of sibling disagreements. Rodney said

he was "appalled" by Rowan's sketch for Comic Relief this year, which portrayed

the Archbishop of Canterbury as a trendy vicar and used the word "shagging".

Rodney also claims that the Mr Bean TV series was his idea.



Awkward. Christmas at their place is going to be like: "Ooh, pass the bread

sauce, Rodney. It's to your right, if that's possible." Probably.



Do say: "If you play a recording of the Lisbon treaty backwards, it says: 'Ein

Volk . . . ein Reich . . . ein Fuhrer . . .'"



Don't say: "Eccentric!"

Greece's ex-king goes home after 46-year exile



BYLINE: Helena Smith in Athens



SECTION: GUARDIAN INTERNATIONAL PAGES; Pg. 17



LENGTH: 236 words





Greeks who have the means may be leaving in droves, but after 46 years in exile

the former king, Constantine II, has moved back to his crisis-plagued homeland.



The deposed monarch, who was forced to flee Athens shortly after the seizure of

power by a group of army officers in 1967, has stunned Greeks - and most of his

relatives in the royal households of Europe - by resettling in the capital where

he was born. "He and Anne-Marie have decided to move here permanently," said a

member of Greece's small circle of royalists, referring to Constantine's Danish

wife.



Soaring property prices in London apparently spurred the move. But Constantine,

who was dethroned by referendum on the return of democracy in 1974 and stripped

of his Greek citizenship by the then socialist government 20 years later, is

known to have been homesick.



The 73-year-old, a first cousin of the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince William's

godfather, had his palaces and other royal estates expropriated in 1994. The

European court of human rights ruled that the Greek state compensate Constantine

for a fraction of the £320m he had sought.



Earlier this year, however, Constantine struck lucky when he sold his north

London mansion for £9.5m. By contrast, property prices in Athens have plummeted

to the point where flats are selling for as little as euros 6,000 (£5,000) in

the city centre.



The former monarch has repeatedly denied political ambitions.

We'll leave UK if it quits EU, says Goldman Sachs



BYLINE: Sean Farrell



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 32



LENGTH: 282 words





Goldman Sachs has said it would move much of its European business out of London

if Britain leaves the European Union.



The warning from the world's most powerful investment bank comes as political

pressure for Britain to leave the EU mounts. David Cameron has committed to

holding a referendum on Britain's membership if the Conservatives win the next

election and some Tory MPs have been agitating for an early vote on the matter.



Michael Sherwood, co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs International, said: "In

all likelihood we would transfer a substantial part of our European business

from London to a eurozone location - the most obvious contenders being Paris and

Frankfurt."



The City of London became the hub for international financial companies as they

went global in the late 1980s. The financial sector is supported by a large

network of law firms, accountants and other support services that employ

millions.



International banks such as Goldman and Morgan Stanley employ thousands in

Britain working on projects and trading assets across Europe. Goldman employs

6,000 of its 7,000 European staff in the UK.



Liberal Democrat MEP Sharon Bowles said Sherwood's comments to Germany's

Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung showed there would be big job losses in Britain's

financial sector if the UK left the EU."



Goldman has argued that Britain needs to stay in the EU for London to maintain

its position as the continent's financial centre. It has said that any shift

would be gradual but inevitable.



The City of London Corporation has said leaving the EU is a constant worry for

financial institutions based in London. A recent CBI poll found that nearly 80%

of UK businesses supported membership.

Society: Councils take on the big six energy firms: Prompted by fuel poverty,

local authorities in Britain and Ireland are generating their own cheaper power



BYLINE: Peter Hetherington



SECTION: GUARDIAN SOCIETY PAGES; Pg. 36



LENGTH: 1359 words





Councils once powered much of Britain - literally. After bringing clean water,

sanitation and public health to households, they saw energy as an extension of a

social obligation to liberate the masses.



When the City of Carlisle opened a new power station in 1927, it even invoked

Emile Zola in the foreword to a fancy commemorative brochure: "The time must

come when electricity will be for everyone, like the waters of the earth and the

winds of heaven. It must be provided . . . liberally, enabling the people to use

it as they wish, like the air which they breathe."



Now that same enthusiasm for community wellbeing is fuelling a

counter-revolution in locally generated energy, in both Britain and Ireland,

partly to address rising levels of fuel poverty (when more than 10% of take-home

pay is spent on heating bills) affecting an estimated 3.5m UK families.



With energy companies this week unveiling a variety of modest price "revisions"

to assuage public anger over profiteering in advance of George Osborne's autumn

statement tomorrow, the case for a return to local electricity generation to

challenge the "big six" is gaining momentum. Some talk boldly of

"re-municipalising energy", with an eye on Hamburg, Germany's second city.

Recently, in a referendum there, voters backed a council plan to take control of

the local power grid.



Local schemes



Here, authorities from Labour-controlled Southampton to Conservative-run Woking,

in Surrey, are finding it cheaper to provide heat and light for their own

buildings. A string of others are considering local power schemes.



Currently, mainly council houses and public buildings are powered locally, along

with some shops and offices - rather than entire cities - although Southampton's

municipal plant, run with a private company, provides electricity for the city's

huge port, as well as for council buildings. Hot water was originally tapped

from a deep geothermal well for a district heating scheme 25 years ago, and this

was followed by a combined heat and power plant. But the city hopes soon to

provide heat and light for 1,500 council houses as part of a £30m district

heating and insulation scheme triggered by authorities once again being allowed

to take direct control of council house funding. More than 5,000 houses could

follow.



Like many, the city has wider ambitions. "The business case speaks for itself,"

says Warwick Payne, Southampton city council's cabinet member for housing and

sustainability. "As plugging into the national grid becomes increasingly

expensive, local energy schemes will become the way to go." But while piped

heating directly to homes and businesses is unregulated, alternative suppliers

seeking to expand electricity supply currently face a "cap" beyond which they

have to enter an expensive national pool.



Similarly in Woking, council buildings, offices and flats are powered by energy

from a company owned by the local council. The company, Thameswey, also

generates power from a much larger local plant for much of central Milton

Keynes, in Buckinghamshire.



Thameswey opened its first combined heat and power scheme in 2001 to supply

electricity and heating to civic offices, and surrounding business, in Woking

town centre. The initial £7m funding was borrowed on Thameswey's behalf by

Woking council, which then lent it back to the company at 2% above the going

interest rate. Currently it has 1.3 miles of heating pipes and electricity wires

in the town (with a further 2.5 miles in central Milton Keynes). The scheme will

soon expand to serve a new, £150m shopping and leisure centre, with 300 flats.



John Thorp, Thameswey's managing director, sees potential for a big expansion in

local energy schemes, driven by enterprising councils. "Look at the average

local authority - the buildings they have and control, their assets - you can

see this approach taking off in other areas," he says.



Price stability, rather than profit, is the main draw for the new wave of local

generators, with the attraction of guaranteed supplies of cheaper energy.



With some consumers facing price rises of over 10% in today's privatised market

- though Osborne may persuade companies to hold fire - it is worth remembering

that in the early-to mid-20th century the profit motive related to energy was

anathema. Almost 370 municipal electricity schemes supplied relatively cheap

power to the urban population, using surpluses for investment rather than

dividends to shareholders.



Carlisle - motto: "Be just and fear not" - was then a small border city with big

ambitions. Like larger cities around the country, it first began generating from

a small station in the late 19th century. When demand outstripped supply, the

council opted for a modern power station, beside a river (essential for cooling)

with a rail siding for the delivery of coal. In the commemorative brochure, it

emphasised the need . . . "to ensure a reliable and sufficient supply to meet

all demands".



The council undertaking stayed in municipal hands for 20 years until the postwar

Labour government nationalised electricity and created 14 area electricity

boards. These were privatised by a Conservative government in the 1980s, which,

arguably, sold them - like the recent Royal Mail sale - well below their market

value.



Adversity is now proving the mother of municipal enterprise. "For the moment our

priority is to help low-income families paying for antiquated heating systems

because, as a nation, we did not invest enough during the last century," says

Southampton's Payne. "But if you plan this properly you can create local jobs,

cut your carbon footprint and reduce the energy bills - so everybody wins."



That enterprising spirit was underlined at a recent Dublin conference, when

delegates from councils in seven European nations met to conclude a three-year

EU project addressing local energy, organised by the Town and Country Planning

Association (of which I am a trustee). While Southampton held out the vision of

authorities generating power on a larger scale, Cornwall raised the prospect of

tapping geothermal energy from the county's granite base. The council insists

its slogan - "A localised energy future for Cornwall" - is no pipe dream, with

many communities showing interest in small-scale generating schemes.



Delegates were particularly impressed by the ambitions of Kerry county council,

in south-west Ireland. Under the mantra "Turning green into gold", it is



championing a "wood energy", or biomass - small pellets from local timber -

project,



which has already created hundreds of jobs. The aim is to make the county's two

largest towns, Tralee, and Killarney, self-sufficient in heating by 2016.



Already in Tralee, a large wood-fuelled boiler plant provides piped heating to

scores of new houses and renewed properties - older houses that are

"retro-fitted" with external insulation panels - a large school, a community

centre and a government building. The aim is to extend the network to the local

hospital and a college, then to the town's 6,000 houses through a seven-mile

local grid. A similar project is planned for Killarney.



In the local "pay-as-you-use" energy scheme, householders use a small bar-coded

card to build up fuel credits during the summer. A tiny smart meter, in each

house, monitors energy use. In her 1930s semi, Angela Welsh, 61, says she used

to pay the equivalent of £500 annually for oil for central heating. Now she pays

half that amount. On a wall, a smart meter reveals she is around £60 in credit.

"One of my sisters, who lives in Norwich, can't believe how low bills are now

compared to Britain," she says. "We used to be freezing in the winter, and only

heated one room. Now it's too warm."



The same cannot be said for millions of others, on both sides of the Irish Sea,

facing the coming winter. But with energy security and price now burning issues,

locally generated power could become a practical alternative, provided the "cap"

on local generation is lifted? Back to the future, perhaps?

Front: Shock four-country poll reveals the widening gulf between UK and EU



BYLINE: by Toby Helm, Political Editor



SECTION: OBSERVER HOME NEWS PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 835 words





A powerful cross-party alliance including former Tory foreign secretary Malcolm

Rifkind and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg is calling for an urgent fightback

against spiralling anti-European sentiment as a new four-nation poll suggests

the UK could be heading out of the EU.



The landmark survey of more than 5,000 voters in the UK, Germany, France and

Poland finds British people far more hostile to the EU and its policies than

those in the other EU states, and strikingly low support for British membership

among people on the continent.



At the same time, the total numbers of people in Germany and France who support

giving Britain a special deal on membership to satisfy British opinion are

heavily outnumbered by those who oppose doing so, which suggests that David

Cameron may struggle to achieve his hoped-for tailor-made arrangement for the

UK.



Testing cultural opinions, the poll finds very few British people choose to

describe themselves as European. In other EU nations, enthusiasm for the concept

of Europeanism is far higher.



Opinium found that just 26% of British voters regard the EU as, overall, a "good

thing" compared with 42% who say it is a "bad thing". In Poland 62% say it is a

good thing and 13% bad; in Germany 55% good and 17% bad, and in France 36% good

and 34% bad.



When asked about the UK's contribution to the EU, there is little enthusiasm

among our partners, and little to suggest they will go out of their way to keep

us in. Just 9% of Germans and 15% of French people think the UK is a positive

influence on the EU, with more Poles, 33%, taking that view.



Only 16% of Germans and 26% of French people back the idea of a special deal

being struck for the UK. Cameron has said he intends to renegotiate the UK terms

of entry and hold an in/out referendum if he wins a majority at the next

election, offering the new arrangement to the British people in a referendum.



The idea of Britain leaving the EU does not appear to worry our European

partners unduly. Just 24% of French voters said a UK exit would have a negative

effect, compared with 36% of Germans and 51% of Poles.



Last night Rifkind said: "There needs to be a serious debate about the real

benefits of - as well as the real problems about - British membership of the EU.

Without it we could do serious damage to Britain's interests."



Clegg said next year's European elections represented a key test and attacked

those intent on taking Britain out of the EU. He said: "Everybody knows the EU

needs reform. But simply carping from the sidelines and flirting with exit

undermines British leadership in the EU, fails to deliver reform and leaves

Britain increasingly isolated. The debate about Europe is no longer about who is

for or against reform - everybody agrees on that - it is between those who

believe we can lead in the EU and those who want to head for the exit.



"That's why next year's elections will be so important: the Liberal Democrats

will be the leading party of 'in'. It's time we challenged Ukip and large swaths

of the Conservative party who want to betray Britain's vital national interest

by pulling us out of the world's largest borderless single market, on which

millions of jobs depend."



Labour MP and former Europe minister Peter Hain urged pro-Europeans to stand up

and fight: "This is a wake-up call for British pro-Europeans that Britain -

especially if the Tories win the next election - is heading for an exit from the

EU which would be an utter disaster for British jobs, prosperity and influence

in the world. But it is equally a wake-up call for the Brussels Bubble, which is

totally out of touch with Europe's citizens."



The poll shows concern about immigration to be almost as high in France as in

the UK. In Britain, 64% of voters think the EU's immigration policies have a

negative effect; 59% say the same in France.



It also reveals that more UK voters feel an affinity with the US than with their

European neighbours, whereas our EU partners tend to choose other EU nations.

When asked who they would generally support on occasions when there was a

disagreement between the US and EU countries, 37% of UK respondent said they

would tend to support America; just 10% would generally side with Europe.



British people are not negative about everything the EU does: 54% think free

movement rules are good for tourism against 6% who think the reverse. There is

also strong endorsement for free-trade benefits. Nearly half of those polled say

the absence of customs controls and tariffs on goods and services is an

advantage. Only 10% see free trade as a disadvantage.



Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: "This is a fascinating and comprehensive study

into the relative relationships between countries within and about the EU. We,

on these islands feel, due to our history as a globally trading nation, much

more at home with our cousins in the Anglosphere than we do with our friends on

the continent."

EU referendum bid House of Cards writer to present bill in Lords



BYLINE: Rowena Mason, political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 24



LENGTH: 224 words





Lord Dobbs of Wylye, the man who wrote the political thriller House of Cards, is

to introduce the Conservative bill pledging an EU referendum into the House of

Lords. The peer and novelist will attempt to win support for the bill in the

upper chamber, where it may run into trouble as it is opposed by both Labour and

the Liberal Democrats.



The EU referendum bill, promising a poll before 2018, is a Tory-backed bill

rather than a government one, as Nick Clegg does not support it. This means it

has to be sponsored by backbenchers, with 29-year-old James Wharton, MP for

Stockton South, taking it through the Commons over the last few Fridays.



The legislation is heading to the Lords after it cleared its third Commons

reading unopposed. Many opposition MPs, such as Labour's Mike Gapes, gave long

and irrelevant speeches in a bid to make it run out of parliamentary time, but

it eventually passed without a vote.



Wharton accused Labour and the Liberal Democrats of having done "absolutely

everything in their power" to frustrate the bill in the Commons, and warned

peers not to try similar tactics.



Dobbs said: "I am delighted to be introducing this bill into the House of Lords.

This is the first time for a generation that the public will be given the

opportunity to have their say on membership of the EU." Rowena Mason

Comment: Merkel's sham victory: Germany may look like the strong man of Europe,

but a coalition deal will kill off crucial reforms



BYLINE: Alan Posener



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 30



LENGTH: 697 words





So, in democracies the people elect their government, right? Well, not in

Germany. Two months ago, the Germans gave Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats

41.5% of the vote. Her nearest rivals, the Social Democrats, got 25.7%. However,

Merkel hasn't been able to get herself elected chancellor yet. She is still

negotiating with the losers about forming a coalition. And the losers are

dictating the agenda.



Welcome to proportional representation. This, together with the fractured nature

of the electorate, ensures that the composition of governments is decided in

backroom deals. Since Merkel couldn't gain an absolute majority, and since she

lost her previous coalition partner - the liberal Free Democrats, who were voted

out of parliament - she has to form a coalition with the Greens or the Social

Democrats, the very people she claimed in the election would ruin the country.

The Greens declined; the Social Democrats agreed to negotiate.



Second, welcome to Merkel's modus operandi, which is to let things drift until

the last moment. The coalition talks are to be wrapped up tomorrow, and still

nobody knows who will get what, and how much of the wish list the negotiators

have drawn up will make its way into Merkel's programme.



And third, brinkmanship. Sigmar Gabriel, the SDP leader, has promised his party

that the coalition agreement will be subjected to a plebiscite of the party rank

and file. It's a bit like David Cameron promising a referendum on EU membership

in the hope that this will force the other member states to give him what he

wants. Unlike Cameron, Gabriel seems to be getting away with it.



This means a tiny fraction of the electorate will decide whether we get a new

government or go to the polls again. And since the party faithful are more

radical than a party's voters, Gabriel has been able to use the prospect of

their rejecting the coalition agreement to put "social democratic handwriting"

on it.



It seems likely the agreement will include a minimum wage of euros 8.50; higher

pensions for non-working mothers and the poor; more exemptions from the pension

age of 67; rent controls in cities like Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich; and other

sops to anti-capitalist feeling. This may seem like good news for Germany's

struggling "partners" in the eurozone, as it will reduce its competitiveness.

And as it will put more money in the hands of pensioners, a splurge on handouts

also goes some way to countering the charges made by the European commission

that Germany is pursuing a mercantilist (trade) policy at the expense of the

rest of the EU.



However, the emphasis on money for pensioners, rather than for education;

handouts for retirement-age mothers rather than help for young mothers; rent

controls rather than innovative social housing - in a word on policies that

either cater directly to the grey-haired majority or reflect its views - is

symbolic. Germany may look like the strong man of Europe but its underlying

weaknesses are obvious.



Germany is ageing and shrinking. France and Britain will overtake it soon, in

terms of population. Too few women enter the workforce and they have too few

children. Germany is over-reliant on industry and underperforms in services.

Over half of every generation leaves school after 10 years, often with only a

rudimentary knowledge of English and similar cultural skills. Immigrants are

still not welcome. Most of these problems could be fixed with quotas for women

in senior management and for immigrants in the civil service and the police;

allowing dual citizenship; and encouraging kids to stay at school. But these

reforms are unlikely to happen.



No, it's not good news. And it gets worse. As part of his pivot to the left,

Gabriel has promised that the Social Democrats will be open to coalitions with

the Left party, the heirs of the East German Communists. Since the SPD, the Left

and the Greens already hold a majority in parliament, the temptation for Gabriel

to break with Merkel in, say, two years to form a "red-red-green" coalition with

himself as chancellor could become irresistible. And then Germany will be in

real trouble.

Comment: Open borders are a turn-off: Economic insecurity and fears about new EU

migration are leading many voters to the right



BYLINE: Colin Hines Colin Hines is convenor of the Green New Deal Group



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 54



LENGTH: 620 words





A deluge of support for extreme right parties and Ukip - the party that

advocates extreme free markets for everything except people - is the unsettling

expectation when Europe goes to the polls in six months' time. Austerity or

austerity-lite policies of the ruling right, left and centre that worsen the

economic insecurity of the majority make this rightward lurch inevitable.

Another huge political turn-off for most Europeans is the political

establishment's view that an uncontrolled flow of citizens across borders is an

unchallengeable force of EU nature, akin to gravity. Watch electoral support for

the establishment crumble further after 1 January as the public responds to the

predicted increase of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria.



The usual UK response to this grim state of affairs is for those in the

Westminster bubble to call for a referendum on whether it would be more

efficient in market terms to be inside Europe. Big business champions the

former, Ukip the latter, with pro- or anti-EU politicians affirming that their

way is the route to a nirvana of increased international competition and booming

exports. Of course, some try to have it both ways by claiming we can win this

game with a canny "race-to-the-top" approach to wages and conditions. To such

fantasists, there is a one-word answer: "Grangemouth". The unions and workers

were crushed, as will always be the case, by the threat from big business to

relocate. This has been allowed to become a trump card because all major

political parties support open markets.



To turn the EU from its job-destroying, socially divisive and environmentally

damaging trajectory will require a continent-wide debate, backed up by a

referendum about whether member states should be allowed to protect and

rediversify their economies. This would mean returning to the nation state the

power to control the flow of goods, money, services and people at their borders.

Such a grouping of countries would need to work co-operatively to tackle

cross-border issues, such as climate change, pollution and crime.



Europe is a powerful enough bloc to implement such a radical programme. It is

likely to find increasing support from a populus fast falling out of love with

open borders. The lightning rod to force public discussion of these changes is

the resentment felt by the majority about the Brussels diktat over the free flow

of people within Europe. Ukip does well, not because people are bothered about

Europe per se, but because Nigel Farage can correctly say that if the UK left

the EU it could take back control of immigration.



The centre and left have an aversion to discussing the democratic deficit

inherent in the denial of the majority's desire for stricter immigration

control. The usual use of statistics showing that fit, young, ambitious

immigrants pay more taxes and use fewer public services holds less sway than

more tangible local examples of the pressure new eastern European families are

putting upon overstretched maternity wards and infant schools. Immigration,

though usually good for the migrants concerned, is a bosses' charter. Those with

the upper hand range from owners of big food processing, care or hospitality

companies to the middle classes cooing about how polite, hardworking and cheap

eastern European workers are.



Of course, achieving such a huge U-turn will take time. The expected triumph of

the extreme right and extreme free traders in the 2014 elections must finally

wake us up to the need to put border controls and economic security at the heart

of debates about future alternatives. The centre left will be forced to face up

to their self-inflicted defeat. Not before time.

MPs reject early vote on EU membership



BYLINE: Rowena Mason Political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 25



LENGTH: 151 words





David Cameron has seen off an attempt by Tory rebels to force a referendum on

Britain's European Union membership before the next election.



Conservative MPs voted overwhelmingly against a proposal to bring forward the

date of a referendum tabled by Adam Afriyie - a backbencher said to be keen to

oust Cameron as Tory leader.



The Commons voted yesterday by 249 votes to 15 against Afriyie's amendment to

the European Union (referendum) bill, which is backed by the Tory leadership and

states there will be a poll before the end of 2017.



The Conservative leadership successfully argued that a referendum must be held

after attempts to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels, which could

take several years.



Afriyie, the MP for Windsor, insisted he was right to press ahead. By putting

the 2014 option before parliament, I was reflecting the opinion of the vast

majority of the British people," he said.

eastern European workers are.



Of course, achieving such a huge U-turn will take time. The expected triumph of

the extreme right and extreme free traders in the 2014 elections must finally

wake us up to the need to put border controls and economic security at the heart

of debates about future alternatives. The centre left will be forced to face up

to their self-inflicted defeat. Not before time.

MPs reject early vote on EU membership



BYLINE: Rowena Mason Political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 25



LENGTH: 151 words





David Cameron has seen off an attempt by Tory rebels to force a referendum on

Britain's European Union membership before the next election.



Conservative MPs voted overwhelmingly against a proposal to bring forward the

date of a referendum tabled by Adam Afriyie - a backbencher said to be keen to

oust Cameron as Tory leader.



The Commons voted yesterday by 249 votes to 15 against Afriyie's amendment to

the European Union (referendum) bill, which is backed by the Tory leadership and

states there will be a poll before the end of 2017.



The Conservative leadership successfully argued that a referendum must be held

after attempts to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels, which could

take several years.



Afriyie, the MP for Windsor, insisted he was right to press ahead. By putting

the 2014 option before parliament, I was reflecting the opinion of the vast

majority of the British people," he said.

&#10002;We're still the nasty party, says the Tory thinker Nick Boles. And yet

interesting things are happening. Here's a turn-up. MEP Syed Kamall has been

elected leader of the Tories in Europe. Thus the party of Enoch Powell and

Margaret "swamped by aliens" Thatcher, has what is believed to be its first

nationally significant elected leader of colour. Kamall is London born but of

Guyanese descent, which again raises the issue of the stranglehold that small

country seems to have on the social and political life of Britain as lived by

visible minorities: David Lammy, Baroness Amos, Lord Waheed Alli, Trevor

Phillips, Mike Phillips. Academics and other observers occasionally talk of a

Guyanese mafia. In 2007, with other lesser lights, they got their own Who's Who.

Will Kamall be allowed to join the grouping? Will he want to?



&#10002;Probably not. For being a certain sort of Tory, Kamal says nowt on his

website about ethnicity or ancestral journey. This is par for the course in the

party that looks askance at anything that might be described as identity

politics. But he would also be an awkward fit because the Guyanese mafia's axis

leans left, whereas Kamall is what Thatcherites would have described as dry as

dust. Something for PM Dave to think about here. Not that Kamall is any threat

to him domestically. But what appears to have propelled the new man to victory

in Europe is his robust Euroscepticism. "Syed's victory is certainly a move to a

more sceptical position," noted ConservativeHome yesterday. And the man himself

said: "I am determined that people will hear loud and clear our message of

reform in Europe, of a new relationship with the EU and of giving the British

people the right to accept or reject it in a referendum." So he may be breaking

new ground. But he may not embrace the mafiosi or please PM Dave.



&#10002;Still, quite a week for the Tories as Graham Stuart, honourable member

for Beverley and Holderness, becomes the first backbencher to declare war. The

enemy: Royal Mail. Stuart has produced stickers that constituents can use to

send mail addressed to Humberside (instead of East Yorkshire) back from whence

it came. "Residents, community leaders and MPs have repeatedly requested the

removal of North Humberside from the Royal Mail databases but they have

stubbornly and unreasonably refused," he told the Hull Daily Mail. His

geographically correct sticker says: "I don't live in Humberside! It's East

Yorkshire! Tell Royal Mail to stop using Humberside! Return to sender." Already

Mail bosses seem to be suing for peace. But then the appetite for war isn't what

it was.



&#10002;Even with best-laid plans, the timing can be wrong. And so, as the Rev

Paul Flowers faced the spotlight and allegations in the Mail on Sunday that he

used and purchased crystal meth, the Methodist Youth Assembly - the nascent

Referendum: Swiss fury at excess pay put to the vote: In a country synonymous

with wealth, John Hooper reports on a campaign which could result in a dramatic

narrowing of the salary gap



BYLINE: John Hooper



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 43



LENGTH: 908 words





The so-called 1:12 campaign is part of a broader drive for wealth redistribution

by the Swiss left that has won wide popular support.



Long-standing rumblings about executive excess were fuelled by the banking

crisis and the precarious position of the Swiss bank UBS. But the debate was

supercharged this year when the Swiss drug group Novartis agreed to pay its

outgoing chairman, Daniel Vasella, SFr72m (£49m). The payment, to persuade

Vasella not to use his knowledge to help rival pharmaceuticals, was described as

a "golden gag".



There followed a huge public and political backlash, with the Swiss justice

minister, Simonetta Sommaruga, saying the payoff was "a huge blow to the social

cohesion in our country" and that payouts on such a scale "undermined public

trust in the entire economy".



Novartis was forced to cancel the payout. But serious damage was done, and in a

referendum the following month more than two-thirds of Swiss voters backed a new

rule to ban golden hellos and goodbyes



Last month, the authorities paved the way for another vote, which could

introduce a minimum wage for the employed and unemployed alike. Further

referendums are planned on inheritance tax and the taxation of wealthy

foreigners.



"In recent years, we've seen high salaries get higher while other salaries have

stayed at much the same level, especially in terms of ordinary people's

disposable income," said David Roth, the organiser of the 1:12 campaign. "It has

become obvious that something is wrong."



But his arguments are contested by others. The free market thinktank Avenir

Suisse concluded in a recent study that the crucial difference was not between

the salaries of individuals, but between the incomes of households - and that

since more women had joined the workforce, that gap was narrowing.



What no one disputes is that top executives' salaries have skyrocketed. One of

Juso's most striking posters shows the change in the ratio of the average salary

among Swiss CEOs to the average wage. In 1984, it was six to one. By 2011, it

had reached 43 to one.



What is more, said Roth: "The biggest salaries are in the same places as the

biggest problems. Take UBS. The state has had to pour money into UBS because of

problems caused by the very people who earned the highest salaries. Last year,

the bank lost SFr2.5bn - and paid out SFr2.5bn in bonuses."



His opponents see the pay campaign as a potentially catastrophic assault on the

underpinnings of one of the world's freest economies.



"Deciding on wage levels is not a matter for the state," said Rudolf Minsch of

Economiesuisse, an umbrella organisation of Swiss firms. "It is one of the key

competences of every enterprise. And the freedom of enterprises to determine

wages is a key reason for Switzerland's success."



The country is blessed with a jobless rate of 3%; the average in EU-member

states its 11%. And, says Minsch, "A flexible labour market is the main driving

force behind low unemployment in this country."



He argues that one of the most important reasons for Switzerland's success has

been the freedom its companies enjoy to negotiate pay locally, adapting to

significant differences in the living standards of its 26 cantons. Adopting the

1:12 rule would mean imposing a restriction at national level for the first

time, setting what Minsch believes would be a hazardous precedent.



Opponents say the move could also prompt Swiss firms to outsource their

lowest-paid jobs in order to bring their CEOs' salaries under the new ceiling.

But, said Roth: "You would need to outsource - outside of Switzerland - every

single low-paid job in the firm concerned. And you just can't do that. You can't

outsource the work of a bank teller or a shop assistant to India."



Another fear is that curbs on executive pay would drive out foreign companies.

One of the best-known is in the FTSE 100: the mining and trading firm Glencore

Xstrata.



Switzerland might be better off without multinationals like that, said Beat

Ringger of the thinktank Denknetz. "They are in countries where the conditions

for workers are poor and the governments are often corrupt. I am sure that

sooner or later the international community is going to want to regulate these

things and that Switzerland will come under international pressure as a result

of having these companies on its territory."



Glencore Xstrata has its headquarters in the canton of Zug where corporate tax

is limited to 15.4%. For Ringger, "Switzerland is like a 5-star hotel giving

away its best suites for nothing. The biggest companies and the richest

individuals get to stay here without paying much tax and without being much

regulated."



Last month polls were suggesting the vote on 1:12 rule could be close, but in

recent days the no campaign - backed by the government and parliament - appears

to have turned the tide. A survey for Swiss television released on Wednesday

pointed to a 54% to 36% defeat for the proposal, with 10% so far undecided.



Roth complains that "our adversaries have mounted a campaign, in which some of

the media have become involved, aiming to stir up fear".



But for Ringger, big business is blackmailing the rest of the population. "They

are saying: 'If you do anything to harm our interests we will harm you.'"

Comment: Carpets and canapes won't decide the 2015 election: This is a critical

point for Cameron. He should be fixing his campaign plans; instead he's spending

his time on foreign jaunts



BYLINE: Simon Jenkins



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 35



LENGTH: 1078 words





When in trouble, scram. This is not the best maxim for a politician with his

back to the wall, but for David Cameron it is understandable. His ICM poll

rating has lost the shine of economic recovery and has reverted to the

eight-point deficit of last February. The shires are rebelling, and Labour's Ed

Miliband is surging. Small wonder the Northolt departure lounge appeals. With no

good war to fight, Cameron can seek relief in the red pile carpet, the guard of

honour, the fawning host and the intoxicating luxury of a foreign trip.



He is off to China. Only last month his chancellor, George Osborne, and London's

mayor, Boris Johnson, returned from Beijing with tales of dim sum, dancing girls

and oriental riches that would have wowed a Marco Polo. Cameron could not

resist. As the historian Anthony King recently remarked, not for nothing is he

"Britain's first dilettante prime minister since Herbert Asquith".



Cameron has beaten every record for global wanderlust, with more than 50 visits

to foreign states in three years. Some, such as last year's to Aung San Suu Kyi,

were irresistible. Repeat trips to the Gulf and India, and his visit to Latin

America, again last year, seem more like golfing trips with business cronies. A

June flight to Kazakhstan was the outcome of some murky relationship with Tony

Blair rather than anything to do with a £700m trade deal, let alone "raising

issues around human rights". There are now further visits to India and the Gulf.



These trips are supposedly to boost trade. After Labour's "ethical foreign

policy", Cameron has declared a "commercial foreign policy". As with the

Olympics, silly foreigners are thought unable to assess the quality of British

goods and services without having it schmoozed into them with lavish attention

and hospitality - and this from a country that lectures them on corruption.



In Saturday's Guardian, David Runciman warned of the danger to democratic

leaders of "dictator envy" at a time of economic woe. Cameron's fascination with

authoritarian regimes recalls that of British visitors to Italy before the war,

returning to purr about "how they make the trains run on time". This is the

dross of modern diplomacy. Cameron claimed to be able to attribute £13 billion

extra British exports to the Olympics. Like KPMG's now notorious "£15bn profit

from HS2", such figures emanate from paid cheerleader consultants. Britain's

trade gap with Europe actually plummeted after the Olympics to the worst on

record, despite a weak exchange rate, while trade with the rest of the world

showed little change. The idea that a sports fixture or a freebie visit from a

minister makes a difference is self-regarding folly.



Cameron, meanwhile, has a serious job of political reconstruction to execute

back home. This is the critical point in a parliament, 18 months from an

election, when policies must be finalised that will dictate the forthcoming

campaign. It is now that a leader must fix on his strategy and his campaign

team. Funds must be raised, marginal seats staffed, friends and enemies marked

out for contrasting attention.



The polling outlook for the Tories is disappointing but not disastrous. Cameron

may have been handicapped by recession and coalition compromise. But he remains

a dominant figure in his party and the country. He has a vigorous campaigning

style that has yet to be tested. It must be the very worst time for a leader to

go absent without leave.



Cameron has two powerful weapons in his armoury. First, the long-delayed

economic recovery has begun, with a carefully stoked housing boom as its clarion

call. Second, the leader's personal rating runs ahead of his party, and the

public regard him as still the best at his job. As "good in the crisis", he is

stronger than Miliband, though this is not uncommon for an opposition leader

facing an incumbent prime minister.



Such weapons do not constitute a campaign, but they are assets on which a

campaign is built. What most demoralises Tory supporters are Cameron's constant

unforced errors, the "29 U-turns and counting". The strangely ill-prepared

reforms to the NHS and social benefits are past redemption. But Cameron's

vacillation on an EU referendum, his antipathy to the countryside, and his

commitment to green taxes, wind turbines and HS2 have knocked the stuffing from

his party's most active loyalists. They cannot understand why he supports

marginal policies that most Tories detest.



Even on matters such as energy prices, Cameron was too easily wrongfooted by

Miliband's headline grabbing. The appearance is of a dysfunctional Downing

Street apparatus perpetually at the mercy of events. It limps along with a ball

and chain round its ankle composed of party financiers and corporate lobbyists.

The one issue on which Cameron felt strongly, gay marriage, was to many Tories

needlessly provocative to their core support. They cannot see why he could not

have finessed it, why he seems so aggressively metrosexual.



This would not have mattered in past times when Tory voters had nowhere else to

go. They have now. Nigel Farage's Ukip is doing to the Tory vote what Nick

Clegg's brief ascendancy in 2010 did to Gordon Brown. It is asset-stripping the

marginals. Farage has described Cameron's anti-rural planning minister, Nick

Boles, as a one-man Ukip recruiting sergeant. Boles's 300-unit housing estates

are improvised explosive devices under every Tory marginal. The unnecessary HS2

is a linear version of the same.



When Tories lie back in despair and dream of the next parliament, they pin their

hopes largely on the implausibility of Ed Miliband at No 10. They tell

themselves voters could not be so foolish as to give power to someone so

inexperienced and unconvincing. That is what Thatcher told herself in the autumn

of 1990. She refused to believe her party could prefer Michael Heseltine or John

Major. She was wrong. Nothing in politics is more dangerous than to think of the

implausible as impossible.



The next election will not be fought with carpets and canapes thousands of miles

from home. There are no votes in Kazakh contracts. The one British export likely

to appeal to the Chinese is tourism, and the best way Cameron can win that is to

end Theresa May's crazy visa controls. All it requires is the emphatic stroke of

a pen. Meanwhile Cameron's staff report that he is still spending between a

third and half of his working time on foreign affairs. Therein lies the road to

defeat.

Comment: The Tories' EU psychosis is leading them to disaster: David Cameron

failed to face down his party's nationalist demons while in opposition. Now he's

paying the price



BYLINE: Chris Huhne



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 24



LENGTH: 895 words





Europe is once again turning into a disaster for the Conservatives. The prime

minister is up for renegotiation and an in-out referendum: indeed it is his

idea. Implicitly, if renegotiation fails, we should leave. But as David Cameron

begins to realise the price of this promise in investment and jobs, he is

desperately trying to reassure business that he can win a plebiscite backing EU

membership.



The big guns are pounding. Last week a CBI report estimated that every British

household was £3,000 better off from membership, and urged that we stay. It

rejected a Norwegian or Swiss half-pregnant option where you apply the rules but

get no say over making them. Four-fifths of businesses backs EU membership,

according to polls.



On Friday Nissan's most senior global executive said his company would

reconsider its UK investment if we left. The company employs 6,500 people in the

north-east. These warnings could cost the Tories votes in manufacturing areas

where there are marginal seats.



The Conservatives, once the business party, are in the fevered grip of activists

who have no conception of what matters to the economy or indeed the electorate.

Ambitious Tory MPs know how to stroke their party's erogenous zones, which is

why the MP Adam Afriyie is playing games in calling for a referendum next year,

before the election.



On Saturday the Bruges Group, whose principal purpose is to keep a candle

flickering at the altar of St Maggie, held a conference in London entitled

"Which way out? How Britain can withdraw from the EU". The Tory right is busy

plotting the how, not the why.



This is lunacy. The EU is simply incapable of being the bogeyman the Tory right

and the UK Independence party try to put up. Its institutions are small: they

employ 47,500 people, 11% of the size of the UK civil service. EU spending is 1%

of EU output, or less than a 40th of total public spending. EU law is usually

mind-bogglingly technical, and largely about establishing common standards.

Without that effort, differing consumer protection can block trade. Unlike any

other institution designed to tackle cross-national problems, the EU even has

elected officials.



Nor does the electorate give a toss. Our EU membership does not even rank in the

top 10 issues concerning voters. In an Ipsos Mori poll in September, just 1%

said it was the most important issue facing Britain, compared with 25%

specifically citing the economy. Even Ukip-Tory switchers worry more about

immigration and the economy than about EU membership. Yet Tory activists are

obsessed with the issue.



How can we explain this? The Tories are a mix of two strands. The first is the

whiggish, market-oriented and socially liberal strand. The second is the old

Tory English nationalist tradition: militaristic, authoritarian and xenophobic.



That English nationalist strand runs all the way through Tory history: the

archetypal leader in that tradition was Lord Salisbury. As a result, the Tory

party has always needed a foreign bogeyman: the French until the entente

cordiale in 1904, the Germans until 1945, and the Soviet Union until the fall of

the Berlin wall in 1989.



When the Soviets could no longer credibly perform the role of foreign threat,

who should volunteer but Jacques Delors, then European commission president and

a French socialist who proclaimed to the Trades Union Congress in September 1988

that there had to be a "social Europe". As the commission's campaign for its

1992 Maastricht treaty gathered strength, the Tory right had its enemy.



Boris Johnson, then the Daily Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, performed his

own walk-on role in the transformation by inventing an entirely new - and

largely fictitious - brand of journalism known as the "bent-banana story". The

story, in many guises, held that the EU was about to legislate some daft law

that would threaten a way of life enjoyed by free-born Englishmen since King

Ethelred.



In fact, the EU offers a prize that has been the objective of English foreign

policy since the Tudors. We were a small trading nation that wanted to stop any

domination that would close our continental markets. We spent blood and treasure

fighting the Spanish, French and Germans to achieve that objective. Now the EU

gives us what we always craved - and the Tory nationalists look the gift horse

in the mouth.



Pity the redundant Tory nationalist, because we live in a period with fewer

external threats to our existence than at any time in our history. But the need

for a foreign bogeyman does not depend on reality: it is a psychological urge

that tells you more about the person who holds those views than about the world.



This psychosis is a massive problem for Tory leaders. Cameron should have faced

down these demons in opposition, just as his hero Tony Blair faced down the

nationalisers with the abolition of clause IV from Labour's constitution. The

tragedy for the Tories - and for Cameron's project - is that he never did.



Worse, he threw red meat to rightwingers with a promise in his leadership

campaign to withdraw from the European People's party, the pro-EU grouping that

contains the sane continental conservative parties.



Cameron now lacks the courage to refuse more of the concessions that he began.

That British politics is enduring a period of public disdain is hardly in doubt

- although it is worth noting, in passing, that in a recent poll only one voter

in eight actually regards the political system as "completely broken". What to

do about rectifying the undoubtedly disturbing level of public unhappiness about

politics is more debatable - and ought to be widely debated. In this context,

however, there are two contrasting ways of looking at the five hours yesterday

that the Commons spent debating amendments to James Wharton's European Union

(referendum) bill, which obliges the government to hold an EU referendum by the

end of 2017.



One view, passionately held on the Conservative backbenches and in parts of the

Tory tribe, is that "giving the people a say" on Britain's membership of the EU

is precisely the sort of move that can restore public trust in politics in

general, and the Tory party in particular. The alternative view, pithily

expressed by Ed Miliband, is that five hours talking about Europe rather than

the cost of living is exactly the sort of thing that brings politics into

disrepute. It was a display, the Labour leader said, of the Tory party talking

to itself about Europe when the real issues facing the country lie elsewhere.



In that particular argument, this newspaper sides with Mr Miliband. The EU

referendum is undoubtedly a massive issue for many Tories, principally among

those who crave the opportunity to vote No to Europe. It is also a major

tactical issue across the party more generally as MPs seek to minimise the Ukip

effect in their constituencies in 2014-15. And Europe also has a toxic internal

significance as the party begins to contemplate its next leadership election

when David Cameron steps down, whenever that happens. Would-be successors are

already jockeying to appeal to party activists on Europe as a way of promoting

their leadership credentials. That process is likely to continue, whatever the

political circumstances.



Most other people, by contrast, rank Europe low on the list of agenda issues.

They are entirely logical and right to do so. When set alongside pressing issues

such as the economy, fairness, public spending, climate change, the state of the

schools and the health service, or even immigration, the EU relationship is

simply a less immediately important question, especially when the UK is not part

of the eurozone. The Tory party's preoccupation with Europe is a damaging

distraction. It is in some ways like the US Republican Tea Party's preoccupation

with reducing the size of the federal government - a collective obsession which

casts genuine doubt on their fitness to govern wisely in the national interest



This is absolutely not to say that everything in the European garden is rosy. No

one across the 28 member states can possibly pretend this is the case. Europe

remains economically unequal, with its fragile recovery underscored by the ECB's

interest rate reduction this week. It continues to grapple with its financial

and governance problems but not resolve them. It struggles to make its weight

felt in the world. It needs to deliver better. To that end it needs to be more

realistic about priorities, not least in the sobering absence of a new German

government and with Euroscepticism on the rise in many countries and likely to

be reflected in the European parliament elections next May.



European reform is a necessary task, not a hopeless one. Good political

leadership would stress the importance of Britain being engaged in these

processes, rather than pretending that withdrawal offers a serious alternative -

as Nissan's warnings yesterday underline. Both sides of industry grasp this more

clearly than the flag-waving political or media classes do. The Tory party does

itself no favours by the way it handles the EU issue. In one sense, that's fine

by us. But the Tory party's actions are harming the country, and that is not

fine at all.

Labour accused of 'gagging the people' over EU referendum



BYLINE: Andrew Sparrow Political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 424 words





The Conservatives accused Labour of trying to "gag the British people" yesterday

as opposition MPs used parliamentary guerrilla tactics to slow - but not block -

the passage of the Tory-endorsed backbench EU referendum bill through the House

of Commons.



After five hours of debate MPs managed to complete votes on just one of the four

groups of amendments tabled at the bill's report stage. MPs will resume the

debate on Friday 22 November and, with other backbench bills being held back,

James Wharton, the bill's sponsor, is hopeful that the bill will eventually

clear the Commons and get to the House of Lords.



In an unusual move for backbench legislation, Conservative MPs have been under a

three-line whip to support it, and Wharton praised his colleagues for their

"disciplined" approach in the chamber where, in an effort to speed up

proceedings, Conservatives kept their contributions to a minimum.



But although there were relatively few Labour MPs in the chamber - leader Ed

Miliband issued a statement saying the party was focusing on the "cost of living

crisis" instead - those Labour MPs present deployed tactics to drag out

proceedings. There were lengthy speeches from backbenchers such as Peter Hain,

Willie Bain and Mike Gapes (who tabled 57 amendments), copious interventions,

the calling of a division even though not a single MP voted against the proposal

and delays in the division lobbies, prompting Tory whip Claire Perry to accuse

Labour MPs on Twitter of "playing silly buggers".



Labour has criticised David Cameron's plan, which the Wharton bill would write

into law, to hold a referendum in 2017 on the grounds that announcing one so far

ahead creates uncertainty. Miliband has not ruled out supporting a referendum,

but is not expected to clarify his position until nearer the election.



Conservative MPs interpreted the filibustering as a deliberate attempt to deny

the electorate a vote on Europe. "There are some MPs on the Labour benches and

the Liberal Democrats who don't want to give people a choice on our membership

of the European Union," Wharton said. "We're going to do everything we can to

stop that from happening."



Adam Afriyie, another Conservative backbencher, said: "Labour are determined to

gag the British people."



During the debate Afriyie refused calls from his Tory colleagues to drop his

amendment to the bill calling for the referendum to be held in October 2014.

Back a vote on EU now or risk losing election, says Tory MP



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt, Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 10



LENGTH: 482 words





A Conservative backbencher whose allies have been running a campaign against

David Cameron is calling on Tory MPs to vote in favour of a referendum on

Britain's EU membership within the next year or risk "sleepwalking to election

defeat" as voters flock to Ukip.



As a new poll found that just over a third of Conservative party members support

an early referendum on the EU, the former frontbencher Adam Afriyie wrote to

Conservative MPs to say they have a "last chance" today to ensure a referendum

is held by October 2014.



Afriyie will table an amendment to a private members' bill, introduced by the

backbencher James Wharton, which will be considered by MPs at report stage.

Wharton's bill would ensure that a referendum on Britain's EU membership by the

end of 2017, in line with the prime minister's plans.



But Afriyie called on Tory MPs to support an earlier referendum to ensure the

party aligns itself with voters who would like the vote to be held before the

general election. He said that a referendum next October would allow the Tories

to draw a line under Europe, allowing them to hold a "straight fight" with

Labour on the economy at the 2015 general election.



"This Friday you will have the opportunity to vote for a 2014 EU referendum,"

Afriyie wrote in his letter published on the Guido Fawkes website. "This will be

the last moment to try to hold an EU vote within this parliament."



Afriyie's letter continued: "This is Conservative MPs' last chance to try to

secure a referendum. If we do not take this opportunity, we risk sleepwalking to

election defeat by driving votes to Ukip."



But the letter makes clear that Afriyie, who has failed to secure more than a

handful of supporters for his amendment, is struggling. He wrote: "I urge you to

vote for this amendment. At minimum, I would ask you not to vote against it."



He also addressed concerns that his amendment could upset the Wharton bill by

taking up precious time for the measure, which cannot be considered in

government parliamentary time. He wrote: "PS - I'm sensitive to concerns that

this amendment may take up valuable debate time and I will do my best to ensure

that is not the case."



Up to 20 Conservative MPs would like to support Afriyie's amendment. But it is

expected that it will fail because many hardline Eurosceptic Tory MPs fear

supporting his amendment could wreck the Wharton bill.



The intervention by Afriyie came as the ConservativeHome website found that 35%

of Conservative members would support a referendum next year. This was matched

by the number of people who would like a referedum to be held on Cameron's

timetable by the end of 2017.



But the poll of 700 Tory members found that 22% would like a referendum to be

held after October 2014 but before Cameron's target date of 2017.

Comment: Europe isn't lurching to the right. That's escapist fantasy: Our view

of European politics is coloured by Germany's terrible interwar years. But that

is no model for today



BYLINE: Martin Kettle



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 37



LENGTH: 1089 words





Until recently - the watershed came somewhere around the millennium - British

perceptions of modern German politics focused not on Germany's government or its

main political parties, which were boringly democratic and law-abiding, but on

the increasingly distant Nazi past and on extreme parties of the right, which

appeared to some eyes to threaten the return to street violence, domestic

authoritarianism and foreign aggression.



This perception said much more about the British than the Germans. In the end,

given a helpful push by the seriousness of the financial crisis and by the

pragmatic leadership of Angela Merkel, the pfennig has finally dropped. Today,

British perceptions now focus where they should have been all along - on the

resilience of Germany's postwar institutions and on the general good balance of

its society and economy in dealing with the problems it faces. It is part of

what gives me cautious hope about the outcome of any UK referendum on Europe.



But the conclusion to that is this: one down, 27 to go. That is because, reading

some of what is being written and said about the current state of Europe, it

feels as if we have been here before. What used to be said about Germany's

imminent lurch to the right is now often being said about Europe more generally.

Well, it was wrong then and, with certain provisos, it is also wrong now.



The current focus for fashionable doom-mongering is the European parliament

elections of May 2014. These elections, it is said, are likely to see a

far-right backlash across many EU countries. Some observers predict the collapse

of the EU itself, and even a new dark age of renewed competing European

nationalisms.



It would be foolish to dismiss all these possibilities in every respect, not

least because a lot can happen between now and the elections. And foolish, too,

to deny that across Europe these elections will be a major opportunity for

single-issue and extremist parties - not always the same thing - to make a play

for the support of insecure, disillusioned and plain angry voters in the 28

member states. Foolish, finally, because Europe has manifestly not dealt with

its banking and fiscal crises in either an even-handed or a sure-handed way.



Nevertheless, these warnings about an impending or a continuing lurch to the

right simply do not match the facts. For one thing, they assume that

Euroscepticism elides into far-right extremism, when sometimes it does not. For

another, far-right politics is far from homogeneous. Some parties passionately

defend the welfare state, while others see it as unworthy of a strong, manly

nation. All in all, though, the warnings about the far right amount to little

more than scaremongering.



Take the claim that the far right is prospering because of the economic crisis

and the relative failure to resolve it. The electoral evidence for this does not

exist. Yes, the National Front took 18% in the 2012 presidential election in

France and Golden Dawn twice polled 7% in Greece's two legislative elections

last year too. Both results were undoubtedly disturbing and newsworthy, and

parties of government in those two countries need to take them extremely

seriously. Yet they can hardly be portrayed either as triumphs or, in the case

of the National Front, as a high-water mark. They represent a challenge to the

system, not a threat. Thus far, moreover, they have been contained.



And look at the main elections in Europe this year, not last. In Cyprus the

nationalist anti-immigrant presidential candidate got 1%. In Germany, the

Eurosceptic AFD (by no means a party of the far right) got 4.7%, while the

far-right NPD scored 1% (its vote went down, not up). In Lombardy, the Northern

League's vote declined by 13%. True, the Freedom party took 21% in September's

Austrian general election and put its vote up, while the newly created Action

for Dissatisfied Citizens polled 19% in the Czech general election two weeks

ago. But the Freedom party has been higher in the past and Austria has survived,

and the Czech ADC is a party of the centre right that was formed to protest

against indigenous Czech political corruption, rather than the crisis in the

eurozone (of which the Czech Republic is not part).



None of this is to say that the elections will not provide an opportunity for

the right to do better. Something of the sort is almost certain in an election

which few voters take seriously, which favours protest votes and which tends to

have low turnouts. Even so, according to Cas Mudde, an academic specialist on

the subject, the far right is on course to gain 34 to 50 seats in the European

parliament, which is roughly 4% to 7% of the total. That's hardly a landslide,

even if you elide Euroscepticism and the far right together, which I do not.



Focusing on the real far right has an honourable history. But it is deeply

rooted in the terrible experience of interwar Germany. That is not a good model

for today. The reality is that no country in modern Europe is like the Weimar

Republic - and it is time we recognised that the political responses to today's

financial crisis are unfolding very differently to those of the Great

Depression.



Contrary to what is said by those who focus on the far right, the most striking

aspect of the modern crisis is the adaptability and resilience of existing

institutions, including the EU, in the face of huge pressures. That's not to say

the crisis has not had an effect. In some ways it has given an extra push to

trends that were already in evidence when the economy was booming. Nevertheless

in most countries, including Britain, most voters continue to vote for

traditional political parties, not new ones. And in most countries, also

including Britain, most people seem to prefer to give the existing system the

benefit of the doubt, albeit often with understandably bad grace. They are wise

to do so.



The real choice facing politics is not a grand global showdown between good and

evil, the old left and the old right. That's an escapist fantasy. The issue is

whether the existing centre left or the existing centre right is better and more

creative at building a coalition of interest around a confidence-inspiring and

practicable programme - and then keeping enough support get re-elected. Right

now in Europe, the centre right is proving a bit better at this than the centre

left. The hard graft for centre-left parties across Europe is to turn this

around - not to be a 21st-century Don Quixote forever tilting at 19th- or

20th-century windmills.

Comment: This US trade deal is a full frontal assault on democracy: Brussels has

kept quiet about a treaty that would let rapacious companies subvert our laws,

rights and national sovereignty



BYLINE: George Monbiot



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 33



LENGTH: 1061 words





Remember that referendum about whether we should create a single market with the

United States? You know, the one that asked whether corporations should have the

power to strike down our laws? No, I don't either. Mind you, I spent 10 minutes

looking for my watch the other day before I realised I was wearing it.

Forgetting about the referendum is another sign of ageing. Because there must

have been one, mustn't there? After all that agonising over whether or not we

should stay in the European Union, the government wouldn't cede our sovereignty

to some shadowy, undemocratic body without consulting us. Would it?



The purpose of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is to remove

the regulatory differences between the US and European nations. I mentioned it a

couple of weeks ago. But I left out the most important issue: the remarkable

ability it would grant big business to sue the living daylights out of

governments which try to defend their citizens. It would allow a secretive panel

of corporate lawyers to overrule the will of parliament and destroy our legal

protections. Yet the defenders of our sovereignty say nothing.



The mechanism through which this is achieved is known as investor-state dispute

settlement. It's already being used in many parts of the world to kill

regulations protecting people and the living planet.



The Australian government, after massive debates in and out of parliament,

decided that cigarettes should be sold in plain packets, marked only with

shocking health warnings. The decision was validated by the Australian supreme

court. But, using a trade agreement Australia struck with Hong Kong, the tobacco

company Philip Morris has asked an offshore tribunal to award it a vast sum in

compensation for the loss of what it calls its intellectual property.



During its financial crisis, and in response to public anger over rocketing

charges, Argentina imposed a freeze on people's energy and water bills (does

this sound familiar?). It was sued by the international utility companies whose

vast bills had prompted the government to act. For this and other such crimes,

it has been forced to pay out over a billion dollars in compensation. In El

Salvador, local communities managed at great cost (three campaigners were

murdered) to persuade the government to refuse permission for a vast gold mine

which threatened to contaminate their water supplies. A victory for democracy?

Not for long, perhaps. The Canadian company which sought to dig the mine is now

suing El Salvador for $315m - for the loss of its anticipated future profits.



In Canada, the courts revoked two patents owned by the American drugs firm Eli

Lilly, on the grounds that the company had not produced enough evidence that

they had the beneficial effects it claimed. Eli Lilly is now suing the Canadian

government for $500m, and demanding that Canada's patent laws are changed.



These companies (along with hundreds of others) are using the investor-state

dispute rules embedded in trade treaties signed by the countries they are suing.

The rules are enforced by panels which have none of the safeguards we expect in

our own courts. The hearings are held in secret. The judges are corporate

lawyers, many of whom work for companies of the kind whose cases they hear.

Citizens and communities affected by their decisions have no legal standing.

There is no right of appeal on the merits of the case. Yet they can overthrow

the sovereignty of parliaments and the rulings of supreme courts.



You don't believe it? Here's what one of the judges on these tribunals says

about his work. "When I wake up at night and think about arbitration, it never

ceases to amaze me that sovereign states have agreed to investment arbitration

at all . . . Three private individuals are entrusted with the power to review,

without any restriction or appeal procedure, all actions of the government, all

decisions of the courts, and all laws and regulations emanating from

parliament."



There are no corresponding rights for citizens. We can't use these tribunals to

demand better protections from corporate greed. As the Democracy Centre says,

this is "a privatised justice system for global corporations".



Even if these suits don't succeed, they can exert a powerful chilling effect on

legislation. One Canadian government official, speaking about the rules

introduced by the North American Free Trade Agreement, remarked: "I've seen the

letters from the New York and DC law firms coming up to the Canadian government

on virtually every new environmental regulation and proposition in the last five

years. They involved dry-cleaning chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, patent

law. Virtually all of the new initiatives were targeted and most of them never

saw the light of day." Democracy, as a meaningful proposition, is impossible

under these circumstances.



This is the system to which we will be subject if the transatlantic treaty goes

ahead. The US and the European commission, both of which have been captured by

the corporations they are supposed to regulate, are pressing for investor-state

dispute resolution to be included in the agreement.



The commission justifies this policy by claiming that domestic courts don't

offer corporations sufficient protection because they "might be biased or lack

independence". Which courts is it talking about? Those of the US? Its own member

states? It doesn't say. In fact it fails to produce a single concrete example

demonstrating the need for a new, extrajudicial system. It is precisely because

our courts are generally not biased or lacking independence that the

corporations want to bypass them. The EC seeks to replace open, accountable,

sovereign courts with a closed, corrupt system riddled with conflicts of

interest and arbitrary powers.



Investor-state rules could be used to smash any attempt to save the NHS from

corporate control, to re-regulate the banks, to curb the greed of the energy

companies, to renationalise the railways, to leave fossil fuels in the ground.

These rules shut down democratic alternatives. They outlaw leftwing politics.



This is why there has been no attempt by the UK government to inform us about

this monstrous assault on democracy, let alone consult us. This is why the

Conservatives who huff and puff about sovereignty are silent. Wake up, people

we're being shafted.

Britain must remain part of EU, says CBI



BYLINE: Katie Allen



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 24



LENGTH: 463 words





Britain's business lobby group will set out its "unequivocal" support for

Britain staying in the European Union today, claiming that membership brings

each household some £3,000 a year.



The CBI said a poll of members around the country showed the vast majority

wanted to remain part of the EU, subject to important reforms. At its annual

conference in London, the group will stress that benefits such as easier access

to export markets, both in Europe and further afield, easily outweigh the costs.



Presenting his "business vision for a reformed EU", CBI director general John

Cridland countered those calling for a so-called "Brexit" by stressing that

being outside the world's largest trading bloc would leave the UK isolated.



David Cameron has promised to put Britain's EU membership to a vote in 2017. The

referendum has caused huge controversy inside the Tory party, which is split

between those MPs who are pushing the prime minister for a vote before the 2015

election and a faction led by the former chancellor Ken Clarke, who has

described the vote as silly and reckless.



The CBI's research could strengthen Cameron's hand inside the Tory party,

especially as it found that more than three-quarters of small and medium-sized

businesses back staying inside the single market. Traditionally, polls have

shown large majorities among large businesses for EU membership against a large

no vote from smaller enterprises.



Cridland said: "We have looked beyond the political rhetoric to examine the pros

and cons of EU membership and British business is unequivocal: the single market

is fundamental to our future."



The group's conclusions credit membership of the bloc with giving Britain access

to European markets of 500 million people, helping cement the UK as the world's

leading financial centre and attracting investment from around the world. It

says that by aggregating research already available it has come up with a

conservative estimate that the benefits amount to 4-5% of GDP, or as much as

£78bn a year, making each household £3,000 better off.



But the group also outlines a number of frustrations. "The EU isn't perfect and

there is a growing unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. Europe

has to become more open, competitive and outward looking if we are to grow and

create opportunities and jobs," Cridland said.



The group is calling on the EU to fully implement a market for services and to

create a digital one, and also to secure trade deals with the US and Japan as

part of talks already under way. It also wants a moratorium on legislation where

there is a case for decisions to be made at national level, such as employment

law.

Comment: Europe's good for business: Fantasists on the right insist we should

cut adrift from this anchor. The opposite is true



BYLINE: Vince Cable



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 29



LENGTH: 623 words





For centuries, Britain has developed economically through being an open,

outward-looking country. Today, the economy has a high level of global

integration. The UK is the world's fifth largest exporter of goods and services,

and we attract more foreign direct investment than any other European country.



While I am more worried than Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England,

about the risks of becoming over-reliant on financial services for growth, I do

acknowledge that 60% of City-based firms are in London because of the single

market, and that is important to defend because of Britain's ability to

influence its rules.



However, it is clear that the UK's future prosperity will require us to adapt to

new realities. Over recent decades we have seen a rapid shift in the centre of

gravity of the world economy. The combined GDP of emerging economies has already

overtaken that of the west, and the gap is widening. Meanwhile, new technologies

are creating demand for greater investment in skills and infrastructure and

making it easier to relocate supply chains overseas.



There are fantasists on the right who dream of a lost world of global empire and

believe we can walk away from the successful trading block on our doorsteps. The

opposite is true. We should take careful note of today's report by the

Confederation of British Industry, which stresses the importance of continued EU

membership. Eight out of 10 firms surveyed said they would vote to stay in the

EU if there was a referendum tomorrow. The report estimated that each British

household derives annual benefits of about £3,000 a year from EU membership.

That compares with an annual net contribution per person of just over £110 to

the EU budget.



Significantly, the report concludes that far from acting as a constraint, the EU

serves to anchor the UK's global trade. By being part of a group that is

pursuing an outward-looking approach to trade, it is easier for British firms to

export and invest internationally. The best way to retain the UK's place as a

competitive economy is to work with like-minded European countries to maintain a

liberal approach to trade. There is now the prospect of a significant trade and

investment deal with the US, which could bring as much as £10bn to the UK

economy, and comparable trade agreements with Japan and India. By harnessing the

collective weight of the EU as the world's largest exporter, importer and

investor, there is the prospect of far better deals for British exports than we

could ever hope for alone.



Closer to home, we have to take the lead in completing the EU single market in

services and the digital and telecoms sector. Britain's 220,000 online retailers

already export more than the rest of Europe's e-retailers combined. Bringing the

EU single market into line with the internet age will allow us to build on these

strengths and open up a market of 500 million consumers to our online companies.

For those who complain about continental Europeans in our mix, it has to be

pointed out that the single market embodies four freedoms: trading goods and

services and freedoms of movement for capital and workers. That is what free

trade means.



There are, of course, regulatory barriers to business within the EU - as indeed

there are nationally. There is no justification for jettisoning important

environment, worker and consumer protections, but of course regulation should be

proportionate and moderate. The need for such reform is widely recognised across

Europe. The CBI report is a compelling business-based argument for the UK

remaining an active member of the EU. Millions of jobs and livelihoods depend on

it.

Cameron calls for HS2 rail project to cut costs after Labour pressure: PM asks

new boss to reduce £42bn budget: Miliband and Balls warn of soaring costs nearer

£50bn



BYLINE: Rowena Mason, Political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 582 words





David Cameron is to order the new head of the HS2 high-speed train line to cut

the cost of the £42bn project, just weeks after Labour said it would not give

the project a "blank cheque".



The prime minister will ask Sir David Higgins, the man in charge of overseeing

the Olympics, to bring in the north-south train line under budget after the

opposition raised concerns about its soaring cost and an official analysis

showed its value for money is falling. He will make the demands at a business

conference today, calling on Higgins to make sure he "maximises the benefits for

all parts of the country".



Cameron will also once again criticise Labour for wavering over the project, and

will argue that scrapping HS2 would "betray everyone north of Watford and

condemn Britain to the slow lane". However, his move to cut costs suggests Ed

Miliband has put him the back foot.



Last week Labour supported legislation giving millions of pounds to HS2 for

preliminary work, but the party has left open the possibility that it could

withdraw support in future.



Speaking at the same conference, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, will repeat

his reservations about the project and call for costs to be brought down, saying

the current bill is closer to £50bn. "We will take a hard-headed look at the

costs and benefits of the scheme to ensure this is the best way to spend £50bn

for the future of our country," Balls will say.



Both Cameron and Balls will make their remarks at the annual conference of the

CBI, the industry lobby group for big business, which has criticised Labour for

its proposal to freeze energy prices. However, the group yesterday gave a

cautious welcome to the opposition's plan to give tax breaks to companies that

offer a living wage, which at £7.45 (£8.55 in London) is higher than the minimum

wage.



John Cridland, the head of the CBI, told BBC Radio 5 that the scheme should help

at the margins and was to be applauded for being a carrot, not a stick.



The CBI is also due to release a new study suggesting membership of the European

Union is worth £3,000 to every household in the country, and that eight out of

10 firms would vote to stay in the EU if there were a referendum tomorrow.



Balls will make his strongest argument yet for a reformed Europe, with sources

saying Labour is preparing to push the PM to be more specific about how he would

like Britain's relationship with Brussels to change. The shadow chancellor will

say the UK is better placed to shape Europe's future if it is "fully engaged

rather than having one foot out the door".



Balls is likely to avoid giving any indication of whether Labour could back a

referendum but he will say the party will not take public support for Europe for

granted at a time when most people are seeing their living standards falling

year on year.



Writing in the Guardian today, the business secretary, Vince Cable, stresses the

importance of EU membership, as he attacks the "fantasists on the right who

dream of a lost world of global empire and believe we can walk away from the

successful trading block on our doorsteps". He says the CBI report shows six in

10 financial firms are based in London because of its position in Europe.



However, he writes that there is still a risk of the recovery being over-reliant

on the banks, saying he is "more worried than Mark Carney, the governor of the

Bank of England" about allowing financial services become too powerful.

Front: EU must unite against sceptics, says Italian PM: Europe must unite to

counter sceptics, says Italian PM



BYLINE: Lizzy Davies, Rome



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 1340 words





The EU's political mainstream must go into battle against a rise in populism

that next year threatens to usher in the "most Eurosceptic, most anti-European

parliament in history" and scupper hopes of long-term economic recovery, the

Italian prime minister, Enrico Letta, has warned.



Calling on leaders to confront the issue with less than seven months to go until

the European elections, Letta said the growing popularity of parties such as the

UK Independence party, France's National Front (FN) and Italy's

anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) was the "most dangerous phenomenon"

facing the European Union.



If they were to win more than 25% of the vote next May, he warned, it would be

the start of "very negative" trend that could have a potentially devastating

impact on the continent's potential for growth.



"I believe the risk of having the most anti-European European parliament in

history is being greatly underestimated," Letta told the Guardian and five other

European newspapers, characterising the challenge as a "great battle" between

"the Europe of the people and the Europe of populism".



The underlying issue facing the next parliament would be how to press ahead with

continent-wide economic recovery, he said.



"But if we want to move from the legislature of austerity to a legislature of

growth, and we find ourselves with the most Eurosceptic, most anti-European

parliament in history, this goal will be immediately crippled, halted."



After an unprecedented period of financial, currency and debt crises which has

seen Euroscepticism soar in some of the EU's major countries, voters in all 28

member states will go to the polls between 22 and 25 May to elect a new European

parliament that will sit until 2019. But fears are mounting among Europhiles

that, rather than the start of a new era of recovery, the election could saddle

the parliament with its biggest ever bloc of MEPs who have, to varying degrees,

anti-EU or anti-euro leanings.



One of the major focuses of pro-European concern is Nigel Farage's Ukip, which

has hopes of becoming the biggest British party, alongside Marine Le Pen's FN,

predicted by a French poll this month to win 24%, five points ahead of Francois

Hollande's Socialists.



Far-right parties in Poland, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria are expected to

perform better than 2009's election. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders's

anti-Islamic populism is doing well in the polls. Both the anti-euro Alternative

for Germany party and the anti-establishment M5S are expected to win their first

European seats.



Speaking from his grand office in the Palazzo Chigi, Letta said he had chosen to

"sound the alarm" over the elections because he could not see any co-ordinated

action aimed at tackling the rise in anti-EU populism.



"I see that, yes, it's being talked about in European countries, but timidly,"

he said. "And above all I do not see a European initiative to combat this trend,

this phenomenon, which seems to me to be the most obvious and most dangerous

phenomenon."



For arguably the first time, he said, he and others in Europe would be looking

closely at the results in Britain in May to see how Ukip performs.



"A success of Nigel Farage's party would have very negative effects on the

debate about Britain's exit from the EU.



"If one of the messages to come out of May's elections were that this party had

placed first, it would certainly be seen as a step towards Britain's exit," he

said, adding that he was "ferociously against" such a scenario. "On this issue

(Britain's exit) there is a bit of superficiality in Europe . . . This time, I

believe, it could really happen."



Letta, a Europhile who often speaks of his desire for a "United States of

Europe", said that, rather than retreating from the EU, the best way to avoid

further crises would be to reform European institutions to make them stronger.



"European citizens have to feel they are being represented by Europe and at the

moment there is clearly a problem. This, I believe, is the winning issue for

(M5S's Beppe) Grillo, for Farage, for Marine Le Pen, for all European populism -

that, to the question 'Who represents Europe? Who represents us in it?' the

response, unfortunately, is stuttering," he said, blaming the fragmented nature

of European institutions.



He said the lack of institutional infrastructure, especially for eurozone

countries, was an enormous problem and that the 17 - soon to be 18 - member

states should have their own economy minister. He also said that if he had a

magic wand he would merge the presidencies of the European commission and

European Council into one unified role.



In the months leading up to the election, said Letta - who is a former MEP -,

member states needed to unite to fight youth unemployment, which in Italy rose

to a record of 40.4% in September, according to official figures released

yesterday.



But it was the handling of the ever-thorny immigration debate that the

centre-left prime minister said could prove most decisive. "In many European

countries an ill-judged handling of the immigration issue will mean the European

elections will be lost," he warned.



Hitting out at Grillo, the former comedian and figurehead of M5S whose

anti-establishment politics lean to the right on some immigration issues, Letta

added: "It is not by chance that, in Italy, Grillo, who on many issues does not

take rightwing positions, has completely sent his compass spinning on this issue

. . . dividing his own MPs and a good part of his electorate because he knows

that Italy is a sympathetic and generous country with a very humanitarian

spirit, but in which the fear of difference is still a very big problem in

opinion polls."



Earlier this month, Grillo rebuked two of his senators for having put forward an

amendment to Italy's immigration laws after the Lampedusa boat tragedy in which

hundreds of African migrants died. The M5S is also against the reform of

citizenship laws that would make it easier for immigrants' children who were

born in Italy to officially become Italian.



The M5S has not taken part in the European elections before, but in February's

Italian election it made a spectacular breakthrough, winning 25% of the vote for

the lower house of parliament.



Grillo has repeatedly called for a referendum on Italy's membership of the

single European currency, though it is unclear to what extent that sentiment is

shared by his MPs and voters.



Letta, whose Democratic party (PD) was dealt a rude awakening by Grillo at the

polls in February, admitted that mainstream parties could not absolve themselves

of blame when confronted with the rising tide of populism. "I know that among

the 8 million people who voted for the M5S there are many voters who used to

vote PD and the moderate centre-right groupings," he said.



"If many voters who used to vote for our parties made populist choices, I think

we should be the first to question ourselves. In my opinion, 90% of the success

of populist parties in Italy is not down to European issues or economic

policies, but to a politics that took too much time renewing itself and cutting

costs."



To bring back voters from the M5S, he said, the Italian mainstream needed to

show it was "capable of reforming itself, and that (a storming of) the Bastille

is not necessary".



Letta - the head of a shaky grand coalition with Silvio Berlusconi's

centre-right grouping whose very creation was a cause of revulsion among many

former PD voters - said constitutional reform was essential in Italy to change

an electoral system he said would only serve to increase populism if it

continued.

Ireland: Low corporation tax not under threat, says PM



BYLINE: Henry McDonald



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 30



LENGTH: 159 words





Irish premier Enda Kenny has insisted that the Republic's corporation tax regime

is under no threat from German coalition talks, even though Angela Merkel's

potential coalition partners want the Republic's 12.5% rate put back on the EU

negotiating table.



He said: "It's very straightforward, it's a matter of national competence and is

not an issue." Pressed on whether Merkel could give him that assurance, Kenny

said: "The EU treaties have been adopted by a decison by the European Council,

by referendum. It is for each country to make its own decision."



Kenny said the government had restored Ireland's international reputation among

investors and the economy was still generating 3,000 new jobs a month. On

corporations using Ireland to pay little or no corporation tax, such as Google

and Apple, he added: "It requires an international response and we are at the

forefront of the European Council in saying there should be an international

response."

SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 41

In her piece on whether Labour should pledge an EU referendum (Comment, 16

October), Jackie Ashley says Ed Miliband shouldn't change position. However,

she, along with many other commentators, looks at it solely through the prism of

present and future electoral advantage, not principle. Miliband has always said

any decision on a referendum should be made on what's best for Britain - not

what's in the interests of David Cameron's Conservatives or any other party. All

those clamouring for a referendum are framing the debate as one of electoral

strategy, ignoring the impact such a blinkered outlook would have on our economy

and living standards. The uncertainty several years' wait for a referendum would

induce will be disastrous for jobs and growth, as companies wait to see if we'll

be in Europe before deciding whether to invest in our country, or pull out

altogether in the event of a No vote. It is these considerations that should be

at the heart of the debate, not short-lived poll bounces.

Comment: It's so tempting, but Miliband must not budge on Europe: The EU

referendum now poses a major dilemma. But to promise it would result in a

post-election defeat, and a UK exit



BYLINE: Jackie Ashley

British politics is hardening. The post-conference opinion polling reported by

the Guardian yesterday shows a strengthening in Labour and Tory numbers - both

overall, and in terms of determination to vote. To the extent that this is a

national snapshot, the nation is falling out of love with the idea of coalition.



This is cheering for Ed Miliband and his decision to take on the energy

companies - polarising, provocative "socialism" that the country seems to rather

like. But the new dynamic offers Miliband the biggest tactical dilemma of his

life. His answer could define British politics for years ahead - and it's got

nothing to do with the cost of living, one nation or hard-working people. It's

about Europe.



The return to left-right politics, which squeezes the Lib Dems, leaves the

Tories still facing their biggest problem: Ukip. Nigel Farage's party is as much

an angry annexe of the Conservative family as a new phenomenon. Combined with

unreformed constituency boundaries, Ukip voting in 2015 is still likely to rob

Cameron of any chance of an overall majority. If Miliband continues to radiate

an unnatural sense of calm, Ukip is an important part of the cause.



Yet there is one argument that could yet save Cameron's bacon and deliver a

Conservative majority, and it's a simple one, which won't gain full currency

until after next year's European elections: "Vote Ukip, get Labour" (because

splitting the Tory vote would let Labour in). Rightwing voters are desperate for

a European referendum but are bitterly hostile to Miliband; so the Tory message

that if you want a referendum, you must vote Conservative will have a lot of

resonance. So far Labour is talking about a referendum only if there is a major

transfer of powers to Europe. But could that change?



Of all the big tactical plays ahead, this is the big one. You haven't heard much

about it yet, but this is a very hot issue wherever key Labour people get

together in private. The influential backbencher Tom Watson said recently on

television that he might support the Tory rebels' call for an early referendum.

He is not alone.



And of course all of this goes way back in Labour history. The ghosts of Barbara

Castle and Peter Shore, never mind Hugh Gaitskell (and, for much of his life,

Harold Wilson), were never quite exorcised by the New Labour Europhiles. It was,

after all, Labour who gave the country the first European referendum.



Imagine the impact if Ed Miliband turned round now and made the pledge.

Hard-core rightwing voters would be free to vote with their hearts and Nigel

Farage; Cameron would have lost his key line of defence to his right. The Tory

party would be further ripped apart as hardcore Europhobes strove to respond by

trying to bring the referendum forward. Cameron's careful policy of a nuanced

renegotiation followed by a 2017 referendum with all the main parties lined up

in favour of staying in, would collapse. Sensation! If Ed thought he was

garnering some unexpected media support after his move on electricity prices,

this would take him into a whole new league.



Yet this is an Alice in Wonderland story, in which nothing is quite what it

seems. Imagine that Labour commits to a referendum, wins the election, and then

delivers its promise. At this point, of course, Ed Miliband has neither tried

for a renegotiation with Europe nor delivered one. The eurozone is still mired

in low growth and high unemployment. With the British right having just lost,

and seething, I just don't see how a referendum could be won for the

pro-European cause.



So . . . a new Labour prime minister inherits the aftermath of a no vote.

Whatever your views about the EU, the first thing that happens is economic

mayhem. Big companies decamp to Frankfurt or Paris. The pound falls. Many of our

exporters have no idea what's going to happen to them, and the banks aren't keen

to gamble in their favour. This would be an economic storm so big it could

overshadow anything else the new government would be trying to do. Ed would be a

one-term, unsuccessful prime minister.



Miliband will be all too aware of the risks involved. But he's receiving

different advice from people in his party. If Miliband went for a referendum, he

would win a short and spectacular tactical victory but at the price of yet more

bloody battles between the remaining Blairites and the current Labour

leadership.



It isn't worth it. As it happens, and perhaps paradoxically, I'd like to see a

European referendum. I've been arguing about this with friends for weeks - but

what I don't want to see is Labour rushing into a referendum promise, which

would result in us pulling out of Europe shortly after Ed Miliband reaches

Downing Street.



So in the end, all this is about confidence and the will to govern. If Miliband

genuinely thinks that he has the policies, the character and the disciplined

party to win a general election in 2015, then he will not offer an early

referendum. It's only if he really doesn't think he's going to make it without a

radical reshaping of the political landscape that he's going to be tempted. You

want to know what's really going on inside Ed's head? This is the decision you

need to watch for.

Comment: Superversion not subversion is the real threat to the state: Rightwing

politicians and their press use talk of patriotism to disguise where their true

loyalty lies: the wealthy elite



BYLINE: George Monbiot Twitter: @georgemonbiot A fully referenced version of

SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 33



LENGTH: 1044 words





Subversion ain't what it used to be. Today it scarcely figures as a significant

force. Nation states are threatened by something else. Superversion: an attack

from above.



It takes several forms. One is familiar, but greatly enhanced by new technology:

the tendency of spooks and politicians to use the instruments of state to

amplify undemocratic powers. We've now learnt that even members of the cabinet

and the National Security Council had no idea what GCHQ was up to. No one told

them that it was developing the capacity to watch, if it chooses, everything we

do online. The real enemies of state (if by state we mean the compact between

citizens and those they elect) are people like the head of MI5, and the home

secretary, who seem to have failed to inform cabinet colleagues about these

programmes.



Allied to the old abuses is a newer kind of superversion: the attempts by

billionaires and their lieutenants to destroy the functions of the state. Note

the current shutdown - and the debt-ceiling confrontation scheduled for Thursday

- in the United States. The Republicans, propelled by a Tea Party movement

created by the Koch brothers and financed by a gruesome collection of

multimillionaires, have engineered what in other circumstances would be called a

general strike. The difference is that the withdrawal of their labour has been

imposed on the workers.



The narrow purpose of the strike is to prevent the distribution of wealth to

poorer people, through the Affordable Care Act. The wider purpose (aside from a

refusal to accept the legitimacy of a black president) is to topple the state as

an effective instrument of taxation, regulation and social protection. The Koch

shock troops in the Republican party seem prepared to inflict almost any damage

in pursuit of this insurgency, including - if they hold out on Thursday - a US

government default, which could trigger a new global financial crisis.



They do so on behalf of a class which has, in effect, seceded. It floats free of

tax and the usual bonds of citizenship, jetting from one jurisdiction to another

as it seeks the most favourable havens for its wealth. It removes itself so

thoroughly from the life of the nation that it scarcely uses even the roads.

Yet, through privatisation and outsourcing, it is capturing the public services

on which the rest of us depend.



Using an unreformed political funding system to devastating effect, this

superversive class demands that the state stop regulating, stop protecting, stop

intervening. When this abandonment causes financial crisis, the remaining

taxpayers are forced to bail out the authors of the disaster, who then stash

their bonuses offshore.



One result is that those who call themselves conservatives and patriots appear

to be deeply confused about what they are defending. In his article last week

attacking the Guardian for revealing GCHQ's secret surveillance programmes, Paul

Dacre, the editor of the Daily Mail, characterised his readers as possessing an

"over-riding suspicion of the state and the People Who Know Best". Strangely,

this suspicion of the state and the People Who Know Best does not appear to

extend to the security services, whose assault on our freedoms Dacre was

defending.



To the rightwing press and the Conservative party, patriotism means standing up

to the European Union. But it also means capitulating to the United States. It's

an obvious and glaring contradiction, which is almost never acknowledged, let

alone explained. In reality the EU and the US have become proxies for something

which transcends national boundaries. The EU stands for state control and

regulation while the US represents deregulation and atomisation.



In truth, this distinction is outdated, as the handful of people who have heard

of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) will appreciate.

The European commission calls it "the biggest trade deal in the world". Its

purpose is to create a single transatlantic market, in which all regulatory

differences between the US and the EU are gradually removed.



It has been negotiated largely in secret. This time, they're not just trying to

bring down international trade barriers, but, as the commission boasts, "to

tackle barriers behind the customs border - such as differences in technical

regulations, standards and approval procedures". In other words, our own laws,

affecting our own people.



A document published last year by two huge industrial lobby groups - the US

Chamber of Commerce and BusinessEurope - explains the partnership's aims. It

will have a "proactive requirement", directing governments to change their laws.

The partnership should "put stakeholders at the table with regulators to

essentially co-write regulation". Stakeholder is a euphemism for corporation.



They want it; they're getting it. New intellectual property laws that they have

long demanded, but which sovereign governments have so far resisted - not least

because of the mass mobilisation against the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect

IP Act in the US - are back on the table, but this time largely inaccessible to

public protest.



So are data protection, public procurement and financial services. You think

that getting your own government to regulate bankers is hard enough? Try

appealing to a transnational agreement brokered by corporations and justified by

the deemed consent of citizens who have been neither informed nor consulted.



This deal is a direct assault on sovereignty and democracy. So where are the

Daily Mail and the Telegraph and the other papers which have campaigned so hard

against all transfers of power to the European Union? Where are the Conservative

MPs who have fought for an EU referendum? Eerie silence descends. They do not

oppose the TTIP because their allegiance lies not with the nation but with the

offshored corporate elite.



These fake patriots proclaim a love for their country, while ensuring that there

is nothing left to love. They are loyal to the pageantry - the flags, the

coinage, the military parades - but intensely disloyal to the nation these

symbols are supposed to represent. The greater the dissonance becomes, the

louder the national anthem plays.

Manufacturers say EU pullout would hit jobs



BYLINE: Heather Stewart



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 17



LENGTH: 263 words





Manufacturers are urging politicians to avoid jeopardising jobs and growth by

tinkering with Britain's relationship with the European Union.



In a survey of its members, manufacturers' group the EEF found that 85% said

they would vote to remain within the EU. Its chief executive, Terry Scuoler, has

written to David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, calling on them to focus

on making the European single market work better rather than flirting with an EU

exit.



Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should continue to be an EU

member by the end of 2017, and Labour is considering whether to include a

similar pledge in its election manifesto.



But Scuoler said: "Britain must not gamble on its future in Europe. It is naive

to think we can simply pull up the drawbridge and carry on as normal. The debate

must move on to how we can make Europe work to support jobs, growth and higher

living standards."



EEF members said there was a significant chance that they would shift investment

and employment plans in the event that Britain left the EU, while 60% said the

government should focus on enhancing competitiveness across the single market,

rather than on opt-outs from regulations.



Coalition ministers are encouraging Britain's businesses to look to emerging

markets as part of a drive to double exports to £1tn a year by 2020.



The EEF's intervention came as forecasting group the EY Item Club issued an

optimistic prognosis for the economy over the next two years. In its quarterly

forecast, published today, EY predicts GDP growth of 1.4% in 2013 and 2.4% next

year.

G2: Better the rebel you know: In sacking Diane Abbott, has Ed Miliband confused

disloyalty with dissent? After all, history shows it's better to keep an

outspoken critic close rather than push them to the margins. By Michael White



BYLINE: Michael White



SECTION: GUARDIAN FEATURES PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 1784 words





When Ed Miliband decided this week to sack Diane Abbott as shadow public health

minister, he must have given passing thought to the advice once offered by an

American master of political powerbroking. In 1971, President Lyndon Johnson

said of a dangerous rival: "It's probably better to have him inside the tent

pissing out than outside the tent pissing in."



It is a perennial dilemma for leaders when confronting or evading rivals. Do you

have them where you can see them - "hug them close", as Abraham Lincoln famously

did when he appointed to his cabinet all three of the men who felt they would

have made a better Republican candidate in 1860 (they were wrong). Or do you

drive them to the margins, or even exile or murder them, as Stalin did to

Trotsky and so many others?



Lincoln's crafty embrace was emulated by Barack Obama in making Hillary Clinton

his secretary of state in 2009 (it worked). Margaret Thatcher made the same

calculation over Tory "wets" such as Jim Prior and Ian Gilmour in 1979, though

she gently purged them when she felt stronger - as Churchill did the Men of

Munich in the years after 1940.



Yet dissent, edging into outright disloyalty, must be part of the process of

change in any organisation. Shakespeare noted that "if treason prosper none dare

call it treason". Worldly French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord

made the same point more bluntly: "treason is a matter of dates." Style is a

factor, too. In democracies it is sometimes safe to plot openly as long as the

declared agenda is policy, not personal ambition. Though a defeated leadership

rival, David Davis just passes this test: he quit Cameron's shadow cabinet on

sincerely held libertarian grounds.



But there are always risks. When Michael Portillo installed those extra phone

lines in readiness to challenge John Major - but then hesitated - he lost

doubly, just as David Miliband's hesitation damaged him when urged to face down

Gordon Brown in 2009: willing to wound but afraid to strike. That is an old

story, too, as Prince Hamlet learned the hard way.



Back in 1971, LBJ had been talking about J Edgar Hoover, founder director of the

FBI, whose ruthless campaign against all perceived forms of dissent had made him

more a subverter of the US constitution than its shield. Politicians of all

stripes - none better than Martin Luther King - knew what Hoover's files might

contain to damage or destroy them and he survived in post until his death in

1972 at the age of 77. Only then did his excesses emerge.



Abbott - the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington since 1987, and the first

black woman elected to parliament - is not quite in Hoover's league, let alone a

public figure who operates in the shadow. Quite the reverse. As a leftwing

backbencher, she was a natural rebel, a civil libertarian, keen to vote against

ID cards and overreaching counter-terror methods, but also against the Iraq war

and Trident missile renewal.



When Abbott ran for Labour leader after Brown's resignation in 2010 - the only

woman and ethnic minority face among four white men - her nominators included

David Miliband. She lost but was given her first frontbench role in recognition

of the vivacity and diversity she had brought to an otherwise vanilla contest.

An accomplished media performer, Abbott continued to make waves and was ticked

off by Ed Miliband last year for a tweet accusing white people of using "divide

and rule" tactics from the colonial era.



Now she is outside the tent the Labour leader can expect to hear even more from

TV's Diane as she exploits her new freedom and media status as a Miliband

martyr. Aides were not rushing yesterday to explain exactly why he had sacked

her. But the risks are obvious. Did he mistake noisy dissent, for instance

against his economic policies, for disloyalty - a common error in boardrooms,

football dressing rooms and families far removed from politics?



Damian McBride's new memoir sets out the parameters, and he regularly exceeded

them as Brown's spin doctor. Yes, there were policy disagreements between

Blairites and Brownites (McBride makes them sound more fundamental than proved

to be the case after Brown's succession), but this was basically a

personality-driven power struggle.



Brown felt Blair was a lightweight, a chancer who should fulfil his alleged

promise to stand down before the 2005 election. Blair knew the brooding Scot

would struggle to connect with voters. Most chancellors fight with No 10 over

the direction and detail of policy. But this went far deeper: a love-hate

relationship in which Blair gave Brown too much power and found himself unable

to claw it back.



Dissent or disloyalty? Disloyalty, on a huge scale, shockingly detailed by

McBride who had long since persuaded himself that Brown was "a political genius"

for whom any obstacle to power must be subverted and removed, often in collusion

with the Tory press. There was fault on both sides, which hobbled a reforming

agenda, but Brown's Nixonian insecurity was the most potent element.



With Thatcher it was quite different, but damaging in its own way. When she

ousted Ted Heath in 1975 after his second election defeat, he embarked on the

Great Sulk, but was too damaged ever to be a threat to her. Yet the consensual,

Keynsian, pro-European wing of her party barely bothered to hide its disdain for

her free-market policies, which they predicted would bring ruin.



In varying degrees Jim Prior, Norman St John-Stevas, Peter Walker (who never

made it personal and survived), Francis Pym and even gallant Lord Carrington

(who recently denied ever calling her "a fucking stupid, petit-bourgeois woman",

as claimed in Charles Moore's recent biography), criticised her regime in the

company of fellow MPs and eager political reporters. Even her deputy Willie

Whitelaw ("every PM needs a Willie," she said), once muttered that "she thinks

she's got a hotline to the Almighty. She hasn't."



Unsurprisingly for those days, their comments sometimes smacked both of snobbery

and sexism. Starting in 1981 with Gilmour and Stevas (who teasingly called her

"the Blessed Margaret" and the "Leaderene"), she purged them and installed the

loyal Tebbits and Ridleys. Michael Heseltine stormed out of cabinet in 1986 and

proceeded to attack her in full view - dissent that was disloyal but legitimate

because it was rooted in policy differences, openly and carefully expressed.

Hezza's speech on the party conference fringe became a setpiece of quasi-coded

criticism, like Brown's annual speeches as chancellor ("Labour is best when we

are LABOUR").



Heseltine always insisted he could "foresee no circumstances" in which he would

challenge for the leadership, a handily evasive formula vindicated when plodding

Geoffrey Howe, once a loyal Thatcher ally, now increasingly a dissenter,

resigned and delivered a brilliant 20-minute assassination speech. No one could

have foreseen that.



Thatcher thought she could save herself by meeting with cabinet colleagues one

by one. It was Thatcherites such as Peter Lilley who upset her most by telling

her she would lose. Disloyalty or realism? It remains a hard call but the

"illegitimate" way Thatcher was forced out poisoned her party in ways that

linger on. Now it was her turn to be disloyal to John Major - and she was.



Ken Clarke, who had waited until 1987 to get the cabinet seat his talents

deserved, made no bones of his opposition to her rule. When, later, the

Thatcherite rebels were in open revolt and Major was struggling to assert

himself over Europe, Clarke would say: "Any enemy of John Major's is an enemy of

mine." Straightforward talk that appealed to voters, but not to his party. Like

Labour's Denis Healey and the cerebral Iain Macleod, Clarke thus became another

great leader Britain never had.



When, in 1963, an ailing Harold Macmillan was forced out over the Profumo

scandal, Macleod and Enoch Powell simply declined to serve under Sir Alec

Douglas Home, whom party chiefs (no ballots then) preferred to "Rab" Butler, who

refused to fight for the crown. Loyal? Cowardly? Indecisive? Butler had been one

of those Munich Tories who denounced Churchill as "a half-breed American

adventurer" in May 1940 and muttered silkily against the Suez-doomed Anthony

Eden ("the best prime minister we've got") in the 50s. For all his talents the

character question always dogged him. Macmillan, who had been all for invading

Suez until it went wrong, became the first to pull the plug on the adventure.

Disloyal? Perhaps, but also decisive. He got No 10 as his reward.



With an election now looming, Miliband must calculate that even Abbott will not

rock the boat too hard. Taking away the party whip from rebels is a high-risk

option, that failed Major in 1995 and damaged Labour in the 50s when leftwing

Bevanite disdain for Hugh Gaitskell, Attlee's successor as leader, was such that

they repeatedly reinforced party splits - and lost three elections. David

Cameron has used the tactic sparingly: his mouthy "posh boy" critic Nadine

Dorries lost it for six months after running off to do I'm a Celebrity . . . in

Australia. But Dorries can push her luck, knowing that Ukip's Nigel Farage would

welcome her defection.



There was no celebrity TV in 1970 when the ex-Bevanite Harold Wilson was trying

for a third election win and the plotters were on the Labour right. Figures such

as Roy Jenkins and George Brown were personally contemptuous of their wily

leader, though it was Jim Callaghan's open challenge in resisting Barbara

Castle's trade union reforms that may have contributed more to Labour's defeat.



Callaghan succeeded Wilson in 1976, but reaped the whirlwind of union militancy.

Too weak to dismiss Tony Benn for persistent disloyalty from inside cabinet -

"Tony thinks this" chat spun by aides to reporters - he could only sideline him.

Bennery continued its destructive course until Neil Kinnock got a grip on

discipline in the mid-80s, midway through four successive defeats.



Labour rebels tempted to defy the Blair/Brown regime after 1997 only had to look

across the chamber at Eurosceptic Tory mayhem to (sometimes) draw back. That may

be Cameron's ace today. With self-declared leadership hopefuls such as Adam

Afriyie trying to force an early EU referendum, No 10 can afford to play him

long with no need to utter hollow threats.



Rebels are usually safer out in the open where everyone can see and judge them,

even if they are within the party tent - and still pissing inside.

Comment: Blairites don't really exist: The term is applied to politicians across

the spectrum, but suits none of them - not even Tony



BYLINE: Steve Richards



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 32



LENGTH: 758 words





The term "Blairite" is the most ubiquitous in British politics and also the most

misleading. We hear that Blairites want an apology to be made for the previous

Labour government's spending record, that Blairites are in despair about Ed

Miliband's opposition to immediate military intervention in Syria, Blairites

ached for the Blairite elder brother to come to the rescue and now fume about a

reshuffle that targeted Blairites. These Blairites are everywhere. In reality

they are nowhere. They do not exist.



Take the first point, that Blairites stand for George Osborne-style rigidity on

public spending. In all the epic internal rows inside the last government there

were very few over the level of public spending. Indeed it was Tony Blair who

announced on a TV sofa that UK spending on health would soar to the level of the

European Union average. At the time he had not worked out how the money would be

raised. Today's Blairites would despair at such recklessness.



After the 2005 election Blair wanted more public spending on Iraq and

Afghanistan, academies, law and order measures and public service reforms that

were costing a fortune to implement. If the Blairites are tough on public

spending, their founding father was not, for quite a lot of the time.



But who are the Blairites? David Miliband is often cited as one. Yet he came to

regard the war in Iraq as a "disaster" and was moved from his role as head of

policy in No 10 because he was not regarded as Blairite enough. He was replaced

by Andrew Adonis, who is often seen as the leading Blairite. Adonis is an

admirer of Blair, but his hero is Roy Jenkins, more recognisably a social

democrat and a passionate opponent of military intervention in Iraq. As a highly

effective cabinet minister Adonis nationalised a train company, developed plans

for high-speed rail and is now an advocate of an active industrial policy that

would have worried early Blair and perhaps later Blair too, on the grounds that

it might be seen, wrongly, as a return to the 1970s.



The shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, is sometimes described as a

Blairite. Yet when Blair was prime minister he spoke critically and insightfully

about the dangers of "Blairite exceptionalism", the idea that a party supposedly

on the centre-left can only win with a leader who seeks definition against it.

Alexander was the architect of the Commons' vote against immediate military

action in Syria, an act that alarmed Blair. The Blairite Alexander disagreed

with Blair on one of the most contentious issues of recent times.



There are self-proclaimed Blairites in the Conservative party too. Michael Gove

never loses the opportunity to declare that he is one. Yet Gove recently told a

BBC interviewer that if there were a referendum now on the UK's membership of

the EU he would vote to leave. Blair is such a passionate supporter of British

membership of the EU that he hoped to become its president. On another of the

biggest issues of our times, the Blairite Gove is at the opposite end of the

argument to Blair.



Recently I read that Nick Clegg is the Blairites' new hero, and yet the Blairite

Adonis is a staunch critic of Clegg, regarding him as a Conservative.

Nonetheless Clegg speaks, like Blair, of his support for social justice and

economic competence. But then again part of Blair's genius was to make the banal

seem profound. The key debate for those who delve more deeply is over the means

to agreed ends. More widely there are big differences between the two. Blair was

an authoritarian in some respects, supporting a series of measures that

constrained civil liberties. Clegg's support for civil liberties is such that he

has put the eccentric Norman Baker in the Home Office. When Clegg stood in for

Cameron at prime minister's questions he made waves by describing the war in

Iraq as illegal.



In the media there is an army of Blairites, but study them closer and the same

maze of divergent views arise. Blair's biographer John Rentoul is seen as the

ultimate Blairite. Yet Rentoul is a Eurosceptic who believes that Ed Balls'

Keynesian interpretation of economic policy in 2010 was broadly correct.



There are some in the Labour party who agree more with Cameron and Osborne than

with Miliband. They are on the centre-right without quite realising it. But a

lot of those mentioned here have moved on from the 1970s and 80s, the

election-losing decades that shaped Blair's approach to politics. None of them

are Blairites, not even Blair.

&#10002;So many are nervous about the prospects for fracking in Britain. What is

the potential, what are the dangers? Difficult choices, but none of this seems

to be keeping energy minister Michael Fallon awake at night. He seems to be

quite enjoying everyone else's agony.



Two months ago he was joking about the prospects for fracking in the south-east,

suggesting quite a few "rectory walls" might bear the brunt. More recently he

was to be found undermining once again PM Dave's claim to run the greenest

government ever. When Fallon, speaking at a party conference fringe meeting,

mentioned the UK's "strong environmental and climate change commitments", a

heckler shouted: "Scrap them!" To which Fallon quietly replied: "It would be my

luck to scrap them." Which raises the question, is this the sort of thing he

says when he meets Cuadrilla, the fracking company? Hard to tell, and there is

no point asking his department. Responding to a freedom of information request,

the Department of Energy said it "can confirm that Mr Fallon met Cuadrilla on 24

June 2013". But it can't confirm anything that was said because "there is no

recorded note of the meeting". Seems a strange way to deal with a matter quite

so sensitive. But he probably cracked more jokes, as is his way.



&#10002;More bloodletting in the Tory party as the stalking horse that never

was, Adam Afriyie, breaks cover again to cause PM Dave discomfort by calling for

an early EU referendum. This provokes much angst and a measure of backbiting

among honourable members, each of them figures of high principle. Take Philip

Davies, the Tory MP for Shipley. He's one of our favourites as you know, as

parliamentary spokesman for the Campaign Against Political Correctness and the

man who wonders why anyone complains when white performers black up. According

to the Sun, one of his favourite mouthpieces, he's taking a sensible approach to

Afriyie's latest intervention. Davies, said the paper, criticised Afriyie, but

also admitted he could support him. "I think he's being utterly self-indulgent

and trying to boost a leadership bid." Nevertheless, "I believe in a referendum

so I'm not saying I won't vote for it." This is why he is so dear to the good

folk of Shipley.



&#10002;Another firm diary favourite, Dr Liam Fox, also finds himself harshly

spotlighted. Hard hearts let it be known to the scurrilous press that the

potential party leader claimed 3p on his expenses for a 100-metre car trip.

Extraordinary that such an event should occur, especially as he once boasted to

author Dominic Shelmerdine that, unlike his colleagues, his medical training

bestowed upon him "a sense of perspective, something that is sadly all too

lacking in politics". A beacon indeed. Would that they all could see the world

like him.



&#10002;One never tires of a literary feud, and luckily there seems to be an

endless supply. Generating both heat and light of late, the fisticuffs between

Salman Rushdie and the American Jonathan Franzen. "Franzen has recently attacked

you for using Twitter," said the French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, in

conversation with the great man. "I feel like I've been bitten by a mosquito,"

replied a waspish Rushdie. "No, seriously, he's a very good writer. But I think

he should mind his own business. Of course he has every right not to appreciate

social networks. If he doesn't want to use Twitter, that's his affair. But let

him not come and tell me what I ought to be doing!" Salman has been pushed

around enough for one life, it seems.



&#10002;Interesting times, finally, for Jon Benjamin, the British ambassador to

Chile. A lot on his diplomatic plate, including the country's role combatting

climate change, opening the channels for British business, and bolstering our

steadfast attitude towards the Falklands. And then for Our Man in Chile, there

was that bilateral meeting with the black-eyed biter of bat's heads, Ozzy

Osbourne. Benjamin has been tweeting about it and parading the picture. "How to

sum up a Black Sabbath gig in one word," he says. "LOUD! But a conversation with

Ozzy - not loud." Heroes fall short in all sorts of ways.

Clegg accepts EU referendum but warns UK against leaving



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt, Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 12



LENGTH: 482 words





Nick Clegg will today call for the rules of the EU's single market to be

rewritten to allow Britain and other countries outside the eurozone to be

allowed to block changes proposed by members of the single currency.



In a major speech on the EU, the deputy prime minister will say that he now

expects a referendum on Britain's EU membership to be held in the coming years.



The deputy prime minister will warn that leaving the EU would be "economic

suicide". But he will indicate that the Liberal Democrats might be able to find

common ground with the Tories in negotiations on the future of the EU.



David Cameron has said that Britain will fight hard to protect the single market

if the Lisbon treaty is amended to allow eurozone members to underpin changes to

the governance of the single currency. Clegg will make clear that he shares the

prime minister's view that no member state should have a veto should be amended

to ensure that the 17 eurozone members cannot force through changes against the

will of the countries outside the single currency.



Clegg will say: "Next time there is treaty change I will advocate new safeguards

guaranteeing that - whenever a reform might impact on the single market -

Euro-ins and Euro-outs have an equal say."



His proposals are drawn from the successful Treasury negotiations over the EU's

banking union. George Osborne and Cameron succeeded in introducing a double

majority rule which meant that no change could be introduced without the consent

of euro and non-euro member states.



In his speech Clegg will say that he thinks Cameron is wrong to propose a

referendum on an arbitrary timetable in 2017. He will say that the Lib Dems

still believe that a referendum should only be held if there is a change in the

relationship between Britain and the EU.



But the deputy prime minister will make clear that he expects a referendum will

be held. He will say: "The parties differ on the timing. The Conservative party

want one in 2017 : it's a date chosen for internal party management as much as

anything else. The Liberal Democrats believe it will be far better to have the

referendum when a serious change to Europe's rules, affecting the UK, arises.

But we all agree that it will happen at some point or another."



Clegg is highly critical of Tories and others who want to leave the EU. He will

say: "Let me be absolutely clear: leaving the EU would be economic suicide. You

cannot overstate the damage it would do to British livelihoods and prosperity.

Three million British jobs are linked to the single market . As a member we are

part of the world's biggest borderless market place, made up of 500 million

people. It's now the largest economy in the world - ahead of the United States -

and it's where we do around half of all our trade."

Rebel Tory MP calls for EU referendum before 2015 election: Downing St rejects

poll 'under any circumstances': Tory Eurosceptics appeal for party unity



BYLINE: Rowena Mason, Political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 781 words





A rebel Tory plot to force David Cameron to hold an EU referendum next year

backfired yesterday, after it was pilloried by most Conservatives.



Adam Afriyie, the Conservative MP for Windsor, called for a vote on Britain's

membership of the European Union on 23 October next year, rather than the

official Conservative promise to hold a poll before the end of 2017.



Afriyie, who was rumoured to be behind a plan to oust the prime minister earlier

this year, said he would not be able to sleep at night if the public were not

given a say on the issue before the election. To achieve an early vote, he is

planning to table an amendment to the EU referendum bill, which is supported by

the Tory leadership.



Within hours, it became clear he had hit the wrong note, as some of the most

eurosceptic MPs in the party pleaded with him to reconsider his position for the

sake of unity. The only vocal supporter was Tom Watson, the Labour backbencher

who said he would probably vote with Afriyie. "I think there are a lot of people

who think we need clarity on this now," he said.



The Labour party also refused to rule out backing the amendment, despite Chuka

Umunna, the shadow business secretary, saying the party does not agree with the

Tory plan for a referendum on the basis of a renegotiation on Britain's

relationship with the EU that has not yet happened. Labour has refused to set

out its thinking on whether an EU referendum is necessary but it is possible Ed

Miliband could use Afriyie's amendment to derail the bill.



Asked how Labour will vote, a senior party source said: "We will respond to the

amendment after it is published."



Some Labour figures believe backing an early vote could cause bitter divisions

on the Tory benches before the election as well as settling the issue once and

for all. One of the party's MPs also pointed out any parliamentary time spent on

Afriyie's amendment increases the chance the Conservative-backed EU referendum

bill will be "talked out". This is the technical term for when legislation

proposed by a backbencher is killed off because it has run out of its allotted

time for discussion.



Afriyie's challenge, laid out in an article for the Mail on Sunday, also gave

Labour another chance to accuse the Conservatives of dithering over Europe when

they should be addressing the economy and living standards.



Michael Dugher MP, a shadow cabinet minister and Labour vice-chairman, said it

was a sign "the Tories are back to obsessing about the European Union".



Afriyie's amendment provoked a furious reaction from the Conservative

leadership, with Downing Street saying a referendum would not be allowed to take

place next year "under any circumstances".



Theresa May, the home secretary, also slapped down the plan, telling the BBC's

Andrew Marr Show, "Adam's got it wrong" and could "possibly jeopardise the

bill".



Yesterday, dozens of Tory MPs lined up to criticise Afriyie for disrupting the

short-lived Conservative consensus on Europe.



Cheryl Gillan, a former Conservative cabinet minister, warned Afriyie's move

would play into Labour's hands.



"I do take issue with him taking this up at this particular time," she told the

Murnaghan programme on Sky News. "I think he's jumping the gun here. I think

Labour would be very happy for this referendum to take place next year because

they wouldn't have to make a decision."



Chris Heaton-Harris, MP for Daventry, said he had only been in parliament three

years, but knew the Afriyie amendment would "make a referendum less likely",

while Nick de Bois, MP for Enfield North, who wants to leave the EU as things

stand, said the timing was wrong.



"No government can hope to influence and reach agreement with EU members on a

renegotiated, less intrusive but more pro-single market European Union within a

year," he wrote on the ConservativeHome website. "Neither can we hope to

stimulate public engagement that will help to decide if we leave or remain.



Meanwhile, Sarah Wollaston, MP for Totnes, said she thought it would "scupper

opportunity for renegotiation".



Afriyie stuck to his argument that a referendum before the election is needed

because the British public is "suspicious" about whether it will happen.



"This is about every MP searching their conscience and asking: do they want to

agree with 80% of the population who want a referendum in the bag," he told Sky

News. " This is nothing to do with me and David Cameron. It is to do with me and

my conscience, making sure that I, as a backbench MP, make sure that parliament

has the option to decide whether to have a referendum in 2014."

Conservative whip and rising star quit ahead of reshuffle: No 10 announces

Randall and Smith's departure: Rebel bid to bring forward EU referendum falters



BYLINE: Rowena Mason, Political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 764 words





David Cameron's long-serving deputy whip, John Randall, and his youngest

minister, Chloe Smith, have resigned ahead of a reshuffle in which the prime

minister is expected to promote a number of women.



Downing Street made the surprise announcements late last night, sparking

speculation that Cameron will shake up junior roles within his team as early as

today. They follow the resignation of transport minister Simon Burns, who wants

to stand as deputy Commons speaker.



Randall, who has served in the Tory whips' office for 13 years, said he informed

the prime minister last year that he wanted to return to the backbenches. He is

best known for his role in the resignation of his boss, Andrew Mitchell, the

former chief whip, over the "plebgate" scandal just over a year ago.



In his resignation letter, Randall assured the prime minister that he would

continue to do "whatever I can for you personally as well as for the party, the

government and of course the country".



"I know that it is customary to write at these times that it has been a great

privilege and honour to serve as a member of the government, but it really has

been that and a lot more," he wrote.



Cameron's reply to Randall was glowing, describing him as a "rock" for the

whips' office and the party. "It sounds dramatic, but I had rather hoped this

day would never come," Cameron wrote. "I could not have wished for a more loyal,

discreet, patient, trustworthy and committed colleague over the last eight

years."



Smith, a Cabinet Office minister, is stepping down to concentrate on her

constituency work and engaging young people in politics. The 31-year-old MP, who

has previously served as a whip and a Treasury minister, has recently been

overseeing the lobbying bill, which has been criticised as posing a potential

threat to freedom of speech. She was moved from the Treasury in the last

reshuffle after a difficult interview on BBC Newsnight about the chancellor's

deferral of fuel duty.



Last night, Smith, the MP for Norwich North, told the Guardian: "It's entirely

my own decision and something I see as very positive. Anyone who has known me

and my work has known that my constituency comes first. I've spent three of my

four years serving as a minister. I'm very proud of that and achieving things

like helping to save £10bn pounds of Whitehall waste. But for now I want to

focus on the things that really matter to me."



In her letter to Cameron, she said: "As you know, I was only 27 when I was lucky

enough to be elected as an MP. I would welcome the opportunity to develop other

ways of giving public service, both inside and outside parliament, while

continuing to work hard for my constituents."



The prime minister's reply said Smith has served "ably" and made a "positive

impact". "I know this will not have been an easy decision for you to make, and

one you will have given a huge amount of thought to," he said. "After serving

the government so ably for over three years, you will certainly be missed, but I

completely understand and respect your decision."



The Tory reshuffle could happen at the same time as Ed Miliband shakes up the

Labour frontbench. He is thought to be considering moving Andy Burnham, the

health secretary, and Liam Byrne, the work and pensions secretary, with Rachel

Reeves, a Treasury minister, tipped for promotion.



The news came at the end of an embarrassing day for the Tories, as a rebel plot

to force Cameron to hold an EU referendum next year was rejected by most

Conservatives. Adam Afriyie, the Conservative MP for Windsor, called for a vote

on Britain's membership of the European Union next October, pre-empting the

official Tory promise of a poll before the end of 2017. Afriyie, who was

rumoured to be behind a plan to oust the prime minister earlier this year, said

he would not be able to sleep at night if the public were not given a say on the

issue before the election. He was planning to table an amendment to the EU

referendum bill, which is supported by the Tory leadership.



But within hours, it became clear that he had hit the wrong note, as some of the

most eurosceptic MPs in the party pleaded with him to reconsider his position

for the sake of unity. The only vocal supporter was Tom Watson, the Labour

backbencher, who said he would probably vote with Afriyie. "I think there are a

lot of people who think we need clarity on this now," he said.

* Reshuffles in the major parties brought about a momentary role reversal in our

coverage of the expected changes. In some editions we said: "As for the more

senior posts, Cameron is thought to be considering moving Andy Burnham, the

health secretary, and Liam Byrne, the work and pensions secretary, with Rachel

Reeves, a Treasury minister, tipped for promotion." That confused Cameron with

Miliband and shadow positions with government ones (Conservative whip and rising

Conservative conference, Manchester 2013: Leadership rivals: PM and mayor close

ranks: 'We're quite well-alligned'



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt and Rowena Mason



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 11



LENGTH: 636 words





David Cameron has signalled a "concordat" with Boris Johnson over the London

mayor's return to parliament at the next election in 2015, according to the

author of a new book on the coalition.



After the prime minister said he would "absolutely" welcome Johnson's return to

parliament a year before the end of his second term as mayor in 2016, Matthew

d'Ancona said Cameron had accepted the inevitable.



Johnson signalled a more constructive relationship with Cameron when he launched

a strong defence of the prime minister in his speech to the Tory conference. He

said Cameron was best-placed to secure a referendum on Britain's EU membership,

and called on Tories to "work flat-out" to help the prime minister win a

majority at the next election that would "cut that Liberal Democrat albatross

from around our necks".



But Johnson made a joke at Cameron's expense as he recalled a visit by Alain

Juppe, who was mayor of Bordeaux while serving as French prime minister. "That

is the kind of thing they do in France - a very good idea," he said, before

adding: "Joke, joke, joke, joke."



Johnson addressed the conference after Cameron said he would warmly welcome the

mayor's return to parliament in 2015 even though his second term at City Hall

runs until 2016. The prime minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he

"could make a very strong team together" with Johnson, despite all the

speculation about the mayor's leadership ambitions.



"I've had this conversation with Boris and my message to him is: 'You're a

brilliant mayor of London, you've done a great job, you've got a lot more to

give to public life and it would be great to have you back in the House of

Commons at some stage contributing to public life.' But that's up to him, but

I'll certainly be giving him a warm welcome."



Asked whether Johnson could stand again while still London mayor, Cameron said:

"Absolutely, but that's a matter for him, it's his plan, so all I know is that

he's a massive asset to the country, a big asset to the Conservative party, we

could make a very strong team together, we do today. Obviously, this is all

dependent on what Boris wants to do, whether he wants another term, whether he

wants to become an MP. I think he's got an enormous amount to give to public

life and I don't think he's given up on that either, so we're quite

well-aligned."



D'Ancona, author of In It Together and a former Spectator editor, told Today:

"There had to be a concordat between Boris and Cameron sooner or later. You can

see the lineaments of one emerging now.



"Cameron is clearly not only accepting the idea that Boris might come back as an

MP in 2015 but actually encouraging it. He is hugging him close. There is a

logic in this. It is better to be seen to be in favour of something that is

probably going to happen anyway than to be against it and then watch it happen

against your will."



In his speech, Johnson was generally supportive of Cameron. But he made clear he

would not budge on his opposition to a third runway at Heathrow and his belief

in the need for a larger hub airport in the Thames estuary. George Osborne hopes

to prepare the way for a third Heathrow runway by setting up a commission that

will report after the election.



Johnson said: "If we persist with the Heathrow option we will wreck the quality

of life for millions of Londoners, we will constrain London's ability to grow

and we will allow the Dutch to continue to eat our lunch by allowing Schiphol

into the hub for London."

Comment: Of Faust and Farage: The cost of a Tory-Ukip pact would be the chance

for wider appeal sold for illusory political gain



BYLINE: Nick Herbert



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 32



LENGTH: 661 words





'Tories: back to the workhouse." So screamed the front page of yesterday's Daily

Mirror, the self-described "intelligent tabloid". It's a commonplace that

politicians are divorced from the real world. But there's no bigger divide than

between the public, who see for themselves the effects of excessive welfarism

and foot the bills, and metropolitan commentators, who regard all welfare

provision as beyond criticism.



For too long growing public concern about excessive levels of immigration and

welfare dependency was ignored by mainstream parties. It is partly from this

void that Ukip has risen. It is a mistake to believe that the party is some kind

of provisional wing of shire conservatism. Ukip is appealing to voters from

across the political spectrum.



The correct response for the Conservative party is to address the concerns of

people who are anxious about their jobs and living standards. That means

distinguishing between disaffected voters and the demagogues who are appealing

to them. We need to speak for people who are worried about their future, not

against them. Policies to control immigration, reform welfare and reduce taxes

aren't a sudden response to an insurgent minority party. They are core to a

government that puts itself on the side - to coin the Conservative party's

conference slogan - of hard-working people.



But there are far more voters to win back who have moved to Labour, or away from

all parties, than to Ukip. That is one reason why the suggestion of a pact with

the minority party is so misguided. Nigel Farage complains he is regarded as a

"plague carrier" by Tory high command because he is refused entry to the

Conservative party conference. But it would indeed be political death for

Conservatives to open the door to him.



The first obstacle is a glaringly obvious policy difference. Ukip want to leave

the EU come what may. That is not Conservative party policy, which is to

renegotiate Britain's terms of membership and put a better deal to the public in

a referendum. And while Ukip now offers a small menu of populist, frequently

incredible policies, its gravitational pull is to talk ceaselessly about Europe,

which would be disastrous for Conservatives when Europe is relatively low on

voters' concerns.



There are other reasons to reject Farage's overtures. Ukip is an angry party. It

oozes a loathing of contemporary Britain. It is backward-looking and

isolationist. A bargain with Ukip would be Faustian, the opportunity of wider

appeal sold for illusory political gain. Like two bitter old bores drinking

together in a pub, no one else would want to talk to us.



It's true that the Conservative party needs to reach out beyond its core to

obtain a winning share of the national vote, but the overture should be to

electors in the north, to women, to ethnic minorities, to a generation who are

working ever harder for seemingly less reward.



This is the grand coalition that Conservatives must forge. At its most powerful

the party has appealed beyond the shires to the cities, to those who want to get

on as much as those who have already succeeded, to the young as well as the

elderly. It has captured an optimism about our country, rewarded aspiration and

challenged privilege.



The spring in the step of Conservative activists this week comes from a sense we

are winning the big argument about the economy. Ultimately a debate about living

standards will run best for the party which can offer a credible path to

economic growth, jobs and rising incomes.



Conservatives should realise that we have a powerful hand to play. We are

setting out policies which can speak to anxious voters and win them back. We

should not be deterred by shrill claims that to address the electorate's biggest

concerns, such as welfare dependency, is to abandon the middle ground. Nor

should we be spooked into any kind of deal with a minority party that would

drive moderate voters away.

Conservative conference, Manchester 2013: Cameron bans MPs from pacts with Ukip

as Farage crashes conference: 20 Tories said to be ready to stand on joint

ticket: PM forced to rule out prospect of local deals



BYLINE: Rowena Mason, Political correspondent

LENGTH: 624 words





Conservative MPs have been banned from teaming up with Ukip at the next

election, as Nigel Farage claimed more than 20 Tories would like to stand on a

joint ticket.



David Cameron was forced to rule out any prospect of local pacts or deals after

the Ukip leader gatecrashed the second day of the Conservative conference.



Despite drawing large crowds, including several Conservative MPs, Farage's

attendance in Manchester was overshadowed by a fresh race row.



Gawain Towler, a Ukip aide and MEP candidate, described a British Asian female

reporter as being "of some form of ethnic extraction" in a text message sent to

the wrong person.



However, the party shrugged off the incident as a mistake, Towler said he had

become "today's comedy racist" and Farage insisted it was "not meant

maliciously".



The Ukip leader was banned from the main conference venue and airbrushed from

the schedule, but several Conservative MPs pleaded with Cameron to "work

together" with Ukip to keep out Labour.



Their pleas came as the Bow Group thinktank suggested Ukip could be bigger than

the Tories within five years at its current growth rate.



One Eurosceptic Tory MP, Bill Cash, shared a platform with Farage and begged him

to "lay off" his assault on 60 Conservative marginal seats that could be lost if

Ukip's poll surge continues.



Cash asked Farage to stop fielding candidates against Tories as they should be

"allies, not enemies" given their common aim of having an EU referendum.



However, Farage dismissed this "hopelessly out-of-date, tribal" view, as Ukip

believes it will get enough Westminster seats to hold the balance of power and

demand a referendum in 2015.



He said it was not in Ukip's interest for Cameron to get a second term as the

prime minister treated Farage's supporters like "members of the lower orders".



He said no Ukip candidate would stand aside for a Tory, unless local parties can

strike formal "joint ticket" agreements with potentially sympathetic MPs such as

Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg.



The Ukip leader later said his "eclectic" band of supporters would be deeply

unhappy if he ever "sold out" by agreeing to go easy on Conservative candidates.



He declined to say whether he would prefer Ed Miliband or David Cameron to be in

charge, but said he had "some time in many ways" for Boris Johnson.



Farage's presence appeared to infuriate senior Conservatives, with Cameron,

George Osborne, Theresa May and Grant Shapps all forced to bat away the idea of

joint Tory-Ukip tickets.



Osborne said: "There aren't going to be any deals with Ukip and there are not

going to be Conservative-Ukip candidates locally. The only candidates who will

stand for the Conservative party at the election are Conservative candidates - a

sort of statement of the obvious."



Lynton Crosby, the Conservative election guru, also made it clear the party will

not respond to Ukip's offers.



Asked how the party would react to the threat of Ukip, he told the BBC in a rare

interview that there would be no change in policy as a result of Farage.



Boris Johnson, the London mayor, appeared to take Farage's presence in better

humour, as he joked "you kip if you want to, David Cameron's not for kipping".



One MP, Anne Main, stormed out of Farage's first speech, saying she would not

listen to "this rubbish" and accusing him of "party political stunts".



Others were much more interested in Farage's offer. Douglas Carswell, MP for

Clacton, wrote on the Telegraph website that he is "strongly in favour of Ukip

and Conservatives working together where they share the same vision of an

independent Britain".

Holy Spirit of Conservative modernisation keeps the faith: Francis Maude defends

his legacy in the face of hardening attitudes on the right



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 13



LENGTH: 977 words





It has been said that in the original Holy Trinity of Tory modernisers Michael

Portillo is the Father, Michael Gove the Son and Francis Maude, the Holy Spirit.



Portillo has fled the field, Gove is wrestling with "the blob" of the education

establishment, but Maude remains, keeper of the modernising flame.



Yet a cursory scan of the announcements at the upcoming Tory conference -

crackdowns on welfare and immigration - might suggest this is not a golden age

for modernisers. The shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander claims the

conference will represent "the final nail in the coffin of Conservative

modernisation".



A tax break for married couples is likely to be one of the policy highlights,

the kind of traditional social judgment that was anathema to modernisers.



Driven to the right by austerity, his backbenchers and the threat of Ukip, David

Cameron has appointed the Australian pollster Lynton Crosby to run his 2015

campaign - the man who ran the 2005 campaign which Maude then went on

subsequently, as party chairman, to roundly criticise.



But Maude, in an interview with the Guardian, rejects any suggestion that the

modernisers have been routed. Crosby had been hired "very late in the day" in

2005, and so had to fight a particular campaign, Maude says, adding, "he is a

brilliant campaigner. He brings discipline, focus and clarity."



He also insists the basic tenets of modernisation are alive. "Any party that

ceases to modernise is a party that is going backwards. The Conservative party

has been around for longer than any other party, and it has been more successful

over the centuries than any other party and it's done that because it has made

itself relevant to Britain as it is. We fail when we become backward looking,

and don't seem to be in tune with particularly how younger people see their

lives and see the country they want to live in. So if we cease to be a party in

tune with contemporary Britain, that's a problem. That's why modernisation is

not something about realigning the Conservative party's principles, it is simply

about making it current and making it contemporary."



He adds: "It has never been about ideology", or shifting to the left. He points

out that ever since his days as junior Thatcherite minister he has been a fiscal

Conservative, a realistic eurosceptic and in favour of open markets. "The

direction in which I guess I have moved is that I am definitely more socially

liberal today, but that is the direction in which the country has moved. If the

Conservative party were to lag behind the movement in social attitudes then that

is a problem for us, but I am happy to say I don't think we have."



So, in that context, is a marriage tax allowance a step back? Maude denies the

plan is illiberal, or that, through the tax system, the party judges one form of

relationship as superior to another.



He points out that when Cameron first made the pledge to reward marriage at the

2006 Tory conference, he won applause for saying "it would apply to a marriage

between a man and a woman, a man and a man, and a woman and a woman . . .

marriage is one of the institutions that creates glue in society and it makes

sense to recognise that".



The value of the marriage tax allowance, he argued, was not about signifying

relationships outside marriage were inferior, but simply in its practical impact

on social bonds.



Yet it has been just these cultural issues that have recently caused the party

so much grief, notably legalising gay marriage. Maude was one of the clearest

Tory advocates of the reform. Opponents claim the change has probably the single

biggest reason for an exodus of Tory members to Ukip.



Yet Maude is unrepentant, describing Ukip as out of touch with modern Britain.

The best response to the Ukip threat, he argues, lies in talking about what the

Conservatives will do on immigration and an EU referendum.



"We need to spend our time telling people what we're about rather than what Ukip

are about. For those people who are understandably concerned about Europe, we

need to stress there is only one way to be sure of a referendum on Europe and

that is to have a Conservative-led government. If they are concerned about

immigration, immigration soared out of control under Labour and has been cut by

a third under the coalition."



He insists that when it comes to the general election, voters will focus on the

fact that if they vote Ukip, they will get Ed Miliband. He is equally dismissive

about the Liberal Democrats, saying their main selling point is their ability to

say "no".



But is he concerned that somehow the Labour leader, with his populist attack on

the energy companies, has skillfully grabbed the cost-of-living agenda. Gove, on

BBC Question Time on Thursday night, praised Miliband for raising the issue, and

- in a line apparently dictated by Downing Street - took a critical view of the

big six energy companies.



But Maude is scathing about Miliband's speech declaring his energy bill price

freeze plan. He says: "It could have been a speech written by Len McClusky (the

Unite general secretary) and I think the issue for Labour is whether Ed Miliband

is a strong enough leader to stand up to the unions? He's talked tough but

actually when it came to it, he didn't stick with it and this was a Len McClusky

speech".



The 20-month price freeze was "a policy not properly thought through . . . the

biggest rise in energy prices was on Ed Miliband's watch".



That does not mean he thinks the energy firms are above reproach, but says the

answer lies in greater competition.



The long-term key to Tory success, he argues, remains the same as in 2005 when

he presented his party with slides showing voters liked Tory policies when

tested blind, but once they were ascribed to the Tories, support fell away. "We

need to ensure that voters wish to ascribe authentic and good motives to the

Conservatives."

Comment: Save us from ourselves: Merkel's hat-trick puts her at the helm in

Europe - and able to positively influence the debate here



BYLINE: Martin Kettle



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 32



LENGTH: 757 words





Across Europe, political leaders watch Angela Merkel with awe and envy. And

rightly so. The German chancellor didn't just get re-elected on Sunday, a

difficult enough task for leaders in post-crash Europe. Merkel won her hat-trick

of victories in the most serene electoral performance of her career, pushing her

centre-right CDU party's vote up by nearly eight points, and coming within a

whisker of winning Germany's first overall majority since the days of Konrad

Adenauer, more than half a century ago.



The only cloud in Merkel's sky was the historic collapse of her junior coalition

partners, the liberal FDP, who failed to win any seats in the Bundestag for the

first time in 60 years. That leaves Merkel with the problem of trying to

persuade either the Social Democrats, or conceivably the Greens, to come into a

coalition which they may see as a fatal embrace. The nations of the eurozone's

southern periphery will be hoping that some such deal is struck, as we all

should, since a coalition with either of them holds out the hope of a relaxation

of Merkel's strict pre-election budgetary orthodoxy.



The Guardian dubbed Merkel the Special One yesterday. And as an election winner

that's exactly what she is. Consider these freshly minted popularity ratings. In

Britain, David Cameron has a favourable/unfavourable rating of 40%/52% - giving

him net unpopularity of minus 12. In Germany, by contrast, 70% think Merkel is

doing a good job, against 30% who think she is doing a bad one - a net

popularity of plus 40.



What is Merkel's secret? The start of the answer is obviously that she is the

leader of Europe's richest and most dynamic economy. Germany's economy is

growing again, unemployment is low, the budget is in balance, interest rates are

on the floor. Times are pretty good, and getting better for many Germans.

Compared with the economic carnage elsewhere in the eurozone, Germany remains an

oasis of relative calm and prosperity. Crisis, what crisis?



But Merkel's success cannot simply be explained by her good fortune in being the

leader of Germany. Even when faced with large German bailouts of the eurozone

and by sluggish growth, the centre-left failed to make its case, just as the

centre-right triumphed. The centre-left SPD remains stuck in its now much

diminished core constituency - echoes of Labour here in Britain. So do the

Greens and the Left party, both of whom slipped back.



Yet Merkel has also won because of her own deft skills. Her republican centrism

means that voters from other parties like her. Her willingness to adapt to

circumstances, most notably in her U-turn over nuclear power after the Fukushima

disaster, is the antithesis of conviction politics. Add to this her inclusive

image and her attractively unpretentious style, and you have a winning

combination for difficult times. Merkel's success in appealing across Germany's

fragmenting party divides is a lesson from which traditional tribal politicians

in Britain could learn too.



What will it mean for Europe? Merkel sometimes gives the impression that she

takes each decision as it comes. But Berlin knows that the eurozone and the EU

need serious attention before Germany's next election in 2017. So this victory

gives her an immense opportunity to write the script for Europe's future.



In an era of weak governments and unpopular leaders in Europe, she is uniquely

positioned now to shape the next decade and more. In that context, the

performance by the eurosceptic Alternative fur Deutschland, who finished just

short of the 5% Bundestag threshold, was another perfect result for Merkel. She

does not have to take account of them in order to govern, but she knows they are

out there, and will be wary. It would be in character for her to temper her

European strategy accordingly.



From Britain's point of view, her re-election could be fascinatingly

significant. With Merkel at the helm in Europe, moderate Tory eurosceptics like

David Cameron have someone with whom they can deal and who also carries real

authority here. For Cameron, an EU deal with Merkel would make an EU referendum

victory, assuming he wants it, far more likely. If Merkel wants to - and if she

means it when she says she wants the UK to remain in the EU she should want to -

she is now in a position to influence the British debate on Europe in a more

positive way than any continental European since Jacques Delors. On the great

issue of Europe, the re-elected and strengthened Merkel may even help save the

British from themselves. Let's hope she does.

Labour conference, Brighton 2013: 'Unravelling' UK apprenticeship plan scorned

by business chiefs: Scheme for local workers must be offered EU-wide: CBI

condemns party's new 'tax on employment'



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour, Nicholas Watt and Rowena Mason



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 851 words





Labour plans to require firms hiring skilled foreign labour to also provide

local apprenticeships were challenged last night when business rejected the

idea, and the party conceded that the apprenticeships would have to be offered

to all EU workers.



In one of its big policy announcements of the conference, Labour said large

firms would have to train an apprentice if they wished to hire a skilled worker

from outside the EU. But the British Chambers of Commerce and CBI condemned the

proposals as adding more red tape. Some Labour frontbench members were shocked

that greater effort had not been made to convince business leaders in advance.



Some Labour figures involved in framing the apprenticeship policy did not appear

to have been consulted.



The advance publicity suggested "a Brit job for each foreign worker hired".

Miliband was himself quoted as saying: "Any firm that wants to bring in a

foreign worker from outside the EU will also have to train up someone who is a

local worker." But Labour internal briefings had made clear that the

apprenticeships would have to be available to anyone in the EU.



The policy has been in preparation for months and the party said it would be

included in a Labour government's immigration bill in the first term of

parliament.



However Alan Milburn, a former cabinet minister, said he was "worried" about

Labour's stance on immigration. He said he fears the party is "conniving" with

the Tories and Liberal Democrats to limit the number of foreigners coming into

the country. Britain needs more, not less, immigration to deal with the demands

of an ageing society, he said.



The Tory business minister Matthew Hancock said the scheme was unravelling and

illegal. To meet European rules on free movement of labour, the Tories said,

Miliband's policy would have to require companies to take on an EU national

apprentice, rather than a UK national, for every non-EU worker hired.



But Labour's immigration spokesman, Chris Bryant, said Hancock was wrong to

suggest the apprenticeship policy would be unlawful. The posts would be

available to anyone from the European Economic Area (EEA) - the EU, Iceland,

Liechtenstein and Norway - but in practice were likely to go to UK applicants.

Labour said the number of Germans or Bulgarians who would take up the offer of a

UK apprenticeship was minimal.



John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, condemned

the scheme as an "apprentice tax" on employers and on job creation. "It serves

neither to control immigration, where we should have a points system linked more

strongly to economic benefit, nor young people, who should be encouraged and

properly supported rather than being used to control immigration by other means.



"Businesses need to be able to choose the talents and resource they need, and

sometimes cannot find in the UK. This immigration benefits Britain. Penalising

good companies by making the grant of a work permit conditional on taking on a

UK apprentice just raises business costs and new red tape. There are far better

ways to support employers to take on and train our young people."



Miliband has highlighted a series of policies designed to provide greater

security for workers, including action on zero-hours contracts, and an increase

in the maximum fine from £5,000 to £50,000 for paying below the minimum wage, as

well as new powers for councils to enforce the minimum wage. No company was

prosecuted for underpaying between 1998 and 2007, and the shadow home secretary

said there had to be more prosecutions.



Labour has also set up a review to look into how the minimum wage can regain its

lost value, but put no figure on the necessary rise, or any timetable. Similar

proposals were announced by Vince Cable, the business secretary, last week.



In his interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme Miliband ruled out an early

commitment to hold a referendum on British membership of the EU, but left open

the possibility of changing his stance before the election. "We set out a very,

very clear position on this but we will set out our position at the election,"

he said.



Last night, the shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, acknowledged there

were splits in the shadow cabinet over a referendum, but that it was more an

issue of "refreshing consent rather than securing exit". He told a fringe

meeting: "I am not for a moment pretending there are not some who have suggested

we should countenance a referendum. But I would argue that those people within

Labour who argue for a referendum overwhelmingly see it as a means of refreshing

consent rather than securing exit."



Miliband told Marr that Labour would not build any more free schools and prevent

existing ones from expanding. But he said he would not close "good schools".



Miliband will also announce fresh plans to clamp down on profiteering energy

companies and a major housebuilding programme.

Rain on Merkel's parade - SPD scents return to coalition rule: Cameron be

warned: Social Democrat duo vying for power could skew EU plans



BYLINE: Philip Oltermann in Berlin



SECTION: GUARDIAN INTERNATIONAL PAGES; Pg. 36



LENGTH: 799 words





Angela Merkel may be the only German politician with true global recognition,

but Sunday's vote appears set to project into the limelight a less familiar

political duo, whose views and temperaments would shake up Europe and wrongfoot

David Cameron.



Once the votes from the election are counted on Sunday night, Merkel may well

find herself relying on the centre-left SPD for a governing majority. And the

unwritten rules of German coalitions mean that junior coalition partner bigwigs

get heavyweight roles - either foreign minister or finance minister.



Step forward Sigmar Gabriel and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, two SPD stalwarts with

pro-European credentials who could jeopardise Cameron's strategy of

renegotiating Britain's relationship with the EU ahead of a referendum. One

party insider insists that the Social Democrats would "actively try to block

attempts to return EU powers to national governments", as Cameron has proposed.

A source at the foreign ministry said: "Any attempt to cherry-pick EU policies

to keep or discard would cause friction with the traditional SPD line."



While Merkel has surprised many with her tolerance towards Cameron's "review of

competences" between EU and UK, a German government with Social Democrat

involvement is likely to take a dim view of "Europe a la carte", especially in

regard to social regulations such as the working time directive.



Steinmeier in particular is said to be a committed European with close links to

the French Socialists. The Social Democrats' failed candidate in the 2009

election, and foreign minister during the last grand coalition, he will remember

German frustration with British intransigence on Europe during the government of

Gerhard Schroder, for whom he was chief of staff.



Pressed on the subject, one of his advisers insists that he "has great interest

in keeping Britain in the EU", but it is worth remembering comments he made as

recently as December 2011: "I fear the decisive step for Great Britain's exit

has already been made . . . a process of alienation will become inevitable and

irreversible."



Temperamentally, Steinmeier could hardly be further apart from Gabriel, his main

opponent in a post-election race for the ministerial rank. Steinmeier has a

reputation as a bureaucrat who rarely loses his temper but also struggles to

raise the spirit of the party faithful. During his first stint as foreign

minister, he clashed with Merkel over the arrangements for Barack Obama's first

Berlin visit, but broadly he is seen as sharing her "consensual" approach.



Gabriel, on the other had, is what Germans call a Bauchmensch, someone who acts

on gut instinct. Aged 56 and a former teacher who was once nicknamed "Siggi Pop"

in his party, he is a impassioned orator and seasoned campaigner, who worked his

way through the SPD's party ranks and was responsible for the leftward lurch in

his party's current manifesto. He has openly called for the party to distance

itself from its "neoliberal phase" under Schroder. "Instead of changing the

political centre, the centre changed us," he said at the recent party

conference.



It is no surprise that the two men are said to share a mutual loathing of one

another. "I haven't joined his fan club yet," Steinmeier said after Gabriel

suggested the reintroduction of a wealth tax in 2009, and they are said to have

clashed after Gabriel tried to convince colleagues to vote against Merkel's

fiscal pact.



Yet it is Gabriel who currently has edged ahead of his rival in most

commentators' assessments. Christoph Schwennicke, editor of political monthly

Cicero and an SPD expert, believes Gabriel can lay claim to the vice chancellory

unless his party gets below 24%. Since the two parties would take turns in

picking their ministerial posts, Steinmeier would only be left with a minor role

and may decide to stay out of politics altogether.



Either way, observers in No 10 are advised to keep their eye on the SPD. The

last time the Social Democrats entered a grand coalition, they emerged with

their worst electoral result since the foundation of the federal republic,

mainly because the party was seen as getting on with Merkel all too well. In

order to avoid a rerun, many want a less cosy kind of coalition arrangement, and

will welcome the first good scrap with Merkel's CDU. A showdown with Britain may

just be what they are looking for.

Comment: Being stupid makes sense: If Labour is serious about winning the 2015

election Miliband must rule out a Europe referendum now



BYLINE: Julian Priestley



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 36



LENGTH: 630 words





Once, with his customary elevation of tone, Ed Balls called the idea of Labour

ruling out an in/out referendum on the EU "stupid". So let me be stupid just for

a moment: Ed Miliband should rule out a referendum now.



Earlier this year Miliband and his colleagues were absolutely right to criticise

the prime minister for his irresponsibility in calling a referendum five years

hence in circumstances unknown and after an at best uncertain negotiation for a

new settlement with the EU. They pointed out the potentially disastrous

consequences for market confidence and inward investment decisions. It would

also be a distraction for the whole EU at a time when it should be concentrating

on getting Europe back to work.



The British people seem not to have fallen for David Cameron's cynical manoeuvre

to shore up his position. If opportunism by a truly Eurosceptic party is not

rewarded by electors, imagine the punishment that would be meted out to a

genuinely pro-European party that lost its nerve on the EU after, perhaps, a

surge in the polls for Ukip at the next European elections; or in the feverish

pre-election atmosphere; or, say, at a party conference in some cack-handed

attempt to regain the initiative. A dose of opportunism may sometimes be

necessary in politics; but make it too blatant and it quite simply backfires.



Suppose we commit to holding an in/out referendum after the next election. Will

the next Labour government have such a rosy inheritance as to afford a luxury

that would not just be a distraction, but would derail our attempts to build

business confidence and attract investment and jobs to the UK?



The Labour approach - working with socialist and progressive allies in other

member states, attacking the austerity orthodoxy and committing the EU to a

growth agenda and strong social policies - would be undermined if we were

planning at the same time, for our own short-termist mediocre reasons, a

referendum that could foreshadow our exit.



So the only possible argument left for those in Labour who say we should opt for

an in/out referendum is the supposed democratic one. "The people" want their say

and that trumps all considerations. But the people's clamour is muffled: Europe

remains low down the list of public concerns.



Supporting the idea that our destiny is bound up with being a central player in

Europe is never going to be a great vote-winner. But Labour would gain respect

for being clear; for the contrast with the irresponsibility of the Tories; for

highlighting the anti-welfare-state agenda of which this is part; and perhaps

for showing a bit of statesmanship in the national interest. We would also find

support among business people. And after all, ultranationalists and Europhobes

will not be voting Labour.



Our chance of winning the election will be determined by the seriousness of our

economic programme, on which the shadow chancellor is doubtless devoting his not

inconsiderable talents. A referendum commitment would undermine its credibility.

Putting a clear and irrevocable stop now to months of media speculation on

whether Labour will triangulate our European future would help to focus our

attack on the miserable coalition record and our alternative.



And speaking of democracy, were Miliband and the shadow cabinet to go for a

referendum, notwithstanding their own previous crystal-clear condemnation of the

Tories' proposal, they would be reversing a central feature of party policy. It

is to be hoped that this could only be contemplated after thorough debate within

the party at all levels, followed by a democratic decision of party members -

not a diktat from on high.

Analysis: Anti-euro party could leave election outcome up in the air: Josie Le

Blond in Boblingen finds a surprising amount of support for the AfB's call to

consider leaving the single currency

In devotedly pro-European Germany, it is a radical message. In a packed beer

hall meeting on the outskirts of Stuttgart, Roland Klaus tells scores of

middle-aged, middle-class Germans what they want to hear. In short - no more

bailouts.



"We've got the possibility to stop this madness," the former financial TV

journalist intones. "Germany pays for no more rescue packages."



In an election in which the major parties essentially support Chancellor Angela

Merkel's approach to the euro crisis, and two-thirds of Germans back her euro

rescue plans, it is a surprise to find that thousands of Germans want to leave

the single currency.



The conventional argument is that Germany has come out of the euro crisis better

than its partners, and that Merkel has protected German national interests by

foisting austerity on the European south.



But not everyone sees it that way. And a new party, the Alternative fur

Deutschland (AfD), is seeking to tap into that resentment to get seats in

parliament in next Sunday's election.



The alternative to further bailouts, says the party, would be to refuse aid to

faltering economies, encouraging them to leave the eurozone under their own

steam. This would pave the way for a two-speed Europe with parallel currencies -

one for the struggling south and one for the productive north.



The plan appeals to voters like those in Baden-Wurttemberg, home to the

country's automobile industry and global headquarters of luxury carmakers

Daimler and Porsche. Many here say the euro was always doomed because of the

cultural gulf between the "lazy" south and the "industrious" north.



And if a smaller, streamlined eurozone failed to materialise, the party has

dared to suggest Germany would be better off out of it. "We'd say it clear. It

can't be a taboo any more that it's an option for Germany to return to the

Deutschmark," the AfD's Klaus tells his supporters to rapturous applause.



The AfD was formed in April by an economics professor, Bernd Lucke, who has

described the euro as a "great mistake and failure". It has remained a fringe

party - openly anti-euro sentiments have remained off-limits for all mainstream

parties. And despite everything, 66% of Germans support Merkel's policy of

rescuing the euro.



But this idealistic commitment to Europe, says the AfD, is blinding the country

to the long-term costs of repeatedly bailing out the eurozone. "We aren't left

or right," Klaus says. "We're citizens who are worried about the future of our

country."



For all Germany's pro-European rhetoric, there are signs these fears are not

uncommon. A poll in April suggested just under a third of Germans would in

principle vote for an anti-euro party - yet it is still unclear whether this

will translate into the minimum 5% of votes needed for the eurosceptics to enter

parliament in next weekend's election.



"The issue of Europe, let alone the common European currency, has never played a

role in a German election," says Peter Matuschek, political analyst at German

public opinion researchers Forsa. "As a purely anti-euro party, the AfD would

have no chance of getting enough votes to enter parliament."



Wary of being pigeonholed as a single-issue party, the AfD has promoted its

wider, populist policies. Calls for a tougher stance on unskilled immigrants and

stricter rules on benefits to stem economic migrants appeal to the rightwing

populist vote, as does the promotion of Swiss-style direct democracy based on

referendums.



In response, leftwing groups have accused the AfD of providing a political home

for neo-Nazis and racists, something vehemently denied by the leadership. Yet

over the summer regional chapters said they had seen attempts by Germany's

far-right fringe to infiltrate the party. Desperate to shake off this damaging

association, the AfD has distanced itself from other anti-EU parties across

Europe, emphasising it is not calling for Germany to exit the EU.



The party's fortunes were given a boost last month when the German finance

minister, Wolfgang Schauble, indicated that Greece would probably need yet

another bailout. Since then party officials say their support has swelled and

they are now expecting to hit at least 7% or 8% of the vote, despite struggling

to top 3% in the polls.



Analysts say the AfD's chances on 22 September will be at the mercy of

unpredictable protest voters. "At every election . . . there are protest voters

who, without ideological conviction, vote for any party they feel will most

clearly demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the status quo," says Klaus-Peter

Schoppner, head of opinion pollster Emnid.



If the AfD gets enough votes to enter the Bundestag it could deny a majority to

either the current coalition government or the opposition - potentially forcing

Merkel into a pact with rivals the Social Democratic party (SPD). Neither party

wants this, but polls suggest this would be a majority of voters' preferred

outcome.

Tories furious after EU chief accuses part of aping Ukip



BYLINE: Rowena Mason, Political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 9



LENGTH: 484 words





The president of the European Commission has sparked a row with the

Conservatives by accusing them of copying Ukip and suggesting Nigel Farage's

party will become Britain's "first force" in Brussels.



His remarks provoked outrage among Tories, who said last night they "disagree

strongly with the president of the commission". Downing Street also slapped down

Barroso's suggestion that anti-Europe feeling could take the continent back to

"divisions, the war, the trenches".



Barroso made the remarks to the Conservative leader in Brussels, Martin

Callanan, telling him: "Your party is looking like Ukip. I have some doubts

whether you are going to be elected in Britain or if it is not Ukip that will be

the first force in British elections. Because when it comes to being against

Europe, people prefer the original to the copy. That is probably why they are

going to vote for Mr Farage."



A source close to the prime minister said: "The President of the European

Commission should respect the views of the governing party elected by the people

of Britain.



"Of course it would be more convenient to the Brussels elite to have other

parties they think they can ignore. However, the prime minister will continue to

stand up for the British people, fighting to ensure they get the best deal in

Europe and have a say on it in a referendum by 2017."



A Conservative spokesman said support for Britain's EU membership was wafer-thin

and that the EU needs fundamental change. "Ukip are all talk when it comes to

the EU. Only Conservatives will deliver change and a referendum," he said.



Barroso's remarks will be a boost for Ukip ahead of next year's elections, but

last night the party was embroiled in a controversy over the suspension of Chris

Pain, a senior figure who has been tipped to become the party's first ever MP.



Pain became Ukip group leader on Lincolnshire county council in May, after the

party took 16 seats in the local elections. The sweeping electoral success of

Ukip in Lincolnshire made the Tory seat of Boston & Skegness one of the party's

best hopes of getting an MP at the next election.



However, Pain is now facing disciplinary proceedings under the party's

"emergency powers". Shortly after his election, comments were posted on a

Facebook page purportedly belonging to Pain referring to illegal immigrants as

"sandal-wearing, bomb-making, camel-riding, goat-******* ragheads". Pain has

denied making the comments, saying one of his accounts could have been hacked or

cloned.



Ukip has declined to reveal why Pain has been suspended, saying it would be

"wrong and unfair" before a committee has heard the evidence against Pain.



However, Pain said the suspension is to do with a "big issue" between him and

Steve Crowther, the party's chairman, and not the Facebook incident.

Barroso sparks dispute with Tories over Ukip: Cameron told British will

'probably vote for Farage': Remarks are boost for party amid row over Pain

The president of the European Commission has sparked a major row with the

Conservatives by accusing them of copying Ukip and suggesting Nigel Farage's

party will become Britain's "first force" in Brussels.



In an outburst to MEPs, Jose Manuel Barroso said British people are "probably

several fellow councillors. Shortly after his election, Pain became embroiled in

a row over a Facebook page, after comments were found referring to illegal

Europa: Analysis: Cameron's EU wishes dashed by reluctant Germany



BYLINE: Ian Traynor, Europe editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 22



LENGTH: 660 words





If there is one thing that is clear from a lacklustre German election campaign,

it is that the voters are not hungry for change. That's excellent news for the

incumbent chancellor, Angela Merkel, who looks like a shoo-in for a third term

on 22 September. The big question is, who becomes her junior coalition partner:

the current liberals, or Free Democrats (FDP), if they surmount the

5%-of-the-vote hurdle, or a grand coalition with the second-biggest party, the

Social Democrats (SPD)?



If the Germans are voting for no big change in Germany, they will also be voting

for no dramatic shift in Merkel's European policy. Unlikely to disappoint her

voters, she is certain to disappoint her fellow EU leaders.



"However the Germans vote, Berlin's attitude to the EU is not going to change

much," Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, wrote this

week. Most analysts agree.



Ulrike Guerot, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, in Berlin, said:

"The Germany that many in Europe hope for is not on offer. It is hard to imagine

any new government coalition - or the old one, if it is returned to power -

providing enlightened leadership of a kind that accepts significant short-term

sacrifice to buy into a far more uncertain vision of long-term political

stability. Germany lives in a different world."



EU business has been effectively on hold for months as the union awaits the

outcome of what is by far the biggest political event in Europe this year. The

ballot will be followed by weeks of horse trading and programme-writing as

Merkel weighs up her coalition options.



The pressures on Merkel are high. David Cameron is keen to forge a reformist

alliance that would allow him to "repatriate" powers to Britain from Brussels

before a 2017 referendum on EU membership.



Those hopes are almost certain to be dashed. Any new deal would entail

renegotiating the EU treaties. There is no appetite for that in Brussels or

Paris, and a diminishing one in Berlin. The odds are that Cameron will be

disappointed. He won't be the only one.



The big innovation currently being cooked up in eurozone capitals in response to

the euro crisis is the new system of banking supervision and regulation known as

the banking union. The idea is to make the European Central Bank in Frankfurt

the supervisory authority for the eurozone banking sector, initially the big

banks. That bit is effectively accomplished and comes into force towards the end

of next year.



Its corollary is the tricky part: a resolution authority and fund to deal with

weak or bad banks. That body would decide whether a bank gets wound up or helped

out. For the European commission, the French, the Italians and the Spanish, that

means common fiscal backstops in the eurozone and pooled eurozone funds for

dealing with a banking collapse.



The Germans are resisting, unwilling to have to pay for other countries' bank

failures or repairs and also reluctant to force German banks to contribute to a

resolution fund that could shore up, for example, a Spanish bank.



Enrico Letta, the Italian prime minister, pleaded in Brussels on Monday for

greater German flexibility. "Some degree of risk-sharing" was needed in the

eurozone, he argued.



Consistently, through more than three years of eurozone crisis, Merkel has been

pressed to do more, but her bottom line has always been to refuse German

liability for the faults of others unless German rules are observed.



France is impatient for the German election to be over. On certain issues the

two sides may be nearing common ground: they have both turned against Brussels

and the European commission, and increasingly see the eurozone, as opposed to

the wider EU, as the fulcrum of European integration. It is here that things may

change after the election, but more likely by stealth and small steps.



With EU leaders confident they have weathered the worst of the crisis, Merkel

can claim vindication, and will find little reason to change her approach.

Polish roots to plum cake: six surprising Merkel facts



BYLINE: Stefan Kornelius in Munich



SECTION: GUARDIAN INTERNATIONAL PAGES; Pg. 22



LENGTH: 619 words





If Angela Merkel is re-elected on 22 September, she will become Europe's longest

serving elected female head of government. Yet there is still plenty of mystery

about this woman who charted an unlikely course from research science in the

former communist East Germany to leader of Europe's most powerful nation.



1. Angela Kazmierczak?



Not only was her grandfather of Polish origin, the chancellor was almost born

Angela Kazmierczak. Her grandfather was Ludwig Kazmierczak, born 1896 in Poznan

- then part of the German reich. He emigrated to Berlin when Poznan became

Polish after the first world war, married a Berlin woman, and they had a son,

Horst, Angela's father. In the early 1930s the family Germanised their surname

to Kasner. Father and son converted from Catholicism to Protestantism -

something Merkel didn't know until recently - a puzzling discovery for a woman

who grew up in a rectory and whose faith is key to her personality.



2. Plum job



In her early public life, Merkel loved to brag about her cooking abilities,

especially her plum cake. The cake soon became a measure of how much time she

could afford her private life and husband. As a junior minister under Helmut

Kohl, she was still able to have two or three baking weekends each plum season.

The plum cake stories trickled away when she became chancellor.



3. Dog days



Merkel and Vladimir Putin go back further than you might think. He was a KGB

agent in East Germany when the wall fell. Merkel, the greatest benefactor of the

1989-revolution, got a taste of his intimidatory tactics very early. When she

first visited the Kremlin as chancellor, Putin gave her a plush toy dog as a

gift. Merkel has been deeply afraid of dogs since she was bitten in the

mid-1990s. The next meeting Putin let in his black Labrador Kony. Merkel sat

frozen, and pictures show Putin with a grin.



4. Inca hoots



Merkel sees similarities between the EU and the ancient Inca. Merkel fears the

European value system could also suddenly disappear without trace. Democracy,

liberal market economies, the western legal system are battling the modern

version of the cold war against authoritarian, non-democratic but economically

strong systems. Merkel has seen a state collapse in her lifetime. That's the

reason for her call to competitiveness and recovery in Europe - and she's afraid

Europe doesn't get it.



5. Easy Cameron, easy go



David Cameron sees himself as a close ally of Merkel. But the feeling might not

be reciprocated. She likes his policies, his global vision, his stands on

competitiveness and the Asian challenge and his debating skills. She is also

keen on changing the treaties, but only if there is a strong need. Losing the

entire EU system in one of the many referenda following a change would be too

dangerous. So Merkel is a fan of the newly discovered intergovernmentalism -

treaties between member states instead of ever more integration favouring the

commission. Cameron got a taste when he was asked to join the fiscal pact during

the euro crisis. He decided against. Britain is out. And Merkel couldn't care

less.



6. Euro plan



So, how does Merkel really want to get out of the euro mess? She has a plan,

written down in summer 2011 by an adviser. In it she accepts that key policies

within EU member states have to be controlled more closely and jointly to keep

the currency alive. Will that mean more Brussels? The opposite is true. Merkel

is aware of the public being tired of the commission and the lack of

accountability. So for the time being, she'd prefer national governments writing

the rules and sticking to them.

Leading article: David Cameron: Gambling on Germany



BYLINE: Editorial



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 24



LENGTH: 464 words





Next month's German general election will naturally have most impact in Germany

itself. But the rest of Europe's politicians are watching the German campaign

very closely too - and so should Europe's peoples. This is partly because a

prosperous and growing Germany is a more dominant player than ever in today's

EU. But it is also because the choice that Germans make on 22 September will

directly affect us all, whether we are members of the eurozone or not. The list

of interested parties therefore includes Britain.



David Cameron has three particular reasons for wanting Chancellor Angela

Merkel's centre-right CDU to be re-elected next month. The first is that, in

spite of real differences over what it means to be a centre-right party in

21st-century Europe, the CDU and the Conservatives remain sister parties. They

have become distanced, notably because of Tory Euroscepticism - not shared by

the CDU - and by Mr Cameron's withdrawal of the Tories from the European

People's party grouping. But the Tories clearly have even less in common with

the CDU's principal rivals, the Social Democratic party of Germany (SPD).



Mr Cameron's second reason is that it would be good news for incumbents like

him. For a while, after the 2008 financial crisis, European voters simply took

it out on incumbent governments - whatever their political stripe. Brown and

Zapatero on the left, Berlusconi and Sarkozy on the right - all lost out. If Mrs

Merkel manages to buck the trend, not least in the wake of her commitment to

economic austerity and deficit reduction, the Tories will see light at the end

of their own tunnel too.



But Mr Cameron's principal reason for wanting a CDU victory next month is that a

re-elected Mrs Merkel would be pivotal to his own EU strategy if he, too,

secures re-election in 2015. Last week, in an important interview, Mrs Merkel

signalled that, if re-elected, she is willing to look at EU moves to "give

something back" to member states. This is what Mr Cameron says he wants to do

too, so that he can offer British voters a renegotiated relationship with the EU

to approve in his 2017 referendum. If reports are to be believed, two areas on

which the UK and Germany might agree are migrant benefits and labour market

regulation.



The upshot of all this is deeply paradoxical. Tories like Mr Cameron, who want

to stay in the EU after renegotiations of the sort which the German leader seems

now to be sanctioning, will obviously want Mrs Merkel to be re-elected. But

there are few things the Tories' out-and-out anti-Europeans should fear more

than a German chancellor willing to make concessions to keep the UK in the EU.

For anti-EU Tories, nothing would be worse than Mrs Merkel's re-election and the

boost it might give to an eventual yes vote in a UK referendum.

Saturday: The Saturday interview: 'A huge injustice has been done': The scandal

that hit Labour in Falkirk last month hurt the party badly and led to Tom

Watson's resignation as election co-ordinator. But in his first major interview,

he is adamant that there was no wrongdoing - and that Labour has bigger issues

to address



BYLINE: Decca Aitkenhead



SECTION: GUARDIAN SATURDAY COMMENT PAGES; Pg. 33



LENGTH: 1921 words





'I'm not very good at these things," Tom Watson volunteers as soon as we meet.

"I've never done an interview like this before." It's a funny thing for Labour's

former election co-ordinator to say, when he's been in politics for 30 years,

and has a reputation as a veteran operator. But he does seem genuinely

apprehensive. Watson had said nothing about his resignation from the shadow

cabinet six weeks ago, but then he went on holiday, thought about it some more,

and decided he actually has quite a lot to say. If he seems apprehensive, that's

probably because most of it contradicts his own party's official line.



Watson resigned after allegations that Unite had been signing up its members to

join the Falkirk Labour party without their knowledge or permission, in a bid to

secure support for the nomination of the union's candidate, Karie Murphy - who

just happens to be Watson's office manager. Unite's general secretary, Len

McCluskey, also happens to be Watson's great ally and former flatmate, as well

as Murphy's close friend. Labour suspended Murphy, called in the police, and

proposed a drastic reform of the party's financial link to the unions. Watson

thinks on all three counts his party got it wrong.



"I thought it was silly to report the allegations to the police, bordering on

wasting police time." The whole affair, he insists, is "a storm in a teacup",

since neither Murphy nor Unite did anything wrong. No one in Falkirk was signed

up to Labour without their consent.



Is he saying the entire scandal never happened? "I am. I don't believe it. The

reports in the press are wrong. Karie has told me she doesn't believe that

anyone working on her campaign within Unite signed up people without their

knowledge, and I believe her. I think a huge injustice has been done to her.

When they complete this inquiry they will find she hasn't done anything wrong."



How can he be so sure? Labour refused to show Watson its own internal report

into the allegations before handing it to the police, but he is adamant that no

one in Unite broke any rules. So how can he explain why a Unite member in

Falkirk wrote to Labour to complain about being signed up the party without his

permission? "I've read unattributed briefings in the press. I've not seen any

spokesperson on the record naming the people who said it happened to them." But

one paper published a direct quote from the letter, so I read it aloud: "Myself

and two family members have been enrolled by Unite. I or my family did not fill

in or sign any form."



Watson's version of events is very different. He says he has established that it

was a rival candidate who made the initial complaint to Labour that Murphy's

team were recruiting members without their consent. When the party asked for

proof, it received two letters from newly joined-up Labour members in Falkirk.

He insists neither of the senders were members of Unite, nor had they been

recruited on the trade union membership scheme, under which the union pays the

party membership fees. Both letters were in the same handwriting, and in block

capitals, Watson says. He claims both senders later withdrew the letters and

signed affidavits to say they'd willingly joined the party, their letters had

been drafted by a third party, and the content was inaccurate. According to

Watson, the only text of a complaint that appeared in Labour's final report was

the content of an email from the rival candidate who first made the allegation

against Murphy's Unite team.



The Labour National Executive Committee (NEC) members who suspended Murphy and

Stephen Deans, the local party chairman, were not even shown original copies of

the withdrawn letters. Nor, as far as Watson knows, were party officials made

aware of the statements made by the senders. "Even now," Watson adds angrily,

"Karie and Stephen Deans have not been formally asked for their version of

events. They've been suspended from the party, face a disciplinary that could

include expulsion, their conduct reported to the police. They are the subject of

press briefings from party 'insiders' and 'spokespeople' - and have never been

given the right to account for their actions."



Yesterday a Labour spokesman reiterated the party's position. "Tom is wrong.

Throughout this process Ed Miliband acted swiftly and thoroughly to uphold the

integrity of the party and would take the same action again. No evidence has

been withdrawn and reporting the matter to the police was done on legal advice.

This country has a choice between old, machine politics and clean, transparent

politics. Ed Miliband has always and will always choose openness, integrity and

transparency." Sources said the two letters are a "red herring" and the party

investigation into Murphy and Deans is ongoing.



If Watson is right, there is no case to answer. But for some within Labour, he

argues, this little local row presented the golden opportunity they'd been

waiting for. "I don't think there's anything revelatory about the fact that

there's a group of people who would rather there not be a union link within the

party, and they seized on this. Peter (Mandelson) jumped in straight away." It

was equally irresistible to David Cameron, "who seized on it and made it an

issue of Ed's leadership", and the twin pressures quickly led to demands for a

debate about the future of Labour's links with the unions. "And the Buddha-like

Ed, I can see him sitting there thinking, OK, if this is going to be it, then

let's just do it."



With all parties more invested in forcing the debate than finding out the truth

in Falkirk, Watson claims they were only too willing to believe Unite's leaked

boasts of having influenced Labour nominations across the country - when in fact

they are wild exaggerations. "I read them and thought, well, this is just

preposterous. Unions have less influence over selection than they have had in

100 years; they're hopeless at organising their candidates. The idea that

they're taking over the Labour party is just not true. It's just not factually

correct."



Watson sounds as if he might wish it were, though, when I ask if he shares

McCluskey's view that Unite gives much more to Labour than it gets back, and

can't be expected to keep filling the party's coffers without more of a say over

its policies. "I do," he agrees. "There is not a great deal of logic to unions

giving this huge amount of money to Labour if they feel they're not even

participating in the party they founded." Closer ties would benefit Labour, too,

he argues, by providing access to the union's vast membership, which could be

galvanised into greater grassroots participation.



"So it's right that we have this debate. I just think it's got a ridiculously

narrow focus in the way it's been engineered." The obsession with whether union

members opt in or out of a financial levy for Labour is "almost irrelevant", he

shrugs. "They can sort it out, I don't really care what solution they come up

with. For me it's just dancing on the head of a pin." For Watson the real

problem is endemic disengagement from party politics. "The truth is, our

parliamentary democracy is broken," he says, and he wants Labour to embark upon

a much more radical debate about how, far from being the problem, trade unions

could actually be the answer.



"Len McCluskey's got an argument when he says, 'Hold on a minute, the combined

membership of all the political parties in parliament is still fewer than the

people who pay £120 a year to join Unite - don't talk to us about relevance.'

All three major parties are becoming increasingly irrelevant to more and more

people, and at some point we'll have to have an honest conversation about it. If

you look beyond Falkirk, there's a crisis in politics, isn't there? A crisis of

relevance, of political parties themselves. The formula that got New Labour

elected was successful for its times, but we were left stranded in an arid

desert of pragmatism, and we need a route map out of that."



If MPs are to reconnect with voters, Watson sees two options: change the

electoral system to give smaller parties a parliamentary voice, or change their

own ways to accommodate a broader range of personalities and opinions. Trade

unions could be the "transmission belt" between the public and parliamentary

politics, and help ordinary working people from all sorts of backgrounds get

selected to stand as MPs. He wishes general secretaries would stop pretending

they want to give "a voice for ordinary people", when what they really mean, he

says, is a voice for left-wingers on Labour's benches.



Whatever debate Labour ends up having about the unions, Watson won't now be at

the heart of it, but he never blames Miliband, or criticises his leadership.

"He's got the calmness of Atlee and the analysis of Tony (Blair). There might be

reasons why Labour's not getting its message across, but it's not Ed," he says.

How come he's still polling so badly then? Watson concedes that "Ed's got to get

his message across with greater clarity, and got to show more of himself,

particularly of his leadership qualities. But I'll think he'll do that."



Watson's real problem appears to have been his frustration with the shadow

cabinet. He fears they have struggled to grasp that being in opposition means

they cannot set the agenda. His colleagues aren't wrong to argue that this is

not the right time for an EU referendum - "but we're not in control of that

debate. Cameron has set the agenda on Europe; he wants a referendum, and if we

don't engage with that debate then it won't be on our terms. So I would argue

for a referendum next May - get it out the way before the election. That should

be Labour's position. Yes to a referendum, and yes to remaining part of Europe."

Yet the subject was seldom discussed in cabinet. Did he think that was a tad

negligent? "Yes, I did."



The other argument he's been longing to make would require owning up to the last

Labour government's own mistakes. "There was huge market failure in the finance

and banking sector - everyone knows that - and we've not robustly said so. The

truth is that in government we didn't sufficiently map out the contours of the

mixed economy and put stakes in the ground about where the market can't go. We

were frightened of dealing with some of those so-called great Thatcherite

legacies, like liberalisation of the City, so we let the City grow out of

control. Why don't we just say that?" Might it be to do with protecting Ed

Balls' reputation? "I don't know," he says, but doesn't sound entirely

convincing. "I didn't do the economy, I was the coordinator."



Once Labour has admitted the reason for the 2008 crash, it could then offer a

"distinctive economic programme" of investment to create jobs. "It's all about

jobs. Not taking risks is not an option." Does Labour's current economic policy

takes too few risks? "Yes, definitely. The country is in a crisis. If Labour's

not going to give the bold solution, then who is?" Is he saying - and I use

McCluskey's own words - the party mustn't be a "pinkish shadow of the

coalition"? "Yes, of course I'm saying that."



I ask Watson if it's ever occurred to him that his views seem to have much more

in common with McCluskey's than with anything coming out of his own party's

front bench. He chuckles.



"I've never thought of it in those terms before. But then again, I haven't

answered questions like this 'til now."

Comment: Labour has faced its demons, Tories are still ruled by theirs: Miliband

spent the past year laying building blocks for his policies, while the

Conservatives wallowed in their old nastiness



BYLINE: Polly Toynbee



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 33



LENGTH: 1084 words





Politics abhors a vacuum, so summer madness frenetically fills the void. While

Ed Miliband was in France with no phone, David Cameron visited dogs homes and

bombarded the airwaves of radio stations like a nuisance caller. Crisis for

Labour!



In mood-swinging Westminster the Tories were at rock bottom only months ago, and

there's no need for Labour wobblers to panic now. Yesterday Labour's YouGov lead

was 6%, on a par with its recent average. Labour can win on just 35%, while

unfairly Cameron needs 40% for a majority. Labour's recent slippage was

predictable, as the economy was bound to start growing. Of course, the Tories

always expected to fight in 2015 on a claim they had "fixed Labour's mess, don't

let them ruin it". Labour falling to 16% behind on economic trust has frayed

nerves: but Tony Blair won in 1997 lagging 22% behind on the economy. The

long-sighted in Labour ranks genuinely welcome a recovery: if Labour is going to

win, then better by far to inherit growth, as governing well after 2015 will be

hard enough.



Miliband returns to an overflowing suggestions box: some well-intentioned, some

hostile, all of it contradictory. Go left, go right, bring back grey beards,

bring on clean hands and fresh faces. In a reshuffle before the party conference

to replace Tom Watson, no doubt some ineffective silent ones will go - education

and local government show a notable absence of policy, while many round the

leader were perplexed at the shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne,

writing a book about China while his opposite number, Iain Duncan Smith, damages

claimants and tortures statistics. However, managing human resources on the

frontbench is the least of Miliband's problems.



The great dilemma is always the same. How far can you go? I have a pretty good

notion of what Miliband would like to do, if freed of the need to win all kinds

of voters. My guess is his gut views are closely allied to most in his party:

tax the rich, abolish the bedroom tax, build a million homes, use every lever to

spread a living wage, try to cap high pay, stop the house price boom, don't

privatise Royal Mail, do let rail franchises fall back to public ownership, only

use private provision where the public sector palpably needs it, clean up party

funding, impose a fair admissions code on schools, abandon Trident but keep a

token nuclear weapon, reform the Lords, bring in proportional representation,

and refuse an EU referendum because Labour will not lead Britain to doom outside

Europe. Some of these he will indeed promise, all would warm the cockles of his

core vote.



The fear is how a Labour wish list translates into Lynton Crosby-speak: "The

welfare party that bankrupted Britain will leave the country defenceless while

rewarding scroungers and chasing away wealth-creators, handing public services

to their unions, stopping school choice and refusing to let you decide on

Europe." If only there were a simple left and right divide, but many of Labour's

erstwhile and potential voters - the same people suffering their worst fall in

living standards, the same who think Tory toffs couldn't care less - also think

Labour lets welfare and immigration rip.



How easy for outsiders, disaffected backbenchers or us commentators to prescribe

how Labour can win. No one knows. This isn't about "lacking the cojones" as the

admirable campaigner Ellie Mae O'Hagan wrote on our website yesterday; it's

about how best to stop a Tory victory next time, and that may take cojones of

another kind. We can urge no trimming, forget focus groups, bravery is the best

policy with convictions to restore faith in politics. I might recommend that

Miliband lies the way Cameron lied - barefacedly promising one thing and doing

the opposite. You should see Miliband blench at the idea: it's not for him. Nor

does he think it would be credible to pretend to Tory values while secretly

planning socialism. But no one knows the winning formula.



Labour has plentiful reasons not to be glum. The Tories count on growth to see

them through - but when YouGov asks if growth benefits those on middle and lower

incomes, 70% say no, only 10% say yes. Even Tory voters say no. The "cost of

living crisis" will be just as real in 2015, with wages still falling below

inflation, so the election will be fought on Labour turf - whose growth is it

anyway?



Doubters ask if Ed's got what it takes, but what exactly is that magic "it"? If

Ted Heath or John Major had "it", that's a most mysterious quality. Jim

Callaghan personally outpolled Margaret Thatcher by miles - but lost. Major had

zinging economic growth and lost. There are few rules, leaders make their own

history. The most alarming response to Miliband's egging this week was the

people who asked, "But why?" - utterly bewildered that anyone should have a

strong feeling about him one way or the other. If he needs friends, he needs

enemies too, as he needs definition.



Allies know him as clever, decent and determined, but the public hardly knows

him yet. His messages vanish into air when he makes a key speech as if it were a

dissertation to be marked, with no team follow-up. But he has two rare assets -

he has no challenger, or any serious party eating his votes from the left, as

the Lib Dems once did.



With a Zen calmness, Miliband claims a clear strategy that people will soon spy.

He has spent the last year laying building blocks to bear the weight of visions

and policies soon to come. Whether you think them pragmatic necessities or

Tory-lite sell-outs, he has made tough choices on accepting a first-year

spending straitjacket, a public pay freeze, a cap (sort of) on benefit spending,

while Ed Balls stops anyone promising anything. Labour has been facing its

demons, and foundations are laid.



Compare that, say Labour people, with the profligate Tories, who have done no

spadework on their negatives. Instead of re-detoxifying and digging their way

back to the centre ground, they have cavorted in their far comfort zone,

wallowing in the old nastiness of public sector cuts, immigration and

scroungers. Warding off Ukip in their marginals has pushed them too far off the

sacred pitch where elections are won, while polls show how strongly the public

regard them as toffs ruling for their own kind.



But the economic news has Tory tails up, and in-fighting is down. Labour needs

an autumn bounce, the start of a warm engagement with voters' hearts and minds

that has been lacking until now. And it needs to keep its nerve.

Comment: Gibraltar and the Falklands deny the logic of history: These relics of

empire pay hardly any UK tax - but when the neighbours cut up nasty, they demand

the British protect them



BYLINE: Simon Jenkins



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 27



LENGTH: 1078 words





Nothing beats a gunboat. HMS Illustrious glided out of Portsmouth on Monday,

past HMS Victory and cheering crowds of patriots. Within a week it will be off

Gibraltar, a mere cannon shot from Cape Trafalgar. The nation's breast heaves,

the tears prick. The Olympic spirit is off to singe the king of Spain's beard.

How dare they keep honest British citizens waiting six hours at Spanish border

control? Have they forgotten the Armada?



The British empire had much to be said for it, but it is over - dead, deceased,

struck off, no more. The idea of a British warship supposedly menacing Spain is

ludicrous. Is it meant to bomb Cadiz? Will its guns lift a rush-hour tailback in

a colony that most Britons regard as awash with tax dodgers, drug dealers and

right-wing whingers? The Gibraltarians have rights, but why British taxpayers

should send warships to enforce them, even if just "on exercise", is a mystery.



Any study of Britain's currently contentious colonies, Gibraltar and the

Falklands, can reach only two conclusions. One is that Britain's claim to them

in international law is wholly sound, the other is that it is nowadays wholly

daft.



Twenty-first century nation states will no longer tolerate even the mild

humiliation of hosting the detritus of 18th- and 19th-century empires. Most

European empires were born of the realpolitik of power. The same realpolitik now

ordains their dismantling.



Of course those living in these colonies have a right to be considered, but such

rights have never overridden political reality. Nor has Britain claimed so. The

residents of Hong Kong and Diego Garcia were not consulted, let alone granted

"self-determination", when Britain wanted to dump them. Hong Kong was handed to

China in 1997 when the New Territories lease ended. Diego Garcia was demanded by

and handed to the Pentagon in 1973. The Hong Kong British were denied passports,

and the Diego Garcians were summarily evicted to Mauritius and the Seychelles.



Britain's security does not depend on coaling stations in the Atlantic. France

survives without any longer owning Senegal and Pondicherry, and Portugal without

Sao Tome and Goa. When the Indians seized Goa in 1961, the world did not object.

Indeed the Argentinian invasion plan for the Falklands in 1982 was called

Operation Goa, as Buenos Aires assumed it would likewise be seen as a

post-imperial clear-up.



Relics of the British empire now mostly survive in the interstices of the global

economy. They are the major winners from the fiscal haemorrhage that has

resulted from financial globalisation. Many have become synonymous with sleaze.

American tax authorities wax furious over Bermuda. George Osborne is out to get

the tax dodgers of the Caymans and British Virgin Islands.



Spain has long held grievances over Gibraltar's role in aiding people smuggling,

money laundering and offshore gambling beyond its own regulatory reach. This

culminated in a 2007 IMF report on shortcomings in the colony's financial

regulation. Though this is being implemented, the US department of state could,

in March, still call the Rock "a major European centre of money laundering".

Gibraltar's status as a tax haven has brought it surging wealth, fuelling

Spain's rage at so much money pouring untaxed through what it regards as its own

territory.



Such colonies claim to be "more British than the British", except that they pay

no UK tax and act as tax havens for funds from Britain. Colonies claim

allegiance to the crown, but not to its exchequer, or its financial police. They

are Churchillian theme parks of red pillar boxes, fish and chips and warm beer.

But they want the smooth without the rough. When the neighbours cut up nasty,

they demand that those whose taxes protect them should send soldiers, diplomats

and lawyers to their aid.



The legal argument between Britain and Spain is in Britain's favour. Though

Britain failed to join the Schengen area with free border crossings, all EU

states supposedly ease the movement of their citizens. Spain's proposed £43

admission charge is excessive. It might seem ironic for Tory ministers to plead

their cause before the hated European courts, but that is the right place to go.

Law-law is better than play-acting at war-war.



That said, it is beyond belief that an honest broker could not resolve this

centuries-old dispute. Britain has, on several occasions, sought a compromise

deal on Gibraltar's sovereignty. Thatcher initiated talks in 1984, after

successfully settling Rhodesia and Hong Kong. The Spaniards offered Gibraltar

devolved status, like the Basques and Catalans, respecting language, culture and

a degree of fiscal autonomy. As Hong Kong has shown, sovereignty transfer does

not mean political absorption.



The curse has been Spanish ineptitude feeding Gibraltarian intransigence. Border

hold-ups are counterproductive to winning hearts and minds, as were blundering

Argentinian landings on the outer Falklands. This pushed British governments to

the wall and made them vulnerable to colonial lobbyists wielding the demand for

self-determination. A 2002 Gibraltar referendum gave 98% support for continued

colonial status - a Falklands vote gave a similar result. It's a far cry from

Thatcher's readiness to surrender Hong Kong and accept "sovereignty with

leaseback" from both Madrid and Buenos Aires.



The truth is that Britain's tax-haven colonies feel more secure than ever,

blessed by British protection and free to skim the dark side of the global

economy for cash. This has bred a tribe of gilded "Britons" who live in a

perpetual other-world. When I asked a Gibraltarian who claimed to be "150%

British" why he should not at least pay 100% British taxes, he replied: "Why

should I pay for people thousands of miles away?"



While they deny the logic of history and geography, neither Gibraltar nor the

Falklands will ever be truly "safe". One day these hangovers will somehow merge

into their hinterlands and cease to be grit in the shoe of international

relations. This day will be hastened if world governments take action to end tax

havens.



Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Gibraltar can go on voting "to stay British" as

long as they like. But if they do not accept the disciplines most Europeans

accept, while sucking business from Europe's financial centres, they can hardly

expect one EU state to protect them from another. An occasional six-hour queue

at La Linea is a small price to pay for declining to join the real world.

Palestinians and Israelis clash over resumption of peace talks: Key Israeli

leaders dismiss embryonic negotiations Palestinians dig in over US guarantee on

1967 borders



BYLINE: Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem



SECTION: GUARDIAN INTERNATIONAL PAGES; Pg. 13



LENGTH: 746 words





Moves towards a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks were mired in

rumours, rebuttals, criticism and confusion yesterday in an indication of the

political and diplomatic swamp facing key negotiators and their mediator, the US

secretary of state, John Kerry.



In a high-profile dismissal of the embryonic process, Israel's former foreign

minister Avigdor Lieberman, wrote on Facebook that there was "no solution to the

Israeli-Palestinian conflict, at least not in the coming years, and what's

possible and important to do is conflict-management".



Naftali Bennett, economics minister, insisted construction on Jewish settlements

in the West Bank and East Jerusalem would continue, regardless of talks.



The comments by two crucial coalition partners are a sign of hostility within

the government over the agreement for preliminary talks forged by Kerry on

Friday.



Meanwhile, a veteran Palestinian negotiator, Yasser Abed Rabbo, denied that a

firm decision had been taken to enter talks, saying the Palestinians were still

discussing terms with Kerry. According to a Palestinian source, Kerry had

written a letter giving a US assurance that the basis of territorial talks would

be the pre-1967 border, but it was not clear whether the letter had been

delivered.



"If we have well-defined terms of reference and a clear time frame - by which we

mean the end of the year - we will go into talks," the source said.



Among the few formal statements of the day, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin

Netanyahu, told cabinet colleagues that resuming the diplomatic process was "a

vital strategic interest of the State of Israel, first of all because we want

peace". However, any agreement would be put to a referendum, he added.



The Israeli president, Shimon Peres, congratulated his Palestinian counterpart

on "a brave and historic decision to return to negotiations". He added: "Don't

listen to the sceptics, you did the right thing."



Among the sceptics were Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza, which described any

engagement in talks by the Palestinian leadership as a "betrayal".



There was no firm indication of when talks in Washington might begin. Kerry said

on Friday that if everything went "as expected" the first meeting would take

place "within a week or so".



The main sticking point continues to be the Palestinian demand that the pre-1967

borders form the baseline for territorial negotiations, a guarantee which Israel

refuses to give. If Kerry fails to persuade the Palestinians they have firm US

backing on the issue, talks may fail to get off the ground. There is also

disagreement over the timeframe. Israel is pushing for negotiations to last up

to a year, fuelling concern among critics who believe Netanyahu is seeking to

give the appearance of diplomatic co-operation while stalling for as long as

possible on any outcome.



Any likely agreed time frame will take the Palestinians well beyond the

potential flashpoint of the UN general assembly in September, at which they

could renew their efforts to become a member state of the global body, a move

fiercely opposed by Israel and the United States.



Both sides agreed to refrain from commenting on the negotiations. "Even people

closest to the (Palestinian) leadership know very little," said Ghassan Khatib,

former director of communications for the Palestinian Authority. "The thing that

bothers me is that it seems that the resumption of negotiations is seen as an

objective in itself. But the problem was never the lack of negotiations, direct

or indirect. It is the huge gap between Israel's stated position and its

practices, and the lack of willingness by the US to put pressure on them."



A Palestinian source said that the publication of EU guidelines on Friday

banning funding or grants to Israeli bodies with links to settlements was

"decisive" in persuading the Palestinians to take the first steps back to

negotiations.



Meanwhile, Tzipi Livni, Israel's justice minister and representative in the

Kerry-brokered talks, has urged the EU to designate the Lebanese militant group

Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation. Writing in the Guardian, Livni says: "A

firm distinction between legitimate, non-violent political parties and terrorist

organisations is crucial for the survival of freedom, democracy and moderation.

The clear message must be sent to extremists that violence and terrorism is

unacceptable and contradictory to our values, and that legitimacy can only be

gained through the repudiation of violence."

How to leave the EU - and win euros 100,000



BYLINE: Katie Allen



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 26



LENGTH: 289 words





It is not quite a million-dollar question, but economists have a new euros

100,000 topic to tackle - a thinktank is putting up the cash prize for the best

plan for Britain's exit from the European Union.



The Institute of Economic Affairs launches its Brexit Prize today, saying that

"we need to give serious consideration to how the UK could have a prosperous

economy outside the EU given that exit is a serious possibility after the next

election".



The free-market thinktank is inviting entries from individuals and groups and

will award the first prize of euros 100,000 to the best blueprint for the UK

after leaving the EU. Entrants are asked to imagine a referendum has resulted in

an "out" vote and the government has triggered article 50 of the Lisbon treaty.



The judging panel will be chaired by former chancellor Lord Lawson, who recently

claimed the British economy would be better off outside the EU.



The IEA said there was an urgent need to explore the implications for Britain of

a so-called Brexit. The thinktank's Philip Booth said: "The judges believe that

exit from the EU should lead to an outward-looking, freely trading Britain and

not an inward-looking Britain trying to shore up domestic markets and vested

interests."



It is inviting 2,000-word submissions by a 16 September. A shortlist will then

be given more time to submit between 10,000 and 20,000 words to the judging

panel, which includes historian David Starkey and Labour MP Gisela Stuart.



The Brexit prize follows a similar competition run by the thinktank Policy

Exchange to find the least disruptive way to organise a breakup of the euro. The

£250,000 Wolfson Prize went to economist Roger Bootle, from Capital Economics,

who is now on the IEA's judging panel.

Front: Tories go level with Labour as Ukip slumps: Alarm for Miliband as

Conservatives hit best poll rating since March 2012



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour Political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 1046 words





The Conservatives have surged to sit alongside Labour in the polls for the first

time in nearly 18 months, largely owing to a sharp fall in support for Ukip,

according to the latest ICM monthly poll for the Guardian.



Labour will be alarmed that the two main parties are neck and neck despite the

economy showing only tentative signs of starting to recover.



ICM's telephone poll last month showed a strong Labour lead of seven points, but

this month the Tories are benefiting from the continuing collapse in support for

Ukip, down from 18% in May - just after its local election success - to 12% in

June and now just 7%.



The shares of the vote are Conservatives 36% (+7 on last month), Labour 36% (no

change), Liberal Democrats 13% (+1), Ukip 7% (-5), and others 8% (-2).



It is the best result for the Tories in an ICM poll since they led by three

points in March 2012, just before George Osborne's mishandled budget presaged a

series of other errors across the government machine.



The fall in the Ukip share may reflect the recent comparative decline in

publicity for the party's leader, Nigel Farage, and Downing Street's persistent

efforts to neutralise Ukip's appeal by countering with a series of strong

messages on immigration, welfare and a referendum on UK membership of the

European Union.



It may also suggest that Ukip support is in part a protest vote exercised in

relatively unimportant local elections and that this support dissipates once the

protest has been registered.



Ukip is likely to argue that the drop in support has not been reflected in most

other polls. At the weekend four online polls showed Ukip support in the high

teens, but a new Populus poll showed Ukip on 10%.



Farage's party will also be banking on a big resurgence of interest during the

European parliament elections next June, when it will hope to come first in

terms of national share of the vote.



The ICM poll findings do not appear to reflect any change in the underlying

support for Labour since the party's standing of 36% remains unchanged on last

month - although party supporters may hope to dismiss it as an outlier.



By contrast, the running YouGov daily online poll shows Labour leading by about

11 points, a hardening in its ratings after an apparent softening in the

previous fortnight.



The ICM poll also contains a clear warning for the chancellor: two-thirds (65%)

do not believe his promise, made last week, that the deficit can be cut after

the election without raising taxes.



There is a majority scepticism on this issue across the political spectrum, with

57% of people who voted Conservative in 2010 agreeing (2010 Lab, 70%; 2010 Lib

Dem, 75%).



That suggests the Tories will struggle to damage Ed Miliband and Ed Balls in the

next election campaign simply by warning of a Labour tax bombshell if elected.



The findings may also reflect the unwillingness of any voter to answer

positively if asked a question that implies the respondent trusts a politician.



At the weekend the Lib Dem business secretary, Vince Cable, threw a new argument

into the likely election tax and spending debate by saying he did not believe

the last Labour government had spent too much in the run-up to the banking

crash, but instead had failed to regulate banking.



Other Lib Dems, including the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, have

persistently argued that the deficit was created by Labour overspending before

2008.



But overall, the Conservatives will be delighted with the ICM findings.

Conservatives are convinced that as growth picks up over the next 12 months, the

polls will swing decisively to them.



Cameron is also due to take the cabinet to a celebratory "away day" at Chequers

on Thursday, where they are expected to hear political as well as government

briefings before parliament goes into recess. A reshuffle in the ministerial

ranks outside cabinet, which had been pencilled in for this week, now looks

likely to take place in the autumn.



Conservative ministers are privately sceptical that they have drawn level with

Labour yet, basing their judgment on other polls and doorstep response. They

still maintain it will be very hard to win an overall Commons majority.



Ed Miliband's brother, David, in a valedictory TV interview at the weekend,

cautioned against the conventional wisdom that a hung parliament was likely

after the next election. The British public may move decisively in favour of one

of the main parties, he said, adding that there was still a "great danger" they

might choose the Tories.



Lib Dems will be concerned at the absence of any sign in the ICM poll that their

overall vote is picking up, despite the decline in Ukip support.



The findings appear to confirm the Lib Dems are no longer seen as a protest

party, making it harder to win a new constituency.



Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary, will today publish the

result of a Cabinet Office-led review into a replacement for the Trident nuclear

deterrent. The ICM poll shows the public split on the issue.



Three in 10 (31%) think Trident should be replaced (rising to 45% of those who

voted Tory in 2010), while an identical number (31%) think it should be slimmed

down (rising to 37% among 2010 Lib Dem voters) and 30% think we should no longer

have any deterrent (39% among Labour 2010 voters).



In his speech, Alexander is to back a limited replacement.



The poll also shows all three party leaders have judged the public mood

correctly by rejecting the 10% increase in MPs' pay from 2015 proposed by the

parliamentary watchdog. The proposed rise would take MPs' pay to £74,000 in

2015.



The public believe MPs should be paid a shade over £50,000 (£51,620 on average).

Men are happier to pay more - at £54,000 - while women think MPs should be paid

£49,000. A clear correlation between social grade and pay was revealed: those in

the most affluent group, AB, suggest MPs should get £58,000, C1s suggest

£55,000, C2s £46,000 and DEs £45,000. Lib Dem voters are the most generous

(£61,000), as are people living in the south (£54,000).



ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,003 adults aged 18+ by telephone

on 12-14 July 2013. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results

have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British

Polling Council and abides by its rules.

&#10002;Solidarity was the watchword in the SWP, but that was probably before

the uproar over its failure to properly address allegations of sexual misconduct

involving a senior official. Over the weekend, things have got much worse. "The

SWP's national committee met on Sunday 7 July 2013 and voted by 26-6 to suspend

four comrades and make wider moves to shut down any organised opposition to the

party leadership," reads a statement signed by 165 comrades. "This move is a

smokescreen. It is a deliberate attempt by the leadership to escalate the crisis

rather than address the critical problems facing the party." Since the

allegations gained wide circulation, the statement says, more than "400 people

have resigned their party membership", the "overwhelming majority" of student

members have walked, and more than 15 party workers have been sacked or

resigned. Roll up, roll up. Watch the party implode.



&#10002;Some rejoicing within the BBC, meanwhile, after Friday's item about the

travails of hard-working foreign correspondents suddenly supplanted by the

arrival of world affairs editor John Simpson. One senior source reminds us of

the solace apparently offered to a victim. "Consider this like a trip to the

dentist dear boy. Undoubtedly painful, but over quickly."



&#10002;He was ever the plain speaker, but on other occasions, as we reported

here, BBC types do resort to euphemism. Last week we told of the campaign to

persuade them to describe waterboarding plainly as "torture" rather than the

current "harsh interrogation technique". Reflecting on their apparent reluctance

to do so, we invited reader suggestions on other euphemisms for acts of state

brutality. Philip Howells emails, full of ideas: stress positions re-imagined as

"muscle definition therapy"; the rack - a "toning extension table"; and shock

treatment, that's "electrical genital excitement". You don't work for the BBC,

do you Philip?



&#10002;Ministers, meanwhile, try to get to grips with immigration. Tory peer

Lord Selsdon attempts to discern the numbers. "The best way to do it is to ask

the immigrants themselves," he tells fellow peers. "This morning I was woken up

as usual by 11 Romanian builders. I complained to them that there was a chap at

the end of the road who was one of those who sells you the gold ring that he

drops on the ground. You pick it up and it has got '19' on it, and he says, 'Can

you give me some money?' And you say: 'Are you an illegal immigrant?'"

Presumably; taken aback, they confess. "All these immigrant groups, once they

are established, become extraordinarily British," he says. "And they want to

educate their children; above all, they want to see things bettered. If you are

looking at televisions, audiovisual, it is the Caribbean that has the skills."

He is quite the expert isn't he?



&#10002;Things are looking up for our Eurosceptic man of the moment, Professor

Alan Sked, as he plots the creation of his new centre-left party to give Ukip a

run for its money. With our help he's gaining traction. All that talk of almost

nude dancing at student parties he organised doesn't seem to be damaging him at

all. "Graham Stringer MP and David Nuttall MP have asked me to join the advisory

council of the Democracy Movement", the all-party campaign that is being

organised to pursue a "moderately expressed and well-researched campaign" for a

no vote in any referendum, he tells us. The Greek United Popular Front has also

been in touch. It has asked Sked to address a rally in Athens alongside Michael

Moore, Noam Chomsky, and Naomi Klein etc. The Front wants to get Greece out of

the euro and the EU. And if there's an after party, watch out.



&#10002;Finally, in light of the weekend's sporting development, some related

reading. Where to start? Should it be "Why Andy Murray Will Never Win a Grand

Slam", from the authoritative US website the Bleacher Report from October 2011.

Or Tennis News, reporting the verdict of Russian ace Nikolay Davydenko "Nikolay

Davydenko thinks that Andy Murray can never win a Grand Slam title." Don't rush,

read both. Enjoy!

National: Unanimous backing for referendum on EU as most Labour MPs abstain:

Hague attacks Miliband's 'shambles and confusion': Alexander says Tory bill

comes from divided party



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt, Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 512 words





MPs voted unanimously - by 304 votes- in favour of a parliamentary bill that

would pave the way for a referendum on Britain's EU membership by 2017 after the

vast majority of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs boycotted the debate.



William Hague, the foreign secretary, accused Labour of lacking courage after Ed

Miliband did not take part and advised his MPs to abstain in the vote.



The Labour and Lib Dem decision meant that the private member's bill, promoted

by the Tory backbencher James Wharton, won the rare distinction of winning a

second reading with unanimous support. The vote was triggered after Peter Luff

and Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, two Tory MPs who support the bill, agreed to act as

tellers for the no votes.



The number of votes in favour exactly matches the number of Conservative MPs who

faced a three-line whip to support the bill. But not every Tory voted in favour.

The numbers were boosted by a handful of Labour supporters.



Hague was scathing about the Labour leadership. He told the BBC: "They didn't

have the courage to vote for or against it and that suggests that at later

stages, they will try to block this in various ways."



The shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, dismissed David Cameron's

"arbitrary" plan to hold a vote in 2017 but declined to rule out a referendum,

saying Labour would be governed by the national interest.



Hague said of Labour: "With some in favour, some against, some adamantly for not

having one, some adamantly for deciding later at some point, perhaps before the

general election but who knows - with such a shambles of confusion and weak

leadership, no wonder (Labour MPs) are wondering what they are here for and

where their leader is now. One day Unite (the trade union) will give them the

orders of how to vote."



David Cameron fully supports the Wharton bill, which, in the absence of Liberal

Democrat support for a government measure, is the only way in which the Tories

can vote in favour of the prime minister's 2017 referendum pledge.



The Labour leadership is embarking on an intense debate on whether to embarrass

Downing Street by tabling an amendment to call for a referendum before the 2015

general election. Some senior figures warn this would be irresponsible because

it would jeopardise Britain's EU membership.



Alexander, who mocked the prime minister for changing his position after saying

in 2006 that the Conservative party should stop "banging on" about Europe, said:

"(This) bill reflects an arbitrary date unrelated to the likely timetable of

major treaty change. It . . . is brought forward by a party divided between

those seeking consent and those seeking exit."



A series of Labour MPs, including the former ministers Frank Field and Keith

Vaz, said they would vote in favour of the referendum bill.



Kenneth Clarke, the pro-European former chancellor, was the only Tory cabinet

minister who did not vote in favour of the bill. A spokeswoman for Clarke said:

"Mr Clarke has been on a short leave of absence for family health reasons."

Leading Article: EU referendum: Gesture politics



BYLINE: Editorial



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 36



LENGTH: 667 words





There are serious questions in politics. And there are silly questions.

Britain's place in the European Union is a serious question of the first order.

So, possibly with some reservations, is a referendum on continued British

membership of the EU. But James Wharton MP's European Union (referendum) bill,

on which the massed ranks of Conservative MPs will vote at Westminster today,

does not raise a serious question at all. Instead, this attempt to bind the next

parliament to hold a referendum in 2017 is a sideshow, even by the standards of

the farce that now passes for Conservative party debate on Europe. It is a silly

stunt, nothing more and nothing less, and the closer the day of the vote has

come, the sillier it has looked.



It is less than six months since David Cameron - a Conservative leader who once

sensibly warned his party against banging on about Europe - went to the City of

London and banged on that a future Tory government would hold a referendum on UK

membership of the EU in 2017. This was meant to cement Mr Cameron's control over

his party over Europe. But in May, after Ukip electoral successes had put the

wind up the Tory party (much of which believes Ukip is right about leaving the

EU anyway), a succession of serving and former ministers said they want Britain

out, while more than 100 Tory MPs then voted for a stronger referendum pledge.

Mr Cameron, who had previously opposed the idea of legislating in this

parliament for a referendum in the next one, promptly published a bill to make

it happen, which Mr Wharton has now picked up as a piece of private member's

legislation. Even more bizarrely, Mr Cameron has insisted that all Tory MPs must

support it, on a three-line whip. As a constitutional position it is a nonsense,

because no parliament can bind its successors. As an exercise in leadership it

has been shameful.



Politics, though, is a fickle business. The same Conservatives who lost their

heads over Europe and plotted against Mr Cameron in May have now rather lost

their interest in the bill which they once deemed to be so crucial to his

leadership. Just conceivably, this may have something to do with the recent

drop-off in poll support and publicity for Ukip. Fear of Ukip on the Tory

benches has not disappeared but it has certainly declined. At any event, as the

second reading of the Wharton bill loomed, the EU referendum issue has been

relegated to the margins. There is no drumbeat of expectation about the outcome

of today's vote and no head of steam in the rightwing press either. None of the

Europhobes on the Tory backbenches who used to make Mr Cameron's life a misery

have made any trouble for him. Instead, Mr Cameron and his backbenchers are all

having a barbecue in the Downing Street garden. The skewers will stay in the

kebabs.



It is just as well that expectations have been lowered about today's vote.

Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs have adopted the simple expedient of going back

to their own constituencies as usual this Friday, thus denying Mr Wharton the

chance to inflate this exercise into a major political event. They are right to

do so, because today's vote is a masquerade. It is up to the voters what the

2015 parliament looks like and whether it holds a referendum on the EU. It is

not up to a Tory parliamentary party which does not even have a majority in this

parliament to make that choice. Mr Wharton will presumably win the vote today.

But it will be an entirely hollow achievement.



This is emphatically not serious politics or serious government. It is not even

serious as an exercise in party management. The parliamentary Conservative party

posed for a team photograph on the green benches at Westminster last night. But

divisions on Europe between those who want to leave and those who want to stay

remain as large as ever. Europe remains a fundamental and serious question in

British life - as the head of the CBI rightly argued again this week. But the

Tory party no longer has anything serious to say about it.

Shadow cabinet split on EU referendum tactics



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour Political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 9



LENGTH: 479 words





Conservative MPs start the long process of securing an in-out referendum on the

EU by 2017 today, amid growing signs Labour may try to trump the Tories by

backing a similar vote before the general election.



Hundreds of Tory MPs will turn up at Westminster to vote for the second reading

of a bill to introduce a referendum by 2017, which is sponsored by the

Conservative MP James Wharton.



The Guardian disclosed last week that Labour was considering an amendment to the

bill to propose a pre-2015 date for the referendum. The shadow cabinet is

discussing the possibility, but Ian Austin, a shadow transport minister and a

close ally of senior shadow cabinet members, has already used a newspaper

article to back a pre-election date.



If Labour does decide to go ahead with the amendment, it will not table it until

the Commons report stage in late autumn, and the bill should pass its second

reading relatively easily.



A Labour amendment would pose a dilemma for Tory MPs, many of whom support an

early referendum but have been willing so far to co-operate with David Cameron's

strategy of trying to negotiate treaty changes, and stage a referendum by 2017

if they are not made.



Influential figures such as Liam Fox may speak in today's debate , which would

mark a rare intervention since he resigned as defence secretary. Fox, one of 12

sponsors of the Wharton bill, has said he has no fears about life outside the

EU. He would be one of many MPs who would have to think seriously if Labour

tabled their amendment.



Wharton himself has said that any amendments are likely to kill the bill as it

needs to be changed as little as possible if it is to reach the statute book as

a private member's bill. Any move by Labour to force an earlier date for a

referendum would also cause Cameron to think about how he could kill off the

bill.



The shadow cabinet is deeply divided on how to proceed. Ed Miliband has insisted

there is no need to make a decision on a referendum now, reasoning that

discussion of such a possibility could jeopardise the country's economic

recovery and put potential investors off. That view is strongly shared by the

shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander.



Austin, a long time ally of the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, wrote in the

Express and Star: "The truth is that the UK needs to decide and I would prefer

to do so more quickly. I know this is not Labour party policy but my view is

that we should have a referendum next year on the same day as the European

elections."



He added that he would personally keep the free-trade single market, but thinks

that "we should decide social legislation for ourselves". Austin insists he is

setting out his own views and not acting on anyone else's behalf.



No 10 responded to the speculation about Labour by saying the PM's views on a

date were unchanged and he would urge people to support the position he had set

out.

G2: Croatia: a portrait of our new neighbours: The latest EU member state has

plenty of problems - but it also has miles of fantastic coastline, great food

and a wealth of culture, says James Hopkin. How will joining Europe change it?



BYLINE: James Hopkin



SECTION: GUARDIAN FEATURES PAGES; Pg. 10



LENGTH: 1549 words





Idemo, Hrvatska! Let's go, Croatia! The country's image is being recast by

travel writers dazzled by the Adriatic and charmed by the

mitteleuropa-meets-the-Balkans cultural diversity of its cities. And by young

visitors with no recollection of the early 1990s - the domovinski rat, or

homelands war of 1991-1995 - who have spread the word about Croatia as a

Mediterranean



country with an appetite for good food, good wine and plenty of opportunities to

party. An accession party, perhaps? Not exactly. Though there were concerts and

fireworks across the country on Sunday night, most were happy to settle for

raising a glass of prosek or rakija (Croatian dessert wine/grappa) in a toast

that was more in hope than optimism.



As Lela Vujanic, who works for the Ministry of Culture, told me with a cheeky

smile: "Accession is July 1. First we'll go to the coast for our holidays. Then

we'll come back in September and riot."



In the meantime, Croatia has been cleaning up its act. Last November, former

prime minister Ivo Sanader was sentenced to 10 years for corruption. And though

there's a nationwide campaign by the conservative NGO group, In the Name of the

Family (backed by the catholic church), calling for a referendum to outlaw

same-sex marriages, there is a new sense of solidarity among Croatia's

centre-left majority, making the referendum feel like the valedictory gesture of

a somewhat



antiquated right wing.



That said, the country's kukuriku (Croatian onomatopoeia for "cock-a-doodle-do")

centre-left coalition government is - like most coalitions - a little muddled at

the moment, according to Danko Radaljac, a columnist for the Novi List

newspaper. "It seems they were pretty much unprepared for taking over." Yet he

is all for accession.



"If we stayed out of the EU, we would be back in the Balkans," he said. "My

country in 2013 is in a much better condition than in 2002, when the accession

process started. The justice system is much better, human rights are on a much

higher level, and the protection of consumer rights just didn't exist 11 years

ago. Sure, we have our eurosceptics, as all countries do, and they are very

loud, but the majority of people are pro-EU, because there are many more

benefits than disadvantages."



Unemployment is currently 7.7% in Zagreb, and a staggering 21% in the rest of

the country, whereas the average net monthly wage is 6,400 kuna (£731) in

Zagreb, and 5,500 kuna (£628) elsewhere. Prices are high with VAT at 25%, and

designer labels at UK prices - extraordinary considering the wage difference.



In Rovinj, a lovely 14th-century Venetian city on the west coast of Istria, I

met Mauro Massarotto, the founder of successful Croatian company,

Sheriff&Cherry. Their main exports are Startas, white trainers in a

hand-stitched 1970s Yugo style, and hipster-friendly sunglasses. Significantly,

Massarotto took on ailing factories in both his hometown and in war-scarred

Vukovar.



During a brief tour of Rovinj, he pointed out the ugly new roof over the

traditional market - "It's a bus-station roof!" - and the supermarket sullying

the entrance of an old cinema. He criticised the uninspired designs of most

local government planning, and complained they always choose the cheapest

tender. These are problems I have heard of throughout the country: the

in-fighting between local government and powerful magnates, the poor

communication between the regions and Zagreb resulting in tribalism and

nepotism, the excessive bureaucracy, and the lack of support for creative

spirits.



Ivana is processing EU funding applications in Croatia. She told me that her

country has not yet utilised the full amount available. Why? "A fear of

paperwork, of taking responsibility. Also, the EU wants clean ownership of

applicant properties whereas here, property ownership is complicated, and often

shared. In our cities, I'd say only about 35% have 'clean documents'."



Other applicants withdrew when they discovered they would have to pay for their

projects up front, and only later would the EU reimburse them.



Like the rest of Europe, Croatia's economy is in trouble, but with a population

of only 4.4 million, that hardship is felt even more keenly. In sun-blessed

Dalmatia, EU regulations will threaten traditional fishing methods, and there is

a fear across Croatia that long-held production methods may be outlawed due to

strictures coming from Brussels that fail to take into account time-tested local

customs.



Or communities. In Dubrovnik, the indigenous old-town population of 4,000 has

dropped to 700 as foreigners buy up flats. During the summer, cruisers disgorge

15,000 passengers a day to cram along the polished white-stone main street,

Stradun, while a controversial new golf course (for the world's business

tycoons) will occupy a site 20 times the size of the old town. Ordinary

Croatians are resentful that they cannot afford to visit.



Aside from Dubrovnik - "an oasis of capitalism even during socialism" as one

businessman told me - the abundant beauty of coastal Croatia ensures a healthy

income from June to September (with Brits the fastest growing group) and then

heads into hibernation. Many locals flock back to Zagreb for the winter. There's

a hope that EU membership will engender year-round tourism, not to mention

radically increased investment across the country.



However, with economics having failed to unite the continent, there is a growing

recognition that culture is the best way to help re-define concept Europe.

Contemporary Croatian literature, in particular, is fast gaining recognition.

Josip Novakovich was recently shortlisted for the Man Booker international

prize, as was Dasa Drndic for the Independent foreign fiction prize. Then

there's Robert Perisic, Slavenka Drakulic, and Zoran Feric.



Zagreb is crammed with cultural sites, including the impressive new Museum of

Contemporary Art, and in spring and autumn the city is alive with weekly

festivals such as the Subversive film festival (this year speakers included

Oliver Stone and Slavoj ciuek).



As usual with new accession countries, though, won't some be tempted to leave?



"Should I stay or should I go? is now the most frequent question among those

under 40," Lela Vujanic told me. "For eastern Europeans who have lived both

systems, the problem is there is no longer a dream place to run to."



This is an important point. The EU is certainly not what it was 10 years ago;

there are no longer any safe havens. I lived in Poland before and during their

accession, and I watched as its cities were transformed by infrastructure

projects, while many Poles fled to the UK. Now thriving, Poland was lucky: they

got in before the recession. The outlook is not nearly so auspicious for new

member states.



"We survived the war," added Lela, "but now life has become hard again."



Rijeka - known as Vrata Jadrana, the Gateway to the Adriatic - was once a major

port under the Austro-Hungarian Empire (the self-propelled torpedo was invented

there), and remained an important industrial centre subsidised by the Yugoslav

government. When that came to an end, the industries started collapsing, leaving

high unemployment and a growing despair. Walking the city with Tea Tulic, a

32-year-old novelist, we saw an elderly man going through the bins. "That would

never have happened in the 80s," she said.



In famously leftwing Rijeka, in particular, and perhaps in Croatia, in general,

there is a deep nostalgia for the era of full employment, of bigger markets

across the states of the former Yugoslavia, before the war, when all ethnicities

lived side by side, and the ghost of Tito (he died in 1980) continued to unite

the Balkans - though Rijeka is still well-known for its tolerance, and there is

a sizeable Serb population.



Like Rijeka, Istria is part of "red Croatia" but this time not just because of

its political persuasion, but because of its fertile red soil. Inland Istria is

all rolling green landscapes, vineyards and olive groves, forests and

truffle-rich plains, not to mention the exquisite medieval hilltop towns of

Groznjan and Motovun, the latter well known for its film festival. Because of

its proximity to the Italian and Slovenian borders, the region has a decidedly

European outlook.



Luciano Visintin is the owner of the Veralda vineyards in Brtonigla.



"Istria is not a region, it's a community," he corrected me. "There is no

competition. I don't say: oh, I have 20 hectares more than you." He hopes EU

membership will widen his market. "The future is in our indigenous grape," he

said, with conviction, before uncorking a bottle of his new rose brut champagne.



Luciano explained how four generations of his family have been born in the same

house, though each under a different regime. "My grandfather in 1915 under the

Austro-Hungarian empire, my father in 1942 under the Italians, myself in 1968 in

the former Yugoslavia, and my son in 1998 in the Independent Republic of

Croatia. And we didn't even move!" he laughed.



"You only had to change the flag outside the window," I said.



"No!" he laughed again. "We never put up a flag. You never know who might be

looking!"

Tory pleads for no amendments to his EU referendum bill



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 315 words





Tory supporters of an EU referendum need to broaden their cross-party support

and show great discipline if the bill introducing an in-out referendum by 2017

is to reach the statute book, the bill's sponsor declared yesterday.



Conservative MP James Wharton said the bill's second reading on Friday would be

straightforward because of Labour and Liberal Democrat abstentions, but he added

that "in the longer run, we do need a broader base of support".



In a message to the ardent Eurosceptics on his own benches, Wharton, MP for

Stockton South on Teesside, said he needed to make sure no amendments were

tabled if the bill was to reach the Lords by the late autumn. He said: "The best

chance of it going through is if it is unamended, so I discourage colleagues

from all sides from tabling amendments."



John Mills, the founder of the Labour campaign for a referendum, claimed half of

the shadow cabinet and at least a third of all Labour MPs now privately

supported Labour backing a referendum at the next election. Labour is abstaining

on the bill's second reading, but Mills believes that if David Cameron were less

eager to exploit Labour's opposition to an in-out referendum, the party's

leader, Ed Miliband, might be persuaded to shift his stance.



But Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, insisted his party

had remained consistent in saying it did not support a referendum. Whenever a

referendum came, he said, his party would be backing Britain remaining in the

EU.



He said: "The Liberal Democrats have been consistent throughout; the

Conservatives have changed. They now want to pluck a slightly arbitrary date in

the diary out of thin air to have a referendum on a very ill-defined process of

so-called renegotiation.



"We have a clear position. We are not going to waste . . . time helping the

Conservatives indulge in their own internal feuds in the Commons on Friday."

Comment: Tories need to be wary of rewarding smug marrieds: The middle classes

deserve a tax break, but this won't help problem families and it puts MPs'

marriages under scrutiny



BYLINE: Melissa Kite



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 20



LENGTH: 906 words





Bridget Jones was never going to get a tax break out of David Cameron. The prime

minister believes in marriage, and he wants to introduce a married couples' tax

break to prove it. After much prevarication, owing to the political difficulties

of getting the policy through, Cameron is now bringing forward to the autumn

legislation to recognise marriage in the tax system.



So all you Bridget Joneses out there can now add to your list of grievances the

fact that you won't qualify for a tax rebate that your smug married friends will

be boasting about.



I know Cameron believes in this policy personally and passionately because I

once sat in the back of a car with him and listened to him nagging a

twentysomething female aide about why she hadn't yet found a husband. "We really

must get you married. Marriage is wonderful," he said, with great feeling.



It may yet be the case that in rushing out an announcement on this most

traditional policy, against the wishes of ministers including George Osborne,

Cameron shows himself to be in tune with the British people - who have a soft

spot for marriage and want it promoted.



Certainly, the prime minister has done himself proud recently by sticking to

instinctive Tory values. His stance on Europe and welfare cutbacks - both of

which Labour predicted would be unpopular - have won enthusiastic backing from

voters. Ed Miliband has looked out of touch in refusing to back an EU referendum

and by not having a cohesive alternative to counter financial austerity. Polling

last weekend showed the Labour party leader lacking the power to secure a

Commons majority.



But there is something about a marriage tax break that makes me doubt its

populist appeal. Perhaps because I am a singleton myself, I have deeply

conflicted feelings about financially rewarding "smug marrieds", as Bridget

Jones calls them.



I don't oppose it completely, however, because whatever the idealist Cameron

believes, a married couples' tax break is essentially a tax break for the middle

classes. The reason the idea has gathered so much pace within the Tory party,

which was poised to revolt if Cameron did not act, is because it is the only

way, in the current financial climate, the Conservatives can legitimately - and

with moral authority - get a tax cut through for "people like them". In

principle that is fine by me. The middle classes deserve a tax break. They've

been paying into the system more diligently than anyone else for years.



My problem is that if you want to give middle Britons some of their hard-earned

money back, give it to them honestly and up front. Say you want to reward

responsible people on medium incomes and be done with it.



The problem with dressing up a tax cut for the middle classes as "marriage tax

breaks" is that it excludes some very worthy groups of people, namely wives

deserted by their husbands, husbands deserted by their wives and the children of

those sad, broken unions. It also further stigmatises that fast-growing

demographic - the single person who fails, through no fault of their own, to

find a mate. To judge if a taxpayer deserves some slack according to whether or

not they have persuaded a partner to walk down the aisle seems very arbitrary

when fewer people than ever make a go of wedlock.



Ah but, the marriage tax proponents say, if only marriage carried tax incentives

it would be more popular and last longer. Would these enthusiasts please point

me to one example of a separated couple they can honestly say would rediscover

their love of each other if they were given £150 a year. Bickering, angry,

resentful lovers do not stay together for the sake of an extra £12.50 a week

(the sum mooted when the idea was in the Tory manifesto).



More pertinently, perhaps, this policy has no effect on the problem families we

really need to help lower down the socio-economic scale. Take the young couple I

saw in my local park in south London the other day, screaming at each other in

front of their frightened toddler: she accusing him of beating her up, he barely

able to walk or speak, presumably because of the influence of drink or drugs.

These are the couples we need to make stable, but the reality of their lives

will not be altered by telling them they can share a tax-free allowance. Married

couples are a self-selecting social group.



As I say, I don't mind rewarding the middle classes per se. But there is one

more reason why the Conservative party should be cautious. The spectre of "back

to basics". You pose an interesting moral question as a politician if you reward

marriage through the tax and benefits system. You inevitably draw attention to

your own union. You put the spotlight on the marriages of those in the cabinet

and, indeed, of all MPs who vote through such legislation. Suddenly, rumours of

a "high-profile affair in Downing Street" might become all the more intriguing.

Whispers about a senior cabinet minister who has had a fling and put his wife

through hell become more than gossip. They become an important part of a policy

debate.



Is marriage a state-sponsored benefit, a matter for public policy, or a

well-intentioned but fraught personal arrangement that a growing number of

couples are finding hard to abide by?



To wit: do you take this marriage tax break as your lawfully wedded policy, to

have and to hold through scurrilous tabloid revelations? It is a brave

politician who says "I do".

Comment: A blue referendum: Cameron's meddling will deny us all the chance to

vote on the EU, in spite of cross-party support



BYLINE: John Mills



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 21



LENGTH: 613 words





On Friday MPs will vote on whether to give the British people their first say on

the European Union for almost 40 years. The EU referendum private members' bill

being proposed by Conservative MP James Wharton could have been a great moment

for Britain's parliament, undermined in recent years by expenses and lobbying

scandals. It could have been one of those critical moments when MPs put aside

partisan differences for the common good. But it won't be.



The Conservatives have chosen to make their bill all blue. One by one, Labour

MPs who joined us in supporting the Labour for a Referendum campaign have been

rebuffed. The first prime minister to promise a referendum on the EU since

Harold Wilson is now in danger of becoming a major obstacle to one actually

happening.



The bill will, of course, pass easily on Friday. But it will do so with meagre

cross-party support. Bringing Labour on board would have given it a fighting

chance while it goes through committee and then returns to the Commons for

another vote in the autumn. However, David Cameron's partisan meddling with this

backbencher's bill has left many MPs from other parties in a position where they

feel they simply cannot support it; and that means it will struggle to become

law.



I have spent a good deal of my adult life campaigning for an EU referendum. I

have done so because as a businessman - I founded and am the chair of the

consumer products and shopping channel company JML - I feel the EU too often

hinders and frustrates economic growth in Britain; and because as a British

citizen, I think Brussels intrudes into too many aspects of our daily lives. But

mostly I have done so because the organisation Britain joined in 1973 has become

a very different animal, and it's only right that the general public get their

say on these huge changes.



Regular polls and the meteoric rise of Ukip have shown that Britain's membership

of the EU is a crucial matter not just for Conservative voters. In the past few

months one of the campaigns I chair, Business for Britain, has demonstrated that

there is a strong feeling in the business community that Britain's relationship

with Brussels must undergo a fundamental change. I helped set up Labour for a

Referendum because I feel the Labour party will soon also recognise the

imperative for a new deal from the EU. Indeed, it seems the shadow cabinet is

now seriously considering backing a referendum in the coming months.



Yet, despite all this evidence that the EU issue stretches across partisan,

generational and personal boundaries, the Conservatives have made only scant

effort to embrace this new cross-party reality. Unfortunately, the referendum

bill now looks more like a Tory PR operation than a genuine movement for

constitutional change. Unhappily, it gives greater credence to the suspicion

that Cameron's promise of a referendum in January was not because he believes it

is the right thing to do, but rather because he wanted to placate his vociferous

backbenchers. I'm pleased that Labour's hesitance to match his pledge is

seemingly based on ensuring it would be held at a time that would not be

detrimental to the British economy.



There is still time for Cameron. Time to reach out to Labour and allow James

Wharton to build up the undeniable cross-party support that exists. With greater

numbers of Labour MPs coming around to the idea of a referendum, and party

advisers openly preparing the way for a Labour pledge before 2015, the door is

open for the sort of coalition the country can be proud of to vote through a

referendum and let the people decide on the EU.



But will they dare?

Tories warned over 'all-blue' taint to EU referendum bid



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 433 words





David Cameron will be warned today by proponents of a referendum on EU

membership that he is endangering the success of the campaign by taking an

overly party political approach.



A private member's bill offering a referendum in 2017, promoted by the Tory MP

James Wharton, is due to have its second reading on Friday.



The Labour donor John Mills, a backer of the referendum campaign, says in an

article for the Guardian: "The Conservatives have chosen to make their bill all

blue. One by one, Labour MPs who joined us in supporting the Labour for a

Referendum campaign have been rebuffed.



"Cameron's partisan meddling with this backbencher's bill has left many MPs from

other parties in a position where they feel they simply cannot support it, and

that means it will struggle to become law."



Mills is due to attend a cross-party press briefing on the bill with Wharton and

other Eurosceptic campaigners today. It is understood that some of them are

disturbed that Cameron is playing the bill for Conservative advantage rather

trying to build cross-party support.



In a sign of the prime minister's willingness to put pressure on the other

parties, Cameron challenged Nick Clegg to live up to a Liberal Democrat

manifesto commitment to support a bill on Britain's EU membership.



The prime minister, who confirmed that he would vote in favour of the bill on

Friday, joked that the deputy prime minister had the chance to support his own

policy "once again".



He was speaking in Islamabad a few hours before Danny Alexander, the chief

secretary to the Treasury, said Liberal Democrats would abstain from the debate

on the grounds that the bill was a "parliamentary stunt". But Downing Street is

so serious about the vote that it brought forward the prime minister's overseas

trip in part to allow him to take part on Friday. Tory MPs are facing a

three-line whip to support the bill.



Cameron has to rely on a private member's bill because the Liberal Democrats

denied him government time. The prime minister reminded Clegg that the Lib Dems

pledged to hold a referendum on Britain's EU membership in their manifesto for

the 2010 election. He declined to mention that they qualified the commitment by

saying the referendum should be held if there was a major revision of the Lisbon

treaty.



Asked whether he would be voting on Friday, Cameron said: "I will be there. I

think this is a serious effort by the government - sorry, the Conservative part

of the coalition - to get behind this bill."

Comment: Croatia, lost in translation: Despite the fact that our nation joins

the EU on Monday, we don't seem in the mood to celebrate



BYLINE: Slavenka Drakulic



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 47



LENGTH: 636 words





If Croatia could have chosen the moment for its accession to the European Union,

it would not be 1 July 2013. The Pew Research Centre has just published the

results of polling conducted in eight EU member states. The most disturbing

finding is that the percentage of citizens in favour of the European project has

plummeted from 60% a year ago to 45% now. A failing economy, Europe's

north-south divide and distrust of the political elite have led to such results.



Then there are the consequences of Romania and Bulgaria joining the EU in 2007

without adequate preparation. Disappointment with the two new members was

followed by a more sceptical approach to further accessions. As it is, the EU

has had enough problems with former communist countries, and now yet another one

is joining. Yes, Croatia is smaller and perhaps better prepared, but enthusiasm

is nevertheless lacking on both sides.



When the newly independent nation began the negotiation process, Croatians

regarded the EU like a rich aunt. After all, they always thought of membership

not as coming in but coming back. But even so, the nationalist opposition was

fairly vocal. Why join a new community of states just after leaving Yugoslavia,

and a bloody war that had cost thousands of lives? If the 1991-95 wars were for

independence, then why give up that newly won political sovereignty? And what

about the Croatian national identity that had been reinvented and celebrated

with so much energy by the first president, Franjo Tudjman?



However, the political elite at the time presented it in ideological terms:

Croatia does not belong to the Balkans. The Balkans are the Others - Orthodox

and Muslims, not Catholics. Joining the EU would reinforce the difference, and

"draw the line" between them and us. This must be the only reason Croatia's

Catholic church supported the yes vote in last year's referendum, when 66% voted

to join the EU.



In later years, though, the important if not crucial argument about peace and

stability was neglected more and more. Politicians of both right and left chose

to perpetuate a rosy picture of economic benefits, investments, employment

opportunities and so on. Yet with accession approaching, it became clear that

this was not going to happen. The economic crisis in the EU coincided with

negative results from the badly handled privatisation of state assets, with

allegations of political corruption. The state bureaucracy is huge and no reform

has touched it. Unemployment climbed to 20% and is still rising. Over half those

unemployed are young people. The public debt is almost 60% of GDP. No wonder

Germany fears Croatia is a future Greece.



Croatians themselves seem not to be in the mood to celebrate. In this last month

before joining the EU, the media expressed anxiety, for instance about the

likely competitiveness of our products - although our main industry, tourism, is

doing well. One could sense an atmosphere of closing instead of opening, of fear

instead of joy.



The only people looking forward to joining the EU seem to be young people, who

anticipate the possibilities of study and work abroad - there will be no more

customs at our western borders, no more queueing up in non-EU queues for those

who have money to shop and to travel.



It looks as if in the whole process of accession the most important elements

were "lost in transition". Beyond Croatia being Europe's long-lost Catholic

child, the fact is that the country was at war only two decades ago, and that

peace and security should mean more to it than putative economic gains. Economic

survival for this small and poor state would be even harder outside the union.

This is why 1 July is a historic date, even if the actual moment of joining is

really not the best one either for Croatia or for the EU.

German fury at bank bosses' bailout jokes



BYLINE: Henry McDonald



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 27



LENGTH: 506 words





The fallout from the Anglo Irish Bank tapes, with executives singing Deutschland

uber Alles while joking about German money rescuing the financial institution,

has provoked disgust in the country, a senior ally of chancellor Angela Merkel

has said.



Michael Fuchs, deputy leader of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party in the

Bundestag, described the recordings as "unbearable".



In a series of phone calls senior bankers at the toxic, debt-ridden bank laugh

about German largesse on the night the Irish government rescued Anglo Irish Bank

from collapse with large injections of cash from European partners, including

Germany.



The outrage in Germany is deeply embarrassing for the current Fine Gael-Labour

coalition in Dublin as the government seeks to reduce the republic's debt burden

to the EU, the European Central Bank and the IMF.



Fuchs told RTE radio yesterday: "We are offended. If you have a feeding hand you

shouldn't bite into it."



He said the remarks were "really dangerous" language as German politicians were

trying to convince local taxpayers to support European countries, such as

Ireland. "It's absolutely unbearable that somebody is talking like this."



In one conversation - taped two days after the 30 September 2008 bank guarantee

- Anglo Irish Bank's disgraced former CEO David Drumm giggles while his

colleague John Bowe recites lines from "Deutschland uber alles".



Bowe accepted in a statement that the language used in the taped recordings of

internal bank conversations "was imprudent and inappropriate".



The behaviour of the Anglo Irish executives has turned them into national hate

figures in the republic and now, it appears, also in the country which has

supplied most of Europe's money to prop up not only the Irish banking system but

also the entire state.



As Anglo Irish Bank moved towards the fiscal abyss, Drumm is heard joking,

"another day, another billion", referring to the flight of deposits out of the

doomed bank before the bank guarantee in September 2008. At the time the outflow

was running at over euros 1bn (£847m) a day.



Meanwhile, the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, has said he may have to seek a

referendum asking the Irish people for greater government powers to investigate

the banking crash that almost bankrupted Ireland.



Speaking in the Dail the taoiseach said he was considering a second referendum

that would grant the state more power to hold searching inquiries.



The tapes appear to confirm that Anglo Irish bankers hoodwinked the then Fianna

Fail-led government back in 2008 with a vastly underestimated price for the bank

rescue. John Bowe, then the bank's director of capital markets, is heard on the

tapes explaining where got the figure of euros 7bn needed to save Anglo Irish

from oblivion.



He quips that he picked the figure "out of my arse".



In fact, Anglo Irish Bank's rescue cost the Irish and European taxpayers,

particularly the Germans, euros 30bn.

Simon Hoggart's sketch: William the 14-pint-sized politico



BYLINE: Simon Hoggart



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 485 words





William Hague was asked yesterday about the referendum on our membership of the

EU. Gary Streeter, a Tory, pointed out that the last time we had a poll on this

topic Mr Hague was aged only 14 and could not vote.



The foreign secretary replied: "I was only 14, although I had a big influence on

how my family voted even at that stage." This answer seemed to me to open a pit

of horror. A 14-year-old instructing his parents how to vote!



Mrs Hague: Come on, William luv, eat up tha' brawn sandwich! It'll make thee big

and strong!



William: Aye, happen as it will Mam, but tha's not tekking into account the new

pigmeat regime likely to be wished upon us by them Europeans and their fancy

foreign ways if we stay inside t'Common Market, as I still call it. Brawn will

be a thing of t'past, and Yorkshire folk will be forced to spread their Hovis

wi' pate, rillettes, chorizo and other foreign muck!"



Mr Hague, gazing puzzled at his son: Sometimes, William lad, I wonder whether

you wouldn't be happier if you stopped memorising parliamentary majorities seat

by seat, and worrying your head about subsidiarity and such soft southern

nonsense. 'Ave a few drinks wi' some of the lads!



William: Don't worry your head, father, I regularly drink 14 pints of ale a day,

a fact which will emerge after I become Tory leader in 1997! Now I must go back

to my room and rehearse for the keynote speech I plan to make to the

Conservative conference in two years' time . . .



Apart from this alarming scene, MPs were anxious about Syria and David Cameron's

plans to arm the rebels. Many are deeply anxious about this and are demanding a

meaningful vote before it happens. Mr Hague seemed unwilling to say outright

that such a vote would occur. Peter Hain pointed out that the Sunday Times had

quoted "a senior Tory source" who had said: "We will avoid at all costs a vote

as we don't think we can win it".



"There is no Tory more senior than the prime minister," Mr Hague replied, to

delighted cries of "Boris! Boris!" from Labour, whose members never miss a

chance to point out that the mayor of London is the only popular Tory left in

the country.



"One or two might think they are (senior to the prime minister) . . ." Hague

said, emphasising once again that there really is a clandestine leadership

struggle.



He gave a long answer that seemed to imply that there would be a vote, but

didn't quite say so. Julian Lewis, a frequently rebellious Tory, grumped that he

would like to have heard the word "yes" in that answer, but had not done so.

Then some Labour MPs thought Hague had muttered the magic word under his breath.



Gisela Stuart asked for the word "yes" be recorded in Hansard, which would in

effect commit the government to holding a vote. She was unlucky. The Hansard

writers record only what they hear, and clearly they didn't hear that.



Maybe it would have worked better if he had just muttered, "aye, bonny lass",

with a wink.

Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appears to be backing away from a

threatened "final" confrontation to clear thousands of protesters occupying an

Istanbul park, after a series of late-night meetings with representatives of

those involved in street protests which have engulfed dozens of Turkish cities.



In what appeared to be a calculated political move to step back from the violent

confrontations that have left five dead and more than 5,000 injured since

protests erupted in Turkey, Erdogan said yesterday he would suspend plans to

redevelop Gezi Park pending a government court appeal. By offering the

concession Erdogan appears to be counting on the protests fading. The prime

minister had earlier refused to meet with members of Taksim Solidarity.



In a separate development, an Istanbul court released 43 Gezi Park protesters

who had been arrested, meeting another of the demonstrators' demands.



Erdogan's change in tactics comes a day after the European parliament voted to

condemn Turkey for the "harsh measures" used on demonstrators.



Although the largest wave of protests in recent Turkish history was triggered by

a violent crackdown on 31 May on environmental campaigners occupying the park,

the protests have since been transformed into a wider, if loose, coalition of

those opposed to Erdogan and his ruling moderate Islamist AKP, whom they accuse

of creeping authoritarianism.



The promise of a breakthrough emerged in a series of meetings in the capital,

Ankara, and Istanbul. In Ankara, Erdogan met artists and representatives of

Taksim Solidarity, named after the square adjoining Gezi Park that has been the

focus for the worst clashes. Huseyin Celik, deputy chairman of the AKP who

attended the talks, said the meeting had been positive but reiterated Erdogan's

position that the occupation has to end.



"Our government has been very tolerant, as tolerant as it goes in a democracy,

but I don't think the government will leave that place under occupation for

long," he said.



Earlier this week, Taksim Square was cleared by police with water cannon,

teargas and rubber bullets in some of the worst scenes of violence in the

protests.



In Istanbul, the city's governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu also held a five-hour

midnight meeting with young protesters invited via Twitter at a cafe on the

shores of the Bosphorous to hear their complaints.



"We felt they showed sensitivity . . . and did not have an unyielding stance

regarding staying there (in the park)," Mutlu told reporters. Signs of movement

to end the two-week standoff prompted a rally on the Turkish stock market.



Protesters in the park have tentatively welcomed the moves by Erdogan as the

"first positive sign".



Representatives of Taksim Solidarity who attended the meeting said Erdogan had

promised to abide by the outcome of a court case filed in an effort to stop the

redevelopment and would hold a referendum on the plans if the court found in the

government's favour. "The prime minister said that if the results of the public

vote turned out in a way which would leave this area as a park, they will abide

by it," Tayfun Kahraman of the protest group told reporters following the

meeting.



"His comments that the project will not be executed until the judiciary makes

its decision is tonight's positive result."



Taksim Solidarity said in a subsequent statement that it would decide as a whole

what course of action to take after consulting on the results of the overnight

meeting, leaving it unclear whether it would continue protesting.



The pledge by Erdogan - whose party plans rallies in Ankara and elsewhere this

weekend - suggests he has calculated that he can defuse the current political

crisis by putting the onus on the courts, not his own damaged political

reputation, and hope that there is insufficient agreement among those in the

park on other issues for the occupation to continue.



But a poll of those in Gezi Park this week suggested that almost half were there

because of their unhappiness with Erdogan's style of government.

Michael Adler writes: I had the great pleasure of working with Sir Patrick

Nairne (obituary, 6 June) as a fellow trustee of the National Aids Trust.

Despite the many calls on his time, he read every paper in detail and always

offered sharp analytical comments, seeing through difficult problems with ease.

When I came to chair the trust, I relied on him as a friend and adviser.



Patrick's beautifully crafted post-meeting letters discussed what had happened

and what should happen. His italic script was a joy, and put my doctor's writing

to shame. I am the proud owner of one of his watercolours, which he gave to me

as a wedding present.



Richard Jameson writes: Patrick Nairne was responsible for administering the

1975 referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. As an

undersecretary from the Department of Education, I was seconded to head a

referendum unit of six people under his supervision in the Cabinet Office,

responsible to Ted Short (then lord president of the council), for the four

months between Harold Wilson's decision and the vote itself. The work included

passing an act through parliament and supporting secondary legislation, as well

as a host of administrative decisions. Without the leadership of Short and

Nairne, the vote would not have taken place on 5 June 1975.

Turkish protesters vow to ignore PM's 'final warning'



BYLINE: Peter Beaumont in Istanbul



SECTION: GUARDIAN INTERNATIONAL PAGES; Pg. 21



LENGTH: 537 words





Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, delivered a stark "final warning"

yesterday to thousands of defiant protesters still camped out in Istanbul's Gezi

park, demanding that they end their occupation.



Describing the protesters as troublemakers, Erdogan said the government had

reached the "end of its patience" over the continuing demonstrations against his

leadership, in which five people have been killed since 31 May. Erdogan had

earlier issued a 24-hour deadline to clear Taksim Square and Gezi park.



He spoke as the latest person to die in the demonstrations was named as

26-year-old Ethem Sarisuluk, who had been on life support for days. He was

pronounced dead after he was hit in the head by a tear gas canister on 1 June

during a protest in the capital, Ankara.



The protests erupted after a violent police crackdown on 31 May following a

sit-in by activists objecting to a development project that would involve

cutting down the trees in Gezi park and replacing them with a replica of an

Ottoman-era barracks. Since then, protests have spread to dozens of cities and

been transformed into a broader complaint over Erdogan's style of government.



Erdogan also hit out at criticism overseas of the force being used. The European

parliament has voted to condemn the use of "harsh measures" against peaceful

protesters and urged Erdogan to take a unifying and conciliatory stance.



"We have arrived at the end of our patience," Erdogan told local party leaders

in a speech in Ankara yesterday. "I am giving you my final warning."



He urged parents with children at the park to convince them to pack up and go

home. He added that he had instructed police that "we cannot allow lawbreakers

to hang around freely in this square . . . We will clean the square".



Responding to the vote in the European parliament in Strasbourg, Erdogan added:

"I won't recognise the decision that the European Union parliament is going to

take about us . . . Who do you think you are by taking such a decision?"



Although there were no fresh clashes yesterday, many have interpreted Erdogan's

remarks as a clear signal that he will move soon to clear the park of

protesters.



A new poll of those occupying Gezi park suggests that almost 60% are protesting

about Erdogan's style of government, which opponents have criticised for its

creeping authoritarianism.



Despite the warnings, new protesters of all ages continued to arrive in the

camp, insisting they would not be frightened away.



Among them was Kerim Ozken, 63, a retired bank worker and writer. "I think the

police might attack again tonight," he said, reflecting the fears of many in the

camp. "Tayyip (Erdogan) said it will be over tonight. He thinks it is a war. It

is idiotic. Really idiotic. He thinks he can change people's minds by force."



So far during the protests, 5,000 protesters and 600 police have been reported

injured.



Erdogan's defiant tone comes despite the floating of a proposal to have a

popular referendum on the fate of the park. Pouring cold water on that notion, a

senior judge insisted that the courts had already ruled on the development.

Comment: If only Britain had joined the euro: If Gordon Brown had chosen 10

years ago to join the single currency, both the EU and Britain would be stronger

now



BYLINE: Will Hutton



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 38



LENGTH: 1001 words





Ten years ago this week Gordon Brown said no to joining the euro. It is an

anniversary on which Bank of England governor Mervyn King, Ukip's Nigel Farage,

Unite's Len McCluskey and the Guardian's Larry Elliott, along with most of the

British economic establishment, can all agree. On this, Brown was right.



Elliott set out the establishment consensus in a classic piece this month on his

alternative history of what would have happened had Britain joined. Essentially,

he says, there would have been a bigger boom in the runup to 2007 and a more

disastrous bust. Britain would now be struggling to maintain its membership as

anti-EU sentiment mushroomed, prompting its eventual exit, dramatising the

inherent unsoundness of yoking disparate economies into one inflexible currency.



But there is a more optimistic, alternative history. The first obvious point is

that Britain could have joined the euro only if a referendum had been won. A

victory would have depended on it being an obvious good deal, with the pound

entering at a competitive rate and the euro's structure, rules and governance

reformed to accommodate British interests. The European Central Bank would have

needed to look more like the US Federal Reserve, with more scope for fiscal and

monetary activism. The Germans would doubtless have insisted, in return, that

the EU banking system be more conservatively managed.



The last decade would have been very different. What none of the mockers of the

euro ever acknowledge is the economic doomsday machine that Brown created

through not joining. By not locking in a competitive pound, Britain suffered a

decade of chronic sterling overvaluation, made more acute by the City of London

sucking in capital from abroad to finance the extraordinary credit and property

boom of those years.



Imports surged and exports sagged; the economy outside banking either stagnated

or shrank. Much of the best of UK manufacturing was auctioned off to foreigners.

Today we find that, despite a huge currency devaluation, there are just not

enough companies to take advantage of it: too much of the rest of British

capacity, thanks to foreign takeover, has become a part of global supply chains

that are indifferent to exchange-rate variation. Our export response has been

feeble; evidence of the economic orthodoxy's inability to devise policies and

structures that favour production.



Inside the euro, at a competitive exchange rate, Britain's exports would instead

have soared, and its traded goods sector would have expanded, not shrunk.

Regional cities would have boomed around sustainable activity rather than

property and credit. The euro's rules would have meant a less reckless fiscal

policy, and banks would have been more constrained in lending for property. They

would have had to lend proportionately more to fast-growing real enterprise,

reinforced because the new rules would have required them to lend in a more

balanced way.



Britain would have entered the 2008 crisis with a far less unbalanced economy, a

stronger banking system and international accounts, and a government deficit

much less acute. And the reformed eurozone could have responded much more

flexibly and cleverly than it did.



In any case, both Britain and Europe are now wrestling with depressed economic

activity caused by overstretched bank and company balance sheets - and the

exchange-rate regime is hardly the cause of this distress. Germany and the

stronger EU countries are plainly wrong in their overemphasis on austerity as a

solution, but surely right to argue that the only long-term solution is for the

whole of Europe to move to their productivist, stakeholder capitalism.



British mainstream commentators see the obvious fissure between the stronger

European north and the weaker south as proof positive that the euro is fatally

flawed. But suppose countries like Greece or Ireland rise to the German

challenge? Already there are encouraging auguries in both. If so,

notwithstanding excessive austerity, they could weather the crisis, and become

stronger.



There is plainly a chance one or more countries could leave, but there is a

greater chance the system in some form will hold - it is in too many countries'

interests to avoid failure. Then expect a pan-European recovery to begin in the

second half of the decade that will gather strength in the 2020s.



Inside the euro for the last decade, the economic and political debate would

have necessarily moved on. Having won a referendum affirming Britain's future in

Europe, the Blair government would have had to think in European terms about how

to produce, invest, innovate and export. Sure, there would have been problems.

But Britain outside the euro in 2013, with endless spending cuts, the biggest

fall in real wages for a century, 500,000 people relying on food banks, and a

weak unbalanced economy, is hardly a land of milk and honey.



Emboldened by his referendum victory, Blair could have sacked Brown before the

disastrous second phase of his chancellorship and lacklustre prime ministership.

Blairism would have morphed into a new form of European social democracy,

fashioning British-style stakeholder capitalism. UK politics would not have

moved so decisively to the right, with conservatives preaching free-market

Thatcherism while the left clings to a bastard Keynesianism - united only in

their belief, against all the evidence including Britain's export performance,

that floating exchange rates are a universal panacea.



A single currency demands disciplines and painful trade-offs: but floating

exchange rates after a financial crisis are a transmission mechanism for

bank-runs and beggar-my-neighbour devaluations. Magic bullets do not exist. Had

Britain joined, both we and Europe would have been better placed, and Larry

Elliott would now be writing about how better to get Britain to innovate and

invest under a fourth-term Labour government. A better world all round.

Europe: Labour to abstain on referendum bill



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour, political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 19



LENGTH: 234 words





Labour is to abstain on the private member's bill introducing a referendum on

Britain's membership of the European Union by 2017.



The bill sponsored by James Wharton, Tory MP for Stockton South, is due to have

its second reading on 5 July. The Labour decision was denounced as weak by the

Tory chairman, Grant Shapps.



Wharton has said he thinks his bill has a 50-50 chance of getting onto the

statute book, but the Labour abstention will help the bill get through to its

next stage of detailed examination in committee. Labour is divided on its

long-term referendum stance but says it is committed to a plebiscite if there is

a further significant proposed transfer of powers to Brussels. The shadow

chancellor, Ed Balls, has warned Labour not to end up as the anti-referendum

party. Only 15 or so Labour MPs openly support an in-out referendum.



David Cameron has said he wants a referendum to be held after negotiating a

potential new relationship with the EU. He has told Conservative MPs to attend

the vote on 5 July, even though it is a private member's bill.



The Tories accused Labour of denying voters a say over whether Britain should

quit the EU. Shapps said: "We want to allow the British people to decide our

European future with an in-out referendum and we want to turn this commitment

into law. Ed Miliband has made clear yet again that he is too weak to give his

MPs, let alone the public, a say."

Defiant Erdogan says he will hit back at protests: PM's warning raises fears of

showdown in Istanbul Gezi Park activists told 'the issue will end in 24 hours'



BYLINE: Constanze Letsch in Istanbul and Ian Traynor in Brussels



SECTION: GUARDIAN INTERNATIONAL PAGES; Pg. 22



LENGTH: 503 words





Turkey's prime minister defied a growing wave of international criticism

yesterday and issued a chilling warning to the protesters who have captured

central Istanbul for a fortnight, declaring that the demonstrations against his

rule would be over within 24 hours.



Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ultimatum, which he said was conveyed to his police chief

and interior minister, ratcheted up the tension in Turkey after a relatively

calm day following the mass teargas attacks by riot police in Istanbul city

centre on Tuesday evening.



"We have not responded to punches with punches. From now on security forces will

respond differently," Erdogan said after meeting a team said to be representing

the protesters for the first time. "This issue will be over in 24 hours."



The sense of a looming denouement at Gezi Park off Taksim Square in central

Istanbul was reinforced when a deputy leader of Erdogan's ruling Justice and

Development party (AKP) said the park had to be cleared of demonstrators as soon

as possible.



Thousands of protesters again gathered at the park yesterday, with phalanxes of

riot police marshalling nearby.



The ruling party's deputy chairman and government Huseyin Celik added that a

city-wide referendum could be held on the initial issue that sparked the wave of

national protest - whether the park should be demolished to make way for a

shopping mall and a replica of an old military barracks.



The belligerent statement, contrasting with more conciliatory language from

President Abdullah Gul.



The sense of a final showdown was reinforced by Istanbul's governor, Huseyin

Avni Mutlu, who ordered the protesters to clear the park for their own "safety".



"Families should take their children out of there," he warned.



Protest leaders in the park, however, pledged to stay put as around 1,000

lawyers also took to the streets to complain about the detention of 45 of their

colleagues on Tuesday.



The umbrella group behind the protest uniting dozens of trade and professional

associations, Taksim Solidarity, denounced the talks with the prime minister in

Ankara as illegitimate.



"No meeting, while the police violence disregarding right to life so

relentlessly continues in and around the Gezi Park, will produce results," it

said. "We are waiting for you in Gezi Park. We are here and we are not leaving."



In the strongest criticism yet of Erdogan's hard line, the European Union

contradicted the prime minister and voiced support for the protesters, saying

they had been largely peaceful and subject to indiscriminate violence from riot

police. It demanded an investigation of the extreme reaction, and called on

Erdogan to cancel rallies of his Justice and Development party (AKP) scheduled

for the weekend.



"There is a real polarisation of opinion. Major AKP rallies this weekend would

risk adding to the tension," said Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign policy

chief.



Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, added: "We expect Prime Minister

Erdogan to de-escalate the situation and to seek a peaceful dialogue."

golden stars. Nicknamed Milda, she stands at the top of the Freedom Monument,

symbolising the Baltic country's hard-won liberty and independence.



From next January Milda will become a more familiar face across Europe when her

likeness is stamped on to euros 1 and euros 2 coins to mark Latvia becoming the

18th member of a single currency zone which may, or may not, be emerging from a

three-year period of fighting for its life.



For Greece or Portugal, the euro may have seemed like a prison in recent years.

But for Latvia, or at least for its government and elite, the maiden-faced

currency will symbolise freedom and independence, reinforcing the vulnerable

small country's integration in the west and another big step in liberating

itself from its historical tormentor, Russia.



The European commission and the European Central Bank (ECB), in their

"convergence reports" last week, gave a green light to Latvia to join in

January. EU finance ministers are expected to rubber-stamp that decision next

month. This week the ratings agency Standard & Poor's responded by raising its

rating on the country's debt from BBB to BBB+, which is three levels above junk.



Estonia adopted the euro 30 months ago. Lithuania intends to follow suit in

2015. While a year or two ago the smart money was on the eurozone shrinking to

15, within a couple of years the likelihood is a membership of 19, plus a

campaign gearing up in Poland to take the club to 20.



For Valdis Dombrovskis, Latvia's prime minister, joining the euro makes economic

sense. It will bring budget savings, promote foreign direct investment and

underpin the recovery from an economic collapse in 2008-9 that foreshadowed

calamities to come elsewhere, especially in Ireland and Spain. But it's not all

finance and economics. For the Baltic states, long at the mercy of an imperial

Russia, whether tsarist or communist, and perennially wary of Vladimir Putin,

the euro is also political.



Dombrovskis agrees with Olli Rehn, the economics commissioner in Brussels who

when giving the green light stressed that Latvia would gain rather than forfeit

sovereignty by having a seat at the ECB and in the meetings of eurozone finance

ministers.



It might be an argument that would fall flat in Athens or Lisbon, but Latvia's

national currency, the lats, has been pegged to the euro for eight years -

meaning monetary policy has been effectively set in Frankfurt without Riga

having any say.



Nonetheless, opinion polls consistently show a majority against joining the

euro. Dombrovskis brushes aside opposition calls for a referendum, arguing that

the voters made their choice clear for Latvia's entering the EU in 2004 and the

entry terms included a commitment to joining the currency when the time was

right and criteria were met.



There is no doubt Latvia passes muster; indeed the economic data puts most

current eurozone countries to shame, Germany included. At just over 40% of gross

domestic product (GDP), the national debt is well below the eurozone's 60%

ceiling, while the budget deficit is a mere 1.2%, comfortably within the 3% rule

that in any case these days is honoured mainly in the breach.



Riga initially wanted to join in 2008 but was floored by the financial collapse

in the EU. The country of 2 million was the first in the EU to seek a bailout -

from Brussels and the International Monetary Fund - of euros 7.5bn (£6.4bn) when

a housing and consumption bubble, fuelled by cheap credit from the Swedish and

Danish banks that dominate the Baltic banking sector, burst and sent the economy

into a tailspin.



In 2008-9 the economy shrank by 25%, civil service jobs were slashed, wages cut,

social, education, and health services axed. Unemployment quadrupled; property

prices collapsed by up to 70%; an estimated 10% of the population, mainly young

people, emigrated.



In five years Latvia has been from boom to bust and, relatively speaking, back

to boom. The third poorest country in the EU, it is also the fastest growing,

notching up 5% growth last year.



Dombrovskis argues that the recovery is solid and sustainable, based on

manufacturing and exports and not the easy credit of the boom years of the last

decade. The European commission and the ECB appear to agree, but the latter in

particular is worried about Latvia being a potential money-laundering Trojan

horse within the eurozone. It points to the high level of foreign deposits in

Latvian banks, euros 10bn - half of their total deposits and worth 40% of GDP.



The deposits are overwhelmingly Russian, as Latvia is also a playground for

oligarchs and underworld figures who feel at home in a country where one in four

are ethnic Russians. The US state department has warned of "a systemic

money-laundering risk".



Similar concerns about Russian money played a large part in the recent Cyprus

disaster, but the scale of the problem is quite different. Bank deposits in

Cyprus amounted to eight times the country's GDP; in Latvia the equivalent

figure is 1.5.



Latvia's recovery from a collapse as steep as Greece's and its current status as

the EU's fastest growing economy has spurred talk that it is the model to follow

for stricken eurozone countries. But it seems very specific and very different

from the likes of Greece. Despite the savage austerity, the increase in poverty

and the collapse in living standards, there has been no social unrest.



Dombrovskis has achieved something no other eurozone leader has managed to pull

off, whether on the creditor or on the bailed-out side. He inflicted austerity

measures and spending cuts as tough as any in the eurozone without being forced

to do so by a "troika" of anonymous eurocrats and won re-election.

Analysis: What if Britain had joined the euro in 2003?



BYLINE: Larry Elliott



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 23



LENGTH: 1070 words





Ten years ago this week, it was euro crunch time for Britain. Gordon Brown had

promised an assessment of whether the UK met his five tests for entry into the

single currency within two years of the 2001 election. He met the deadline

almost to the day.



The conclusion was never really in doubt. As chancellor he did not think the UK

should join the single currency and the Treasury analysis provided him with

strong arguments to fend off the much more enthusiastic Tony Blair.



Four of the five tests, including the two most important ones, involving

sustainable convergence and economic flexibility to withstand shocks, were

failed. And that was that.



Pro-euro cabinet members, such as Charles Clarke and Patricia Hewitt, grumbled

that the decision had been a Treasury stitchup. But Brown's position was

unassailable. Euro membership was off the agenda for the foreseeable future.



A jolly good thing too, of course. The euro has proved to be exactly the

job-destroying, recession-creating, undemocratic monster the doubters always

warned it would be. This was not the received wisdom on the left at the time,

when to suggest that the euro would be supercharged monetarism, Thatcherism with

knobs on, was deemed unseemly.



People who liked the euro were civilised, supported the arts, went to Tuscany

for their holidays. People who didn't like the euro drove white vans decorated

with the flag of St George.



Today, it is hard to find even the most fervent euro enthusiasts in the Liberal

Democrat party arguing for UK membership of the single currency. Disillusionment

with what was once called "The Project" is almost total in the face of grinding

austerity, a double-dip recession that has already lasted 18 months, and a

jobless rate of 12.2% and rising.



Imagine for a moment that Blair, Nick Clegg and Ken Clarke had triumphed back in

2003. Let's do one of Niall Ferguson's virtual history exercises and think

through what would have happened had Brown been overruled and UK entry into the

single currency fixed for 2005.



Stage one would have been the transition from the pound to the euro. The most

important part of this process, to fix the right level for the pound to join at,

would have proved quite a test for the new chancellor - say, Charles Clarke.



Sterling had been overvalued in the early 2000s, and hot money flowed into

London attracted by relative high interest rates and a prolonged period of

strong growth. The UK government now fears that joining the euro at the wrong

rate will penalise British manufacturers, while those already in the single

currency are concerned that too cheap a rate for sterling entry will hand an

added competitive advantage to the UK's financial services sector.



Despite attempts by the new governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, to

drive down the level of the pound, when the time came for the euro to be adopted

it was clear the exchange rate was too high. That, said Britain's single

currency partners, was the penalty paid for failing to join from the outset.



Stage two of the process was the bubble phase. Having ceded the right to conduct

its own monetary policy, the UK had to accept the interest rate the European

Central Bank set for the eurozone as a whole.



As one of the bigger members of the club, Britain carried weight at the

discussions in Frankfurt. But monetary policy proved to be far too loose for a

country already in the early stages of a housing boom and with a balance of

trade deteriorating year by year.



As in Spain and Ireland, a spectacular bubble developed in the housing market,

fuelled by excessively low lending rates, an "anything goes" mentality among

lenders and lax regulation. (Even outside the euro the UK had a boom in the

housing market in the mid-2000s. Inside, it would have been like the wild west.)



When the crash did come in 2007 it was a spectacular one. The financial markets

imploded, banks stopped lending and cheap credit dried up. The housing market

collapsed, unemployment rose, tax receipts shrivelled and the government's

budget deficit went through the roof.



Speculation that it might quit, as it did the European exchange rate mechanism

in 1992, meant investors demanded a high premium for holding UK government debt.

Benchmark bond yields rose, first to 5%, then to 6%. When they hit 7%, Blair had

no choice but to ask for help from the troika - the International Monetary Fund,

the ECB and the EU.



Severe conditions were attached to the loan, including welfare and pensions

cuts, and wage cuts across the public sector. Deprived of the safety valve of

currency depreciation, Britain, had no choice but do what Spain, Greece, Ireland

and Portugal did and drive down domestic costs to make the economy more

competitive. But there was no deep attachment in Britain to Europe as a

political identity. Far from it. The buildup to the general election of 2010 was

marked by street protests.



The opposition Conservative party pledged a referendum on whether Britain should

leave the euro, and won by a landslide. The number of Labour MPs fell to under

100, its worst performance since the 1930s. Nigel Farage's UK Independence party

made spectacular gains.



In the referendum after the election the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of

exit. The financial markets responded by selling the bonds of any other eurozone

nation struggling to cope with the austerity demanded by the European commission

and ECB; pretty much every country apart from a hard core including Germany,

Austria and Finland.



The market turbulence caused by Britain's exit proved terminal for the euro.

Bond yields rose sharply across the single currency with investors realising

they had underpriced the risks of leaving the club. Outside the euro, life was

no bed of roses for the UK, but after a deep recession economic recovery begins.



That, in short, is what would have happened had Blair won and Brown lost in

2003. The boom would have been bigger, so too the bust. Britain would have

destroyed the euro on departure, and would be about to quit the EU altogether.

The idea that Farage might be next prime minister would be quite credible.



Euro vision: An alternative decade:



Gordon Brown replaced as chancellor by pro-euro Charles Clarke in 2003: The 2007

crash forces Britain to seek help from the IMF, ECB and EU troika: UK has to

impose even harsher public sector cuts, leading to massive unrest: Nigel Farage

is contender for PM as euro folds and UK heads for EU exit

Comment: Why Greek Cypriots need to get serious about peace: With severe

recession and the discovery of gas reserves, deadlock with the north is becoming

far less convenient



BYLINE: Jonathan Steele



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 26



LENGTH: 878 words





The presidents of the two entities on the divided island of Cyprus sat down with

their wives last week for an unusual dinner. Held in the buffer zone that

separates the Turkish-run statelet from the Greek Cypriots who control most of

the island, it was hosted by the United Nations in a brave attempt to renew

negotiations on ending one of the world's longest "frozen conflicts".



The catastrophic financial bailout and the row over the European Union-IMF plan

to sequester a chunk of depositors' cash have dominated recent news from Cyprus,

or at least from the 60% of the island that is in the eurozone. But the legacy

from a Greek Cypriot coup attempt in 1974 and the invasion and occupation by

Turkish troops is still the country's biggest problem.



No peace proposals were on the table at last week's dinner, which the Greek

Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, insisted should be purely a social event.

Elected in February, Anastasiades claims he needs more time to prepare for

negotiations, but he reluctantly agreed to meet Dervis Eroglu, the head of the

self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, in a getting-to-know-you

session - spouses also welcome - provided no politics disturbed the occasion.



Why he is so hesitant is obscure. The argument that his community's economic

crisis is so complex that time does not permit him to concentrate on peace talks

does not hold much water. The issues have been thrashed out at inordinate length

over the years by a series of UN mediators, the latest of these being Alexander

Downer, a former foreign minister of Australia.



The best chance of success came in 2004 when the then UN secretary general Kofi

Annan produced a plan for a federation of the two parts of the island that was

put to a referendum. Nearly two-thirds of Turks supported it but, to the

surprise of almost everyone on the island as well as of diplomats, less than a

quarter of the Greeks did.



One irony of the buffer zone soiree was that Eroglu was in the minority of Turks

in 2004 who campaigned for a "no" vote but now seems eager for a settlement,

while Anastasiades was brave enough to campaign for a "yes" vote. Today,

however, Anastasiades refuses to say whether he supports the Annan plan, even as

a basis for further negotiations. Indeed his party recently backed new

pin-pricks against the Turkish side when parliament passed a bill that would

deny free medical treatment to Turkish Cypriots who come over to the south for

complex operations that are not available in the less developed north.



The sums of money saved are piffling, and the move ran against the spirit of the

opening of inter-communal borders that began in 2003 and has alleviated some of

the pain of division for the last decade.



Anastasiades has sent his foreign minister to London and other western capitals

in recent weeks to explain the case for delay in starting new peace talks, while

the Turkish Cypriots have sent their chief negotiator around a similar circuit

arguing the opposite.



The US, which plays the major role, seem to favour urgency. "I would hope that

rather than preventing people from moving forward, the economic crisis in fact

opens up opportunities," said the US secretary of state, John Kerry, as he stood

beside the Greek Cypriot foreign minister.



Like other outside players, Washington believes a potential new key to peace

lies in the discovery of huge gas reserves off Cyprus's coast. Without agreement

on the island's future and the sharing of revenues between the two communities,

investors will be reluctant to commit funds to develop them. Nor will there be

money to lay the pipeline needed to export the gas. The Turkish Cypriots say a

pipeline to Turkey and thence to Europe is the cheapest and most logical

solution. The Greek Cypriots are toying with a pipeline to Israel.



Whether the gas finds turn out to be a political blessing or a curse is hard to

predict. Cypriot leaders on both sides have exasperated international mediators

for decades, and the prospect of hydrocarbon riches may produce more stupidity

than sense once again.



Anastasiades's behaviour is hardly encouraging. Take his reaction to the 77-page

document that the UN recently sent him, outlining all the "convergences" between

the Turkish and Greek Cypriot positions that mediators had identified during the

four years of talks under Anastasiades's predecessor, Demetris Christofias.

Instead of treating it as useful, Anastasiades accused Downer of trying to

undermine his credibility and threatened to pull out of the dinner.



Anastasiades is in a coalition government and under pressure from other

political parties - but this only tends to strengthen the view, held by many

observers, that the Greek Cypriot elite has become comfortable with the

deadlock. The south was living far better than the north, while having a divided

and occupied island gave Greek Cypriots international standing as victims.



If that is the mood, it is time to think again. Standing clear of the eurozone,

the northern Cyprus economy is growing while the south is doomed to a decade of

recession. At least as much as the discovery of gas, the harsh twist in the

south's euro fortunes ought to spur its leaders to go for peace.

National: US says Britain could lose billions from trade deal if it leaves EU:

White House raises fears over possible Europe exit: Negotiations on historic

partnership within weeks



BYLINE: Julian Borger, Diplomatic editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 658 words





The Obama administration has warned British officials that if the UK leaves

Europe it will exclude itself from a US-EU trade and investment partnership

potentially worth hundreds of billions of pounds a year, and that it is very

unlikely that Washington would make a separate deal with Britain.



The warning comes in the wake of David Cameron's visit to Washington, which was

primarily intended as a joint promotion with Barack Obama of the Transatlantic

Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which the prime minister said could

bring £10bn a year to the UK alone, but which was overshadowed by a cabinet

rebellion back in London.



The threat by ministers to back a UK exit in a referendum on the EU raised

doubts in Washington about whether Britain would still be part of the deal once

it had been negotiated. More immediately, Obama administration officials were

concerned that the uncertainty over Britain's future would further complicate

what is already a hard sell in Congress, threatening a central pledge in the

president's state of the union address in February.



With formal negotiations expected to start within weeks, the state department

already has hundreds of staff working on the partnership. Sources at US-UK

meetings in London last week said American officials had made it clear that it

would take a monumental effort to get TTIP through a suspicious Congress and

that "there would very little appetite" in Washington for doing it all again

with the UK if Britain walked out of Europe.



"Having Britain in the EU . . . is going to strengthen the possibility that we

succeed in a very difficult negotiation, as it involves so many different

interests and having Britain as a key player and pushing for this will be

important," a senior US official said. "We have expressed our views of Britain's

role in the EU and they haven't changed. TTIP negotiations underscore why we

think it's important that it continues."



US officials say that the White House is particularly perplexed because Britain

played a key role in persuading Obama to stake significant political capital on

the ambitious transatlantic partnership. If it is successful it could be the

biggest trade and investment deal in history, encompassing half the world's GDP

and a third of its trade.



On both sides of the Atlantic there is hope that the boost provided by removing

remaining barriers to US-EU trade and investment would help lift the west, and

then the global economy, out of the doldrums.



Writing in the US press this year, the British ambassador to Washington, Sir

Peter Westmacott, said "a bold and comprehensive deal could be worth 1%-2% in

additional GDP on both sides of the Atlantic. Even a 1% bump would translate, at

current GDP levels, into an extra $325bn." He added that the UK shared the Obama

administration's optimism that it could be completed in less than two years.



Addressing the Senate last week, the US under-secretary of state for economic

growth, energy and the environment, Robert Hormats, said the TTIP "is, in many

respects, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape our relationship with

the European Union". Hormats added it "will enhance our ability to build

stronger relationships with emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere around the

world".



Both European and American officials involved in preparatory talks on the

partnership said it was also intended as a bulwark against the economic

challenge of China, aimed at forming a bloc powerful enough to lay down the

rules of international trade and investment.



They pointed to the fact that Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan,

flew to Washington this month specifically to try to persuade Obama to include

his country in negotiations. Officials said this was a reflection of the

gravitational pull the partnership could exert on the rest of the world.

National: Voters back Cameron over EU strategy, poll shows



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour, Political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 8



LENGTH: 494 words





David Cameron's strategy of renegotiating Britain's relationship with the EU is

supported by most voters, with the prime minister seen as the best UK political

leader to conduct the talks, according to a poll conducted for the Open Europe

thinktank.



The poll also shows that only 61% of Ukip voters want Britain to leave the EU.

The responses, compiled by polling company ComRes, suggest Ukip will come top in

next May's European parliamentary elections, but that Cameron is still seen as

the most trusted figure to negotiate a new deal with the EU.



Less than a third (29%) say Cameron would be most likely to succeed in

negotiating a better deal for Britain in Europe, followed by Labour's Ed

Miliband (14%), Ukip's Nigel Farage (12%) and the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg

(4%). Among party leaders' voters, Cameron enjoys by far the greatest confidence

(80%), while only 25% of Lib Dem voters think Clegg is the most likely to

succeed. However, 20% of the British public say that none of the party leaders

listed would be likely to succeed in negotiating a better deal for Britain.



If a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU were held now, the poll

suggests 37% of the electorate would vote to remain in, compared with 41% who

would back an exit. But if there were a significant return of powers to

Westminster followed by a referendum, 47% would vote to stay, while 32% would

vote to leave.



The most favoured option, with 38% support, is a renegotiation to remain an EU

member but outside the eurozone. By contrast one in four (26%) say Britain

should withdraw from the EU completely. Almost two-fifths (18%) would like to

maintain the current relationship, while 6% would prefer closer integration,

with Britain adopting the single currency.



More than half (55%) of the British public believe the priority in any

renegotiation should be an independent UK immigration policy. Other areas of

priority include giving Westminster more powers to block unwanted EU laws (42%),

reducing Britain's contribution to the EU budget (36%) and allowing the UK to

have sole control over criminal justice laws (32%).



Among those British adults certain to vote in the European elections Ukip would

come first (27%) and Labour second (23%). The Conservatives would come third

with 21%. Almost two-fifths (39%) of those who voted Tory in the 2009 European

elections would back Ukip if the poll were held tomorrow - suggesting Cameron

may be doing the right thing in seeking to underline how he would renegotiate

Britain's relationship.



Open Europe's director, Mats Persson, said: "Whilst the Conservatives may be

heading for a perfect storm in the EU elections, their overarching goal of a

renegotiated position for the UK in the EU still enjoys substantial support from

across the political spectrum.



ComRes interviewed 2,003 adults online between 22 and 24 May.

National: Cameron 'under threat' if Tories lose Europe poll



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour, Political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 8



LENGTH: 482 words





A senior Tory has warned that David Cameron's leadership would be at stake if

the Conservative party loses next year's European parliamentary elections,

something most polls, political betting sites and Ukip have said was likely to

happen.



The warning came as the former deputy prime minister John Prescott became the

most senior Labour figure to call on Ed Miliband to back a referendum on Europe

now, ahead of Cameron's planned date of 2017.



The warning that the European elections could prove to be a flashpoint for

Cameron's premiership was made by David Ruffley, a member of the home affairs

select committee and a former Tory whip. He said MPs in marginal seats would be

unsettled if the prime minister had failed to turn around the party's fortunes

at the ballot box next year.



Ruffley told Sky's Murnaghan programme: "I think next May's Euro elections might

put pressure on him to go harder because there is a lot of speculation in and

around Downing Street, so I am led to believe, that Ukip might come first.



"Now if that happens next May there'll be 12 months before the election and some

of our colleagues in marginal seats might get a bit windy. I don't think Ukip

are going to win seats but they could split the Conservative vote if they are

strong and let Labour through in those marginal seats."



Ruffley said the Conservative party would give him time to see if his EU

referendum bill reached the statute book.



A ComRes poll in January put Labour on 35% (up 19 percentage points on its

performance at the 2009 European elections), Ukip on 23% (up six) Conservatives

on 22% (down six) and Liberal Democrats on 8% (down five).



The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, has already promised a political earthquake if

his party tops the poll next year. The regional list electoral system used in

the European elections is suited to Ukip because the party matters more than the

individuals who get elected. Ukip is currently favourite to win.



Prescott intervened in the European debate, writing in the Mirror over the

weekend: "Cameron thought he was shooting Ukip's fox by offering a referendum.

All they want to do is save their seats in 2015. So Labour should call his

bluff. We should continue to put the economy, jobs and the national interest

first.



"That's why Ed Miliband should call for an in-out referendum on Europe. Not to

be held in 2017 but NOW!



"Labour could still continue to argue the need for reforming Europe during the

debate. Like the 1975 referendum, this would be a consultative poll, with

parliament making the final decision. A public vote either way could strengthen

our negotiation position for reform with our European partners.



"I believe during a referendum campaign, after both sides have been put, more

people will decide to stay, just as they did in 1975."

Financial: UK must be more European, Draghi tells City bankers



BYLINE: Rupert Neate



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 45



LENGTH: 428 words





Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has called for the UK to

be "more European" and said the continent's key institutions could face

dissolution if the UK leaves the European Union.



In a speech to bankers in the City of London, Draghi said: "Europe needs a more

European UK as much as the UK needs a more British Europe."



Speaking almost a year after he vowed to do "whatever it takes" to save the

euro, Draghi said he was not about to enter into a domestic policy debate but

wanted to remind financiers of the "depth of interconnection" between the UK and

Europe.



He said European countries should strengthen their ties and flesh out plans made

last June for closer integration, including a banking union.



"With such deep interconnections, the UK and the euro area share a common

interest: the stability in the functioning of our economic system and

particularly our financial markets," he said.



David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's EU role and hold a

referendum on its membership.



Draghi reminded the audience that all major eurozone banks had important

branches in the City, and Britain's banks were leading players in financial

markets across Europe. "More than twice as many euros are traded in the UK's

foreign exchange market (than) in all the countries of the euro area combined

and more than in the US," he said.



He added that the UK accounted for 40% of non-eurozone deposits in eurozone

banks, and the single currency area was the UK's largest export market,

accounting for £200bn of exports last year.



The Italian central banker said he saw "encouraging signs of tangible

improvements" in the UK, and said Ireland, Spain and Portugal had made

impressive improvements in their export performance.



However, he called on Europe's leaders to focus on "securing economic stability

and prosperity for the people of Europe" by forging ahead with deeper

integration.



"After a deep financial and economic crisis, we now see the restart of the

European process, building on the agreement of the June 2012 summit," said

Draghi. "This process ultimately entails some transfer of national sovereignty

in the areas of budget and structural policies."



The answer to the crisis in the eurozone, he added, "has not been less Europe

but more Europe. "We can . . . safely say that our economic and monetary union

is a more stable union today than it was a year ago."



However, he pressed eurozone governments to shape up their economies.



He said banking union was key. A first step in this plan involves the creation

of a single bank supervisor under the ECB.

Comment: In 2015 Clegg may be in the right place at the right time: He's holding

the coalition together. And given the increasingly four-party message from the

polls he may be called on again



BYLINE: Martin Kettle



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 47



LENGTH: 1082 words





Spring came very late this year. Summer, if it comes at all, will likely be even

later. But in terms of political seasons, next year seems to have arrived 12

months before it was expected. The calendar may say we are still in 2013.

Politically, however, we seem suddenly to be deep into 2014, anticipating the

last days of the coalition.



This is all absurdly premature, in spite of the dramas of recent days. Time

travel is a fun idea. But it doesn't happen. When the Conservatives and Liberal

Democrats formed their coalition in 2010, they agreed to a five-year fixed-term

parliament. That five-year span has duly remained a pillar of the coalition

programme. Yesterday both David Cameron and Nick Clegg reiterated their

commitment to it - although in marginally different language, perhaps

significantly.



Back in 2010, to speculate about the means by which governing together in

coalition might eventually elide into competing against one another in the 2015

election was an issue for nerds. New ministers considered it a distant bridge.

An issue for summer 2014, I recall being told.



Now the speculation has resumed, and it goes wider than the nerd community.

Coalition separation has unexpectedly become a live issue in summer 2013 - a

reflection, in part, of tough economic times. But this is "Dad, I'm bored, are

we there yet?" politics. We are witnessing a bad case of the wear and tear that

affects any government, nothing more. Stuff happens.



Cameron and Clegg are not whistling in the wind when they say the coalition will

continue till 2015. They mean it. Contrary to the impression some of their

members like to give, their parties have an interest in it. Remember, absolutely

crucially, that on its central strategic priority of tackling the deficit and

attempting to restore growth amid public sector cuts, the coalition actually

remains united. It is a unity that will have been strengthened by recent

economic indicators and yesterday by the IMF's cautiously supportive verdict.

That is not going to change.



So it's not the economy but the voters - and perhaps the press - who have pushed

separation up the agenda. Even so, this is predominantly a Tory development. A

deep resentment at having to share power with people whom many of them despise,

under a prime minister who, whatever he says in his emails, doesn't seem to take

his own party seriously, has made a significant part of the Conservative party

reckless.



Self-evidently it is Ukip that has been the catalyst, bringing doubts to the

surface and rattling both governing parties far in advance of the general

election. Again, though, it is the Tories who are driving the clamour. The Ukip

surge in the polls - it was at 22% in a Survation poll last weekend - is here to

stay, at least for now. A Ukip victory in May 2014's European parliament

elections is almost taken as read in many Tory quarters.



This only increases the panic factor, pushing many Tories to try to recapture,

as they see it, votes that have haemorrhaged to the right because Cameron is

stuck in the centre with Clegg. That Tory pressure may eventually cause problems

within the Lib Dems, who are anxious not to be dragged further rightwards, thus

allowing Labour to stake a further claim for traditional Lib Dem voters. But so

far there is not much sign of it, whatever the Tory press may claim. Cameron and

Clegg each tried to calm their parties yesterday by asserting that the coalition

will not buckle. In spite of all the pressures, they are almost certainly right.

Unlike the press, with its collective interest in weak government (especially

after Leveson), the parties still have an overriding interest in the success of

the coalition, not its premature failure. The IMF report probably gave useful

international weight to the two leaders' assurances.



Admittedly, two years is a long time in the current mood of politics. And the

coalition has undoubtedly become more difficult to manage than it was in the

first half of its term. The audacity and scale of rebellion among Tories - last

week 116 rebels on Europe, this week 133 against gay marriage - is

unprecedented. James Wharton's EU referendum private member's bill will provide

the next focus - guaranteed to make a mockery of Cameron's attempt to put a lock

on the party's Europe rows in yesterday morning's Today programme interview.



Clegg's speech yesterday, in which he accused Tory MPs of game-playing and

rebuked them for attempting to push the coalition off the centre ground, was not

a speech he would have given in the first half of this parliament. In spirit it

was not the sort of speech he would have wanted to give for at least another

year, either. But it was very significant all the same, for two reasons.



First, it was a firm defence of the coalition government against its enemies on

the Tory benches. In fact it was a much firmer defence of the coalition than

Cameron, stylishly ducking and weaving in his radio interview, would now dare to

make. Cameron may be the more natural communicator, but it was Clegg who sounded

more like a statesman.



Second, and even more interestingly, it was a robust defence of coalition and

centre-ground government in general. The section in which Clegg calmly rehearsed

the reasons why voters should continue to like coalitions and centrist politics

- which have been under almost constant attack since 2010 - was especially

effective. "Neither left nor right but forward" may be pretty vacuous, but it

could be smart politics. The speech was a timely reminder that the Lib Dems are

not dead yet, not least because they continue to lay claim to something

important.



The Tory-Lib Dem coalition has certainly not ended up where it thought it was

heading three years ago. The larger centre-right project of creating a

liberal-conservative alternative to social democracy has been destroyed by

rightwing Tory MPs and by the obsession with leaving Europe.



But the British experiment with coalition has proved more resilient - which is

just as well, in view of the increasingly four-party message from the opinion

polls. That's why Labour, prodded by Andrew Adonis's recent writings and

interviews, is again beginning to face up to the possibility. Whatever your view

of Clegg, he is the one party leader who believes in coalitions as well as

having a self-interest in them. In spite of everything that has happened since

2010, he may well find himself, two years from now, in the right place at the

right time once again.

Comment is free: The people's panel: Does your party think you're a swivel-eyed

loon - or does it listen to you?: Conservatives



BYLINE: Michael Clarke Conservatives, Northampton



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 48



LENGTH: 171 words





My experience as a constituency chairman is that my party is good at seeking

members' views. That is not to say that the view expressed will be reflected in

policy decisions taken, because it will depend on whether those views are in a

majority or minority of those canvassed.



Allegations that the Conservative party is "out of touch" therefore need

qualification. That would imply there is no communication at all. I would assert

that, in the vast majority of policy areas, grassroots opinion is listened to -

and translated into policy. The exception is European policy, and the speed at

which we hold a referendum over whether this country should remain a full member

of the EU. Put this issue in its right context and it is one of maybe a dozen

key areas.



The same-sex marriage furore is, like capital punishment or abortion,

essentially a social rather than a political issue. It is an irritant to many

Conservatives who oppose same-sex marriage, but hardly an issue that will

determine more than a handful of votes in 2015.

Cameron warns party he will stand firm on EU referendum: 'It doesn't matter the

pressure I come under' Prime Minister stands by 'clear, decisive' policy



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt and Patrick Wintour



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 13



LENGTH: 424 words





David Cameron has issued a blunt warning to Conservative Eurosceptics that his

"very clear, very decisive policy" to hold a referendum on Britain's EU

membership by the end of 2017 is not up for renegotiation.



In an attempt to draw a line under a bumpy few weeks in which Eurosceptics

demanded a toughening of his policy and Tory traditionalists criticised him for

pressing ahead with a gay marriage bill, the prime minister said he would stand

firm.



But Cameron, who spoke of his pride in legalising gay marriage, tried to reach

out to the right by saying he would now focus on the "big picture" issues of the

economy rather than social issues.



"Is this the first now of many other issues like that," he asked in an interview

on the Today programme on Radio 4. "No it isn't. The government now is going to

be absolutely focused on the big picture which is fixing our economy, reforming

welfare, making sure there are good schools for our children to go to."



But the prime minister adopted a different tone as he rejected calls from

Eurosceptics to hold a referendum before the planned date of 2017, or even to

hold two votes. David Davis, the former Tory leadership contender, is calling

for an initial "mandate" referendum to give the prime minister authority from

the British people to renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership.



Cameron said: "On 24 January, I set out a very clear, very compelling policy for

the country towards Europe, which is to renegotiate our relationship with

Europe, to make the European Union more open, competitive and flexible, and then

to offer the British people something they haven't had for decades - an in-out

referendum. It's a very clear, very decisive policy.



"Let me say, this policy, it doesn't matter the pressure I come under from

outside the Conservative party, or in Europe, or inside the Conservative party,

this policy isn't going to change. The question isn't going to change. The

number of referenda isn't going to change. The fact is, it's the right policy

for the country."



The prime minister also joined forces with Nick Clegg in vowing that the

coalition would last the full five-year term. He said on Today: "That is

absolutely my intention and has always been. To anyone who doubts what life

there is left in the coalition, I would argue there is more to come - very bold

reforming, and strong government, and that is what we'll be right up until

polling day."

Same-sex marriage: Conservative party: Cameron tells his MPs: 'I would never

work with anyone who sneers at you'



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 739 words





David Cameron moved to repair relations with a bruised Conservative party by

emailing a "personal note" to all members in which he said he would never work

with anyone who "sneered" at activists.



Amid anger in the party at the allegations that a senior member of his inner

circle had referred to activists as "mad swivel-eyed loons", the prime minister

said the party was held together by "a deep and lasting friendship".



Cameron reached out after senior Tories, who were enraged by allegations that

the Tory co-chairman Lord Feldman had made disparaging remarks about Tory

activists, warned of a sea change in the parliamentary party as growing numbers

of MPs decide that the prime minister is becoming a liability. Feldman

strenuously denied the allegations which he described as "completely untrue".



But senior figures indicated that the chairman of the Conservative backbench

1922 committee, Graham Brady, was expected to receive further letters calling

for a confidence vote. Brady, who is understood to have been sent a limited

number in recent months, will have to call a vote if he receives at least 46.



One senior figure said: "This is worse than John Major. There was quite a lot of

sympathy for him because of the Maastricht rebels. He also listened. With

Cameron it feels like this could be terminal - and will be so before the

election."



The prime minister moved to stabilise his position by sending an impassioned

email to party members in which he wrote fondly of his 25 years as a party

member.



The prime minister wrote: "We have been together through good times and bad.

This is more than a working relationship; it is a deep and lasting friendship.

Ours is a companionship underpinned by what we believe. . .Time and again,

Conservative activists like you stand for duty, decency and civic pride."



Cameron addressed criticism of his inner circle. "I am proud to lead this party.

I am proud of what you do. And I would never have around me those who sneered or

thought otherwise. We are a team, from the parish council to the local

association to parliament, and I never forget it . . . To those reading this,

here is my message: there will always be criticism from the sidelines. But we

must remember what this party has always been about: acting in the national

interest."



Feldman fought off an attempt to hold an inquiry into his alleged comments after

he won overwhelming backing at a meeting of the Conservative party board. Brian

Binley, the Tory MP for Northampton South, agreed to withdraw his call for an

inquiry after the leadership agreed to "close the gap between the leadership and

grassroots". Feldman categorically denies making the remarks which were

reported, though not attributed to him, in the Times and the Daily Telegraph on

Saturday.



One MP said it was difficult to see how Cameron could turn around his fortunes

after a series of setbacks, not helped when he appointed two more Etonians to

his inner circle. "What is Cameron going to do? Rescind the Etonian hirings, say

I am not a snob? Of course not. This feels terminal. I can't predict how it will

happen but it feels like we are nearing the end."



Tories say the atmosphere in the parliamentary party has changed over the past

week after a consensus had been formed around Easter that the prime minister was

secure at least until next year's European parliamentary elections, which Ukip

is expected to win. The successful budget and the prime minister's widely

praised handling of the death of Lady Thatcher prompted opponents to back down.



But senior figures are saying Cameron's handling of the EU referendum vote, in

which he conceded that a bill should be passed in this parliament after

initially saying this was unnecessary, had weakened him even in the eyes of

Eurosceptics. The vote on gay marriage, in which Cameron was forced to negotiate

with Labour to protect a bill which is widely despised in the party, did little

to help matters.



One MP said: "People felt that things were moving in the right way. But we keep

mucking up. It is all mucking it up from an elitist perspective.



"Trying to be all things to all men doesn't work. This culture of 'we know

better than you' is unacceptable."



Others talk of "tectonic plates" - the phrase used by John Prescott to signal

the end of the Blair era - shifting. "Certainly the tremors are reverberating,"

one said.

Leading Article: Conservative party: A spiral of irrelevance



BYLINE: Editorial



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 32



LENGTH: 683 words





What, and for whom, does today's - and tomorrow's - Conservative party stand? In

various periods in the past, it has been possible to answer that question with

some clarity. Before 1832, the party stood for the landed interest. After 1867,

it added the flag, the union and the shopkeeper too. In the first half of the

20th century, the Tories were for empire and against socialism. After 1945, they

began an historic compromise with social democracy. After 1979 this was turned

on its head, in a break with the one-nation past. Yet, throughout much of its

history and most of these twists and turns, the party has embodied the Prince of

Salina's dictum in Lampedusa's novel The Leopard - that things must change in

order that things remain the same. But today?



There was a time when David Cameron promised a serious return to the pragmatic

tradition. The years have exposed, sadly in many ways, the shallowness of his

modernisation project. He embraced progressive and open social principles while

leaving much of the narrow old thinking, which had taken the party to three

crushing defeats since 1997, untouched. The Tory party that has turned in on

itself again over Europe, and now over the issue of gay marriage, a principled

happiness-creating reform that is now widely supported, reflects Mr Cameron's

wider failure. It is a party that is pulling against itself, unsure where its

conservatism and its electoral self-interest lie, forgetting that its principal

task in the voters' eyes is to govern the country well.



The enduring narrowness and division are partly Mr Cameron's doing. But they are

in large part Lady Thatcher's poisonous and still not properly recognised

legacy. All this is reflected both in the leadership's reported taunts against

the party's "swivel-eyed loons" and in the grassroots unhappiness over Mr

Cameron's handling of the EU referendum issue, as well as in yesterday's

backward-looking divisions and contortions over gay rights.



All modern political parties face the danger that they can cease to look, feel

and talk like the country they seek to govern. The Tories face this problem in a

particularly dramatic way. Their membership is either disproportionately

elderly, disproportionately obsessive about one or two issues, or both. As a

result, they constantly risk appearing - and being - out of touch with the world

that is inhabited by those whose support they need for re-election. The history

of the past 20 years ought to have taught the Tories, in particular, that they

have to listen to the electorate, not just the people who share their

prejudices, if they are to broaden their appeal and win elections. Mr Cameron

came close, but he is now slipping back into the past. As Lord Ashcroft, who is

nothing if not a true Tory, said yesterday, the party urgently needs to move

beyond Europe and even beyond claiming to be clearing up their predecessors'

mess.



Three years ago, and with the Labour government increasingly discredited, the

case for a new government in this country was a plausible one. The voters

agreed, and chose the Conservatives to provide that new start, but not with

full-hearted confidence, hence the coalition government. The voters' hesitation

has been richly vindicated. In the past few months, the Tories have turned

increasingly inward and obsessive. They have been weakly led by Mr Cameron. They

appear far more interested in the threat from Ukip to their party than in the

issues that face the country.



But they get the response fundamentally wrong, even to that. The appeal of Ukip

is not confined to either Europe or opposition to gay marriage. It is about

rejecting all the existing parties in difficult times. That is why the Tory

reflex to make stands that expose their divisions may actually boost Ukip rather

than deflate it. The events of the past 24 hours over gay marriage are a case in

point. They are a warning of what Lord Ashcroft calls a spiral of irrelevance.

He is right about that danger. If the Tory party does not pull itself together

very soon it will have forfeited any case it might still have had for

re-election.

Politics: Eurosceptics are provisional wing of the Conservative party, says

Mandelson



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 397 words





Tory Eurosceptics are running a "Soprano-style protection racket" in the

Conservative party in which they are threatening to burn down the house unless

David Cameron caves into their demands, Lord Mandelson has claimed.



As the former Tory chancellor Lord Howe warned the prime minister was losing

control of his party over Europe, Mandelson described the Eurosceptics as the

"provisional wing" of the Conservatives.



Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, hit back at Howe. Speaking on The Andrew Marr

Show on BBC1, he said: "I don't think those views actually represent the

reality. The substance is that the Conservative party says if we are going to be

successful in that global race we need to renegotiate that relationship with

Europe and give the British people a say."



But Mandelson echoed Howe's warning, though he used a more dramatic analogy. He

told the Marr Show: "We all know what's going on inside the Conservative party.

The UK Isolation party and their fellow travellers in the Conservatives are sort

of operating a Soprano-style protection racket inside the Conservative party.

They are saying: 'Do what we want, give us what we are demanding, or we are

going to burn your home down.'"



The former Northern Ireland secretary even appeared to liken the Eurosceptics to

the provisional wing of the Irish republican movement. He said: "Just because

one wing - the provisional wing - of the Conservative party want to bring down

their leader and change their party's policy and are using this as an issue to

do so is not a good reason to hold a referendum."



Mandelson endorsed Ed Miliband's position on an EU referendum. "On this issue

they are right. They are saying yes to a referendum if there is some significant

change in the relationship. But no, not an in-out referendum just for the sake

of having a referendum."



Hunt's and Mandelson's interventions came after Howe lambasted Cameron over

Europe.



He wrote in the Observer: "Sadly, by making it clear in January that he opposes

the current terms of UK membership of the EU, the prime minister has opened a

Pandora's box politically and seems to be losing control of his party in the

process.



"The ratchet-effect of Euroscepticism has now gone so far that the Conservative

leadership is in effect running scared of its own backbenchers, let alone Ukip,

having allowed deep anti-Europeanism to infect the very soul of the party."

Politics: Feldman to face challenge over 'swivel-eyed' slur: Conservative

co-chairman denies insulting activists Hunt in fightback as party board demands

answers



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 868 words





Lord Feldman, the Conservative co-chairman, is to be challenged at a meeting of

the party board today over allegations that he made disparaging remarks about

Tory grassroots activists.



As the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, led a cabinet fightback on behalf of

Feldman, who denies having described activists as "mad, swivel-eyed loons", a

member of the Tory party board said he would be asking Feldman to explain

himself.



Brian Binley, the Conservative MP for Northampton South who has been an officer

of the party for 54 years, said: "This is a very disturbing matter and needs a

full and proper review at the party board meeting. From that meeting I will

decide how I will act thereafter."



The involvement of the board, which represents the views of Tory activists, will

dismay Downing Street after it spent the weekend rubbishing reports in the Times

and Daily Telegraph about Feldman's alleged comments. Feldman described the

reports as "completely untrue".



No 10 was particularly sensitive because the alleged remarks revived criticism

of the Tory leadership for being aloof and out of touch. Hunt spoke for Downing

Street when he told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: "The person who is alleged to

have said that has denied it and I know the individual and I trust him. "



The unease across the party was highlighted yesterday when 35 current or former

Conservative associations handed in a letter to Downing Street that accused the

prime minister of showing "utter contempt" for the grassroots activists after

pressing ahead with legislation for equal marriage.



Ben Harris-Quinney, the chairman of the Bow Group and director of Conservative

Grassroots, which drummed up support for the letter, said of Feldman's alleged

remarks: "It doesn't matter who made these comments, the problem is that it

comes as no surprise and is representative of a wider malaise in the party - the

disconnect between the leadership and the grassroots, between conservatism and

the leadership of the Conservative party. The tail cannot continue to wag the

dog."



The Bow Group, which was founded in 1951, intervened in the wake of Feldman's

alleged remarks on Wednesday night - said to have been made shortly after 116

Tory MPs showed their unease with David Cameron over Europe and voted in favour

of an amendment regretting the absence of an EU referendum in the Queen's

speech.



Taunted by a journalist about the vote, an unnamed senior member of Cameron's

inner circle was quoted by the Times and the Daily Telegraph as saying: "It's

fine. There's really no problem. The MPs just have to do it because the

associations tell them to, and the associations are all mad, swivel-eyed loons."



The alleged remarks were particularly damaging because they appeared to echo the

prime minister's language. The FT reported in March that Cameron "tells

colleagues that anyone who wants to talk to him about the EU is 'swivel-eyed'".

The FT article was not challenged by No 10.



Downing Street said over the weekend that the Times and Telegraph, which

reported the remarks, had no credibility because they had declined to name

Feldman, who admitted talking briefly to journalists at the Intercontinental

Hotel at Westminster.



The Tory co-chair recognised one of the journalists when he popped out of a

private room, where he was attending a dinner hosted by the Conservative Friends

of Pakistan.



The journalist and another colleague, who was attending a dinner in the hotel's

Blue Boar Smokehouse restaurant with the prime minister's former civil service

press secretary Steve Field, had a brief conversation with Feldman about the

vote. Field and two other journalists did not hear the conversation.



Feldman has said he is consulting his lawyers over the publication of the

comments, which he said do not "represent my view of our activists".



Binley said: "I would be hurt and surprised if Andrew Feldman said these things.

But I am in a serious quandary here because I don't believe senior journalists

would say these things if they didn't have the basis of truth.



"That is why it is no good simply saying Andrew Feldman is an honourable man, it

is no good simply saying I'm going to talk to my lawyer about this. I personally

- and the voluntary sector (of the party) - need to know the truth of this

matter."



David Mellor, a former member of John Major's cabinet, said the row highlighted

the need to have a heavyweight figure as Tory chairman. Feldman is co-chairman

along with the MP Grant Shapps. Mellor told the Murnaghan Programme on Sky News:

"I am old enough to remember the days when the Tory party chairman was a serious

political figure and chosen because they were a serious political figure.

Feldman is a great friend of the prime minister.



"He strenuously denies (the remarks). But, if so, I have to say as a former

lawyer - sue them. Where is the writ? I think we will find the writ will not

appear.



"If it was him - as newspapers suggest - then this has been a disaster waiting

to happen because you cannot elevate tennis playing friends to be chairman of

the Conservative party without there being a political price to pay."

Comment: Exit Europe from the left: Most Britons dislike the EU. If trade unions

don't articulate their concerns, the hard right will



BYLINE: Bob Crow



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 43



LENGTH: 617 words





For years the electorate has overwhelmingly opposed Britain's membership of the

European Union - particularly those who work for a living. Yet while movements

in other countries that are critical of the EU are led by the left, in Britain

they are dominated by the hard right, and working-class concerns are largely

ignored.



This is particularly strange when you consider the EU is largely a Tory

neoliberal project. Not only did the Conservative prime minister Edward Heath

take Britain into the common market in 1973, but Margaret Thatcher campaigned to

stay in it in the 1975 referendum, and was one of the architects of the Single

European Act - which gave us the single market, EU militarisation and eventually

the struggling euro. John Major rammed through the Maastricht treaty and

embarked on the disastrous privatisation of our railways using EU directives.



Even now, the majority of David Cameron's Tories will campaign for staying in

the EU if we do get the referendum the electorate so clearly wants. And most of

the left seems to be lining up alongside them. My union stood in the last

European elections under the No2EU-Yes to Democracy coalition, which set out to

give working people a voice and to challenge the politics of the racist British

National party, yet the BNP received far more media coverage. Today it is Ukip

that is enjoying the media spotlight. Its rightwing Thatcherite rhetoric is a

gift to a political establishment that seeks to project a narrow agenda of

continued EU membership.



But the reality is that Ukip supports the EU agenda of privatisation, cuts and

austerity. It opposes the renationalisation of our rail network as much as any

Eurocrat. Yet Ukip has filled the political vacuum created when the Labour party

and parts of the trade union movement adopted the position of EU cheerleaders,

believing in the myth of "social Europe".



Social EU legislation, which supposedly leads to better working conditions, has

not saved one job and is riddled with opt-outs for employers. It is making

zero-hour contracts and agency-working the norm while undermining collective

bargaining and full-time, secure employment. Meanwhile, 10,000 manufacturing

jobs in the East Midlands still hang in the balance because EU law demanded that

the crucial Thameslink contract go to Siemens in Germany rather than Bombardier

in Derby.



Today, unemployment in the eurozone is at a record 12%. In the countries hit

hardest, youth unemployment tops 60% and the millions of personal tragedies of

lost homes, jobs, pensions and services are testament to the sick joke of

"social Europe".



The raft of EU treaties are, as Tony Benn once said, nothing more than a

cast-iron manifesto for capitalism that demands the chaos of the complete free

movement of capital, goods, services and labour. The EU sees the current crisis

as an opportunity to speed up its privatisation drive. Mass unemployment and

economic decline is a price worth paying for structural adjustment in favour of

monopoly capitalism.



In Britain and across the EU, every public service faces privatisation and

fragmentation. Indeed, the clause in the Health and Social Care Act demanding

privatisation of every aspect of our NHS was defended by the Lib Dems on the

basis of EU competition law.



But governments do not have to carry out such EU policies: they could carry out

measures on behalf of those who elect them. That means having democratic control

over capital flows, our borders and the future of our economy for the benefit of

everyone.



The only rational course is to leave the EU so elected governments regain the

democratic power to decide matters on behalf of the people they serve.

National: Senior Tory calls party activists 'mad loons': Cameron aide due to

play key role in election plans: Ukip leader moves to seize political advantage



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt, Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 5



LENGTH: 452 words





Downing Street was wrestling with a dilemma last night over how to respond after

a close ally of David Cameron was alleged to have described Tory activists as

"mad, swivel-eyed loons".



In remarks immediately seized on by Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, the senior

Tory said that the party's MPs have to rebel against the leadership because they

face pressure from hardline associations.



Farage, who knows the identity of the Tory, tweeted: "If you are a Conservative

supporter who believes in Ukip ideas then your party hates you. Come and join

us."



The senior Tory made the remarks - in earshot of journalists - after being asked

about the decision of 116 Tory MPs to defy the prime minister and vote in favour

of an amendment regretting the absence of a EU referendum in the Queen's speech.



The Conservative said: "It's fine. There's really no problem. The MPs just have

to do it because the associations tell them to, and the associations are all

mad, swivel-eyed loons."



Downing Street faced pressure last night because the Tory has been well known to

the prime minister for many years and is due to play a significant role in the

party's preparations for the general election. The Times, Daily Telegraph, the

Daily Mirror, who all reported the remarks and who know the identity of the

Tory, declined to name the senior member of the prime minister's circle.



The publication of the remarks, which were made during the week while the prime

minister was in the US, are particularly embarrassing for Cameron. They come

after No 10 aides expressed fury with Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, who

criticised the government for devoting so much time to the gay marriage

legislation.



Downing Street aides are relaxed about Tory MPs, including ministers, voicing

opposition to gay marriage because it is a free vote. But they felt that the

defence secretary crossed a line when he criticised No 10 for devoting so much

parliamentary time to the issue. This was regarded as a deeply hostile act and

fed suspicions that Hammond is looking to become chancellor in a post- Cameron

government or even to make a play for the Tory leadership.



But No 10 has a more immediate crisis after the name of the Tory who criticised

Tory activists was running in Westminster circles last night. The senior figure

is expected to be named today.



Downing Street, which knows the name of the Tory, declined to comment last

night. But Farage is planning to exploit the embarrassment when the Tory is

named.



The Ukip leader is planning to say: "This person is an excellent recruiting

sergeant for Ukip. If constituency chairman or district chairmen of the local

Conservative associations feel uncomfortable, now is a good time to leave the

party."

Weekend: The battle for Britain: They worship Churchill, Thatcher and the right

to smoke, they hate gay marriage and Europe: is Ukip the lunatic fringe or the

shape of politics to come? John Harris goes east to meet Britain's newest

political tribe. Pictures by David Levene



BYLINE: John Harris



SECTION: GUARDIAN WEEKEND PAGES; Pg. 20



LENGTH: 3713 words





Susan McCaffery lives in Billericay, in Essex. She's 72 and, thanks to the UK

Independence Party, a member of the local town council. It's a hot Wednesday

afternoon and she is talking to me in her sitting room, where there's an organ

in one corner and a few piles of bumf from the Pentecostal church of which she's

an enthusiastic member.



Until 2007, she was also the minutes secretary of Basildon Conservative

Association. "But I was just so unimpressed with their discussions, with the

lack of initiative," she says. "There was no desire to go forward. No vision. In

the end, I thought, I can't stand this any longer.



"People want, in a sense, to revert back to how we were," she says. "You know:

we won the second world war, only we've lost it now, because Germany's taken

over. . . But we had people then, ready to stand up like Churchill and say,

'This is what we're going to do.' A lot of people in this country are saying,

'Where are the leaders? Where are the people prepared to take a stand?' "



As well as the awfulness of modern politicians, immigration, the amount of money

Britain pays into the EU, the alleged failings of multiculturalism, the need

drastically to cut the UK's foreign aid budget and the dazzling brilliance of

the late Margaret Thatcher, Ukip members mention the second world war a lot. But

McCaffery's take on 1939-45 is that bit more interesting. Unprompted, she

explains her support of the theory that Britain eventually saw off the Germans

thanks to the power of prayer. "The soldiers at Dunkirk were able to come back

on a calm sea, whereas the German aircraft couldn't take off from their places

because the weather was so bad. . . There were all sorts of changes that

happened, and part of it was a result of people praying and asking God for

help."



She's sitting on a small sofa. To her right is James Moyies, Ukip's eastern

counties regional chairman, an urbane Scot with a background in Conservative

politics, who's also the director of a "field marketing" firm. On her left is

21-year-old Carl Whitwell, who splits his time between working for a secondhand

electrical goods outlet in Southend and assisting with Ukip's youth wing (his

Twitter feed features the slogan "My only faith is common sense"). Neither looks

very comfortable with the conversation, but McCaffery gamely carries on. Ukip

members, she says, may not all be Christians, but the party has "a Christian

ethos" and a constitution that "goes alongside what the Ten Commandments would

say".



A good example, she says, is the party's opposition to gay marriage. "There's

lots of Christians standing against that because it's not right," she says. "How

can you have two people of the same sex and call them married?" She lets out a

sarcastic guffaw.



Britain, she says, should be a Christian country, like it used to be. Should it

be a country with other faiths as well? "Well, it is, isn't it? But, you see,

other faiths bring with them different. . . spirits. And that's the problem. God

loves all people: he loves Muslims, he loves Hindus, he loves Sikhs and so on.

But it's the spirit that humans are not particularly aware of that causes some

of these extreme Muslims to get bomb equipment" - there's a brief detour into

the recent case of six Islamist fanatics, jailed for plotting an attack on the

English Defence League - "and they send hate messages about the Queen and David

Cameron. That's a different spirit to the spirit that we're used to. Because

it's not a Christian spirit."



Looking ahead, what does she think of Ukip's prospects? Intentionally or not,

she uses biblical language. "Oh, you can't stop it. It's a flood."



Perhaps it is. Less than 48 hours after I leave Billericay, Ukip will win nine

county council seats in Essex and 147 across England. Its national share of the

vote will come in at 23%, only two points behind the Conservatives and nine

ahead of the Lib Dems. The face of the party's leader, Nigel Farage - always

locked in some expression of extreme merriment and usually inches from a pint of

bitter - will once again be staring from all the newspapers. The following week,

the government will emphasise measures in the Queen's speech aimed at tackling

immigrants' access to benefits, medical treatment and housing. And the

Conservative party will be in a state of tortured angst, with at least one MP

proposing a Tory-Ukip pact and dozens of others wondering if they should now

advocate not just one referendum on the EU, but two. For a day or two, in fact,

it will feel a bit as if Farage is getting close to running the country.



Out in the real world, meanwhile, Britain's newest political tribe carries on

growing. Ukip, founded in 1993, currently claims a membership of around 26,000,

and its spokespeople say that around 1,000 new people are joining every month,

many from the Conservative party. As things stand, its key heartland lies in the

east of England, a part of the country that has attracted relatively large

numbers of migrants from eastern Europe. Ukip's home turf stretches from Kent,

through Essex, up to Norfolk and across to Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire; in

the latter county, the party is now the official opposition.



Encouraged not just by local election results, but also by its habitual second

place in recent parliamentary byelections, the party is in ebullient mood,

believing it can top the poll in the European elections of 2014. Even if it is

squeezed at the 2015 general election, it has hopes of getting its first

properly elected MPs. To some, even though its self-authored Google listing

brands it as a "libertarian, non-racist party", it will always give off the

whiff of a kind of rightwing politics that often blurs into the lunatic fringe.

To its supporters and members, though, it represents an exciting revolt against

the metropolitan consensus: not so much a breath of fresh air as a sharp gust of

that very British booze-and-fags smell that once wafted from our pubs.



In the Essex town of Wickford, I meet two more UK activists: Paul Downes (64)

and Nigel Le Gresley (62), who are having a coffee in the local Co-op

supermarket. Until February this year, Downes - a former estate agent - was a

Conservative activist, but he had long felt his loyalty dwindling, thanks partly

to David Cameron and George Osborne's silver-spooned backgrounds. Le Gresley,

whose last job was with BT, says he has voted for the Liberals, Conservatives

and even New Labour, but now thinks the political class has floated into its own

orbit. "You need to have people who've been there, done that and got the

T-shirt," he says. "The lot we've got now haven't been there or done anything.

And they haven't got the T-shirt."



There is talk of "the British way of life". As Downes sees it, "A lot of people

of our generation - the grey pound, sort of thing - really feel, why has our

culture become unimportant?" There is also unease about same-sex marriage. "The

problem is, you're going to put churches in a position where it won't be long

before someone will go to the European court and say they're being discriminated

against," he says. "So it opens up a whole hornet's nest."



The two also talk, at some length, about the EU - once again with the seemingly

obligatory references to Hitler and Churchill. "My father fought in the second

world war, as millions of people from this country did," Downes says. "We fought

to free Europe from tyranny. And we're now in a position where we're almost

being. . . controlled by a communist regime, in my view, where the EU controls

everything."



"It may not necessarily be communist, but it's authoritarian," Le Gresley

offers. "It's no longer non-democratic: it's anti-democratic."



For some of the Ukip tribe, the need for Britain to leave the EU still pushes

all other issues to one side. For others, it takes its place in a mess of

grievances shared by many British people. Some of these issues - immigration,

wind farms, even the smoking ban - are reflected in Ukip policy. Some aren't:

there is an obvious tension between, say, Ukip members' and voters' complaints

about the low end of the job market, and the party's avowed belief in

free-market economics. But for the time being, such tensions come down to

matters of mere nuance: Ukip is now the party for a lot of people who have

simply lost patience with politics and, as such, its supporters can apparently

project on to it anything they like.



Keith Gibbs, 65, joined in 2012. He's an ex-policeman and another disciple of

Margaret Thatcher. "She looked after the armed forces and the police, and I'm

all for that," he tells me, nursing a lunchtime pint in a pub garden in nearby

Rayleigh. "I mean, we're becoming a third world country really, the way we're

going."



How? "Our military's going down and down, and you're going to get to a stage

where we won't be able to defend ourselves."



Throughout this conversation, Whitwell from Ukip's youth wing maintains a

slightly irritating presence, perching on the edge of the table and trying to

put a PR gloss on what Gibbs says. "If that happens," he says, to no one in

particular, "we'll have to rely on the European Union."



We move on to immigration. "There's lots and lots of people coming here, and

they're just coming for the benefits," Gibbs says. "Take something like that

woman who came here: she's got four kids already, she's expecting twins, and

that cost the government - us, taxpayers, the NHS - £200,000, to treat her to

have twins."



"We don't blame the people for doing it," Whitwell says.



"You can't blame them," Gibbs adds. "It's the bloody system."



Once home, I spend time trying to find anything online that corresponds to

Gibbs' tale about the woman with four kids and twins on the way, but find

nothing. The same goes for his claims about what he has seen at a major

public-sector employer in Southend.



"I used to watch people come in, to the pay desk," he says. "Every Friday, they

used to come in, and sign, and get a brown envelope. I had a look one day. There

was a big list, five pages long - people who just used to come in and get paid

money." A pause, for effect. "All immigrants."



Next, I am introduced to 52-year-old Jamie Huntman, a native of Barking who owns

a timber business near Thundersley, a few miles south of Rayleigh. His pride and

joy is a prefab dog-grooming parlour that he has put up on one side of his yard

and handed over to a local woman who now turns a £1,000-a-week profit. Neatly

dressed in a shirt, tie and green-brown slacks, Huntman explains his long fight

over this new venture with Essex county council's planning department, which

seems to have nudged him in Ukip's direction.



As with so many Ukip members, he pines for the days when politicians had tasted

at least a flavour of lives like his. "They go straight from Eton into Oxbridge

and into Westminster," he says. "I've always been of the opinion that you never

judge a man until you walk a mile in his moccasins. But what do they know about

standing in my yard, serving wood or grooming a dog?"



A few days ago, I remind him, the somewhat notorious Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom

appeared on 5 Live, reiterating his previous claim that employers could not be

blamed for not wanting to give jobs to women who might then get pregnant. What

did he make of that?



"He's a very entertaining man. I always watch his clips on YouTube. He makes his

point; he overstates his point sometimes. But the fact is. . . the hardest job a

small business has is finding staff. And remember: if someone comes to us and

then gets pregnant - if they're off work for quite a number of months, it's very

difficult to survive. It's just pounds, shillings and pence, really.



"It's very difficult running a small business," he says. "There was something in

what he said. Maybe the way he said it was. . . Well, who am I to say? He's an

MEP and I'm just a man in Thundersley."



Two days later, Huntman is a little bit more than that. Alongside Keith Gibbs,

Nigel Le Gresley and six others, he is a freshly-elected Ukip county councillor

and the party's deputy leader in Essex, having beaten a sitting Tory called Bill

Dick. When I speak to him on the phone, he sounds amazed. "I've got to admit I

was shocked," he says. "Though not as shocked as the Tory, who seemed to go very

pale. My feet haven't touched the ground." As far as national politics is

concerned, he sounds equally surprised. Ukip, he says, "seems to be steering the

Tory agenda at the moment. They can't say anything without mentioning one of our

policies. It's a force for good, I think."



"It all started in Huntingdonshire," Farage said recently. He was referring to

the miracles worked by his party in the small Fenland town of Ramsey. It's now

the party's key eastern redoubt, as proved by the sign that greets you as you

enter the place: a huge board on a patch of grass that carries two messages:

"Let's put Britain first for once" and "Thank you" - a reference to the

avalanche of votes that came Ukip's way on 2 May. Since 2011, Ukip has run the

town council here, with nine out of 17 councillors - and as things stand, it

remains the only elected authority the party controls.



For the past six years, Ramsey has been the home of Lisa Duffy and her partner

Peter Reeve, who moved here from Manchester and have been Ukip members since

2004. She is the mayor of Ramsey and Ukip's national campaign director. He sits

on the town council, the local district council and Cambridgeshire county

council: on 2 May, he scored 67% of the local vote, the highest share managed by

any Ukip candidate. As well as working full-time for a Ukip MEP, he serves as

Ukip's national nominating officer, the person ultimately responsible for

signing off its candidates for elected office; his mother, Shirley, is one of

Ramsey's Ukip town councillors. Among Duffy and Reeve's six children is Jazmine,

13, who has already spoken at Ukip events: her mother says proudly that she

recently gave Farage six years' notice, suggesting she wanted to be the leader

before she turned 20.



Reeve, 36, is an animated, engaging presence, dressed in a suit, waistcoat and

yellow and purple Ukip tie. He comes from a farming family in Norfolk; he says

his father would always put up Conservative hoardings at election time, until

the fall of Margaret Thatcher. "That hurt my family, absolutely," he says. "They

said they wouldn't help the Tories any more." His basic politics, he explains,

is "libertarian". He goes on: "If you're asking me rather than the party, I

think all taxation is immoral. . . I genuinely believe that if there's a real

need for people to give money, then people will give it if they're not forced

to."



This takes me aback. He really thinks that an entirely voluntary system could

fund, say, schools, hospitals, the police and the roads? "If people needed roads

and there wasn't this comfort blanket of the state providing everything, they'd

be built." What about the NHS? "I'm probably straying too far off policy now.

But people would donate to make sure people were fit and healthy."



I came to Ramsey a couple of months ago and spoke to local people about Ukip's

success: I half-expected to find a boiling hotbed of anger about immigration and

Brussels bureaucrats, but instead found a sleepy, apparently almost apolitical

place, where people's biggest moan was the dire effect a big Tesco has had on

local shops. On the high street named the Great Whyte, where most of the shops

shut at 3pm and human traffic is usually no more than a trickle, people tended

to put the party's rise down to the hard work put in by its activists, and Reeve

in particular.



He is renowned for coming into town every morning and evening to open and shut

the public toilets, which now feature signs displaying his mobile number. Before

Ukip won control of the town council, Duffy says, he would "clear up dog muck,

do litter-picks and clear out the cemetery - if someone had a problem, they

could turn to him". Among his most frequent phone calls, she says, are those

from people who have locked themselves in the loo.



I speak to both Duffy and Reeve outside a local cafe with the worryingly

European name the Rendezvous. Immigration, Duffy agrees, is much more of an

issue up the road in Peterborough, though in Ramsey "it's getting stronger.

There are more people talking about it now than when we moved here. Class sizes

are going up. They're seeing more immigrants come into the town. But it's not on

the same level as, say, Peterborough or Corby. When someone says to me, 'There's

three immigrants in our class' and they're worried that their child might be

kept back because they've got to have extra support to help them speak English,

I'm just like, 'You're actually quite lucky that there's only three.'" Does she

know, say, any Polish people? "One or two. But purely because they're in the

same class as our children."



Duffy - who's 44 and used to be a store manager for TK Maxx - has been in charge

of Ukip's campaigning in all those recent parliamentary byelections, where it

has sounded its customary loud notes about the supposed multitudes soon to

arrive from Romania and Bulgaria. Given that in some places there are real

tensions around immigration, not to mention outbreaks of violence, does she ever

worry that Ukip's campaigning might make things worse?



"I think it's how you put that message across," she says. "It's about talking to

people, showing them what the effects are, how it's having an effect on the

benefits system, on the housing system: talking through real-life situations.

Saying, 'It's not the people - it's the open-door, mass immigration policy the

country has got. That's what's got to change.' "



In Eastleigh, where the campaign Duffy commanded led to Ukip beating the Tories

to second place, its electioneering included one leaflet claiming: "Next year,

the EU will allow 29 million Bulgarians and Romanians to come to the UK." The

number was derived by simply adding together the two countries' populations.

Which is alarmist, to say the least, isn't it?



"It's not a lie," she says.



But the implication is that a lot of those 29 million people will soon arrive.

And that's not going to happen.



"We were very clear in that leaflet that the projected numbers are currently

sitting at around 4 million," she says. "That was based on the research that

Paul Nuttall (MEP and Ukip deputy leader) did when he went over to Romania."



Back at home, I'm reminded that official figures have estimated initial numbers

at around 13,000, though government ministers have expressed doubts about that

number. The famously hardline pressure group Migration Watch reckons that

numbers of new arrivals from both countries will be in the region of 250,000

over five years. Back in Ramsey, I ask the same question again: isn't Ukip

needlessly scaring people?



"It does scare people. But not unnecessarily. It's just being honest."



But 29 million is its headline figure. And if you didn't know any better, you'd

look at that leaflet and think that many people were about to arrive.



"Yeah," Duffy says. "But the whole point is, you grab the attention with the

headline and then hope people will read the article underneath and find out more

about it."



One or two Ukip candidates in the local elections were accused of very rum

doings, and some were dropped. One woman was suspended after online posts were

discovered blaming the second world war on "the Zionist" (she claimed her

account was hacked); another had saluted Russia for banning gay pride marches

and offered the opinion that homosexuality could be kept at bay via vigorous

exercise. Another was alleged to have been pictured giving a Nazi salute, though

the Ukip leadership accepted his claim that he was actually trying to stop his

girlfriend taking a photograph of him "imitating a pot plant".



Given Reeve's job as the national nominating officer, he must have had an

interesting time. "We were expecting a significant amount of risk from fielding

a lot of candidates," he says. "We didn't have the capacity to vet every

candidate at council level. . . We had to take people at face value, and we let

the local branches vet them as much as they had the capacity to do it." The

selection procedures for next year's European elections, he says, are much more

rigorous - and as far as the past histories of members are concerned, the BNP

and the English Defence League are both proscribed organisations.



So how often has he had to throw out people's membership applications? "Oh

jeez," he says. "All the time. There have been some really sad cases of kids, 19

or 20 years old - a couple of years ago, they joined the BNP, and when they went

to a meeting they were all racist nutters, and they left. I've had numerous

conversations with these kids and said, 'Look - as much as we would defend your

right to join a nutty organisation, you will have to take responsibility for

that.' "



At the general election of 2015, Duffy thinks Ukip's share of the vote will be

higher than the Lib Dems'. "Realistically, wouldn't it be nice to get between 10

and 15 MPs elected?" she says. And in terms of the big forces of history, she

knows why she and her comrades put all the effort in. "Why did my grandad go to

war?" she wonders. "What did he fight for?" From there she's off, into familiar

themes: how much money we give to the EU, Britain's foreign aid budget.



From the next table, there comes a sudden movement. The two women sitting at it

are probably old enough to remember the era of Spitfires, rations and prayer

supposedly stilling the Channel; given Ukip's local successes, I'm

half-expecting them to come over and offer Duffy and Reeve their

congratulations. But no: they are trying to enjoy a quiet al fresco fag. "Do you

think you could keep it down a little bit?" one says, suddenly looking angry.

"We can't hear ourselves." *

Comment: Europe: the business case: The referendum issue is a distraction.

Access to and influence over the EU is needed for growth



BYLINE: John Cridland



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 36



LENGTH: 617 words





This week's political demands for a bill to underpin the prime minister's

promise of an EU referendum have been a distraction from securing growth and

jobs, which have to be the UK's top priority. Today, when I speak at the

British-American Business Council, I'll be laying out the case to re-focus on

economic growth - both at home and abroad. And the best way to achieve that is

to keep a firm foothold in European trade at the same time as increasing exports

elsewhere in the world.



Just as the prime minister was trying to do the right thing in Washington -

showing leadership on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership and

highlighting the positive value of the EU - back home, that focus was lost.



The recent tussle presents an inward-looking picture of British politics to the

outside world. For those in business, it feels like a diversion from what we

should be doing in Europe: restoring growth through trade deals; and championing

reforms that we want to make all of Europe more competitive. These issues matter

to the public too because their main concerns are about the economy, jobs and

the cost of living.



The demands for a bill to underpin what the PM had already promised don't

actually move the debate forward. David Cameron had already set out his terms

for a referendum by 2017 on continued membership of a reformed EU. We already

had clarity over the process - if not the outcome.



Business has to make the nuts-and-bolts case for what our relationship with

Europe should look like. Maintaining our influence over, and our access to, the

single market will be central to that. We have to focus on a positive vision of

reform so Europe does less of the things we don't want, and more of the things

we do: boosting competitiveness and resisting bad policies that work against

growth and stability. Let's be clear: being a member of a reformed EU is the

best way to preserve market access.



There are some who say that we could retain access to the single market without

being a member of the EU; that the UK could withdraw and have a relationship

more akin to Norway's or Switzerland's. I'd urge them to really look at the

detail.



Norway's membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) - being outside the EU

but part of the single market - means that it still pays the bills and follows

the rules but has much less influence on EU decision-making than if it had a

seat at the table. As the Norwegian Conservative MP Nikolai Astrup said to my

team during their recent fact-finding mission to Norway: "If the UK wants to run

Europe, it needs to be in Europe. If you want to be run by Europe, feel free to

join us in the EEA."



While this works for Norway's economy, the British would never accept such a

relationship. It removes none of the issues identified as problems by those who

want to leave the EU. And while Switzerland appears to have greater flexibility

to pick and choose the EU regulations it applies, the 120 or so agreements that

govern the EU-Swiss relationship took years to negotiate.



At a time of great economic challenge, could UK businesses struggling at the

margins survive without access to our primary market for an unknown period?

Submitting to rules without the power to influence them is not my idea of

much-touted greater sovereignty.



The debate over our future relationship with Europe is a worthy and valid one,

but we must maintain our perspective. What we need now is economic growth and

jobs across the European continent. That means putting all hands to the pump to

boost our competitiveness in the international arena and getting some major

trade deals signed on the dotted line.

Front: Ministers move to review civil partnerships



BYLINE: Caroline Davies and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 802 words





The government last night moved to derail attempts to extend civil partnerships

to heterosexual couples in a last-ditch attempt to smooth the passage of a bill

that would legalise same-sex marriage.



The coalition was accused of spoiling tactics after it responded to a call for

heterosexual couples to be granted the same rights to enter into civil

partnerships by announcing plans for a review that would be delayed for five

years once the legislation is passed. The review could ultimately mean civil

partnerships are extended to all couples - or scrapped altogether.



David Cameron, who is bracing himself for another bumpy week after the

"rebellion" over an EU referendum, has issued instructions to ministers to avoid

any pitfalls next week.



The government stepped in amid fears that an amendment designed to give straight

couples the right to civil partnerships, planned by Tim Loughton, the former

children's minister, and two other Tory MPs, could disrupt the equal marriage

bill, which is opposed by many Conservatives.



Peter Tatchell criticised No 10's move. The gay rights activist told Gay Star

News: "The government's decision to oppose the legalisation of civil

partnerships for heterosexual couples is hugely disappointing. It is a sad

betrayal of the principle of equality. I hope a majority of MPs will rebel and

next week vote for the parliamentary amendment to open up civil partnerships to

opposite-sex couples."



Loughton is an unlikely political partner of Tatchell because he voted against

the second reading of the equal marriage bill.



A government spokesman said: "Civil partnerships were created for a very

specific reason - to give same-sex couples access to legal rights at a time when

society was not ready to give them access to marriage. Now that the time is

right to extend marriage to same-sex couples, it is also right we should

consider the future of civil partnerships.



"There are strong views on both sides of this debate, and we have listened to

those views. A proper review will allow us to look at the issues in a considered

and thorough way, giving full consideration to implications of any changes."



Earlier this week the culture secretary Maria Miller, resisted calls for civil

partnerships to be extended to heterosexual couples, expressing concern that to

include the issue in the legislation would lead to a significant delay in its

implementation, and could incur considerable costs.



She said: "The equal marriage bill is about extending marriage to same-sex

couples. Questions have been raised about whether we should also extend civil

partnerships to opposite-sex couples. We are therefore offering the house the

opportunity to have a review of this area, rather than legislating now without

the required evidence."



Miller, questioned by the joint human rights committee on Tuesday, appeared

clear that extending civil partnerships was not a preferred option. "We don't

feel there is either a necessity or a requirement to open up civil partnerships

to heterosexuals because there is no deficit there - there is no lack of an

ability to be able to formalise a relationship in a legal way," she said then.

"It is already there for heterosexual couples. It's called marriage."



Asked about people who might not wish to marry because of their beliefs,

including those who saw marriage as oppressive to women and born out of a

patriarchal system, she told the committee she did not see why it would oppress

women any more than men. "Having been married for 23 years, I don't feel

oppressed myself, but I can understand that people will have different views,"

she said.



Miller had acknowledged that the abolition of civil partnerships would

discriminate against same-sex couples who for certain reasons, including

religion, did not wish to marry.



Any review would take place after same-sex marriages have had a chance to become

established. A period of five years is suggested so the effect of extending

marriage to same-sex couples can be assessed and the government can ensure it

has a proper understanding of the implications of various options.



Church of England representatives claimed some amendments tabled to the gay

marriage bill risked opening the door to pagan, humanist and other forms of

marriage. Sir Tony Baldry, representing the church estate commissioners, said

the proposal would completely change the legal basis for marriage in England. He

added that MPs would have to take a view "as to whether having heterosexual

civil partnerships is or is not going to enhance the concept of marriage".



Tatchell said: "David Cameron and Maria Miller should stop delaying and making

excuses. They say their support for gay marriage is based on a commitment to

equality, yet they are refusing to support equal civil partnerships for

heterosexual couples. They're not being consistent."

Michael White's sketch: Chairman Marge and pals do the spadework



BYLINE: Michael White



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 460 words





Critics of parliament complain it is too slow to engage with topical issues.

Nonsense. Barely 12 hours after 114 Tory MPs voted to split their party in a

futile gesture over Europe, the Commons yesterday debated mental health.



No surprise that one of the first MPs to speak was Broxbourne's nice Charles

Walker. In a similar debate last year the Tory outed himself as a "practising

fruitcake". Not on Europe (though he does happen to be a practising

Euro-sceptic), but because he suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

Under stress the MP needs to do things like switch the light off four times.



For many of his Eurosceptic colleagues it is the same with EU referendums: only

four will do. Not for Walker, not yesterday. Like most MPs in the debate, he was

impassioned and persuasive about society's need to end the stigma of mental

illness.



The only unusual thing he did was praise MPs who interrupted his speech. "A

fabulous point" (Anne Begg). "A fine point" (Jason McCartney). "An excellent

point" (Norman Lamb). MPs can be quite kind when they think voters are not

watching.



Hardly anyone mentioned that EU rebellion. Like embarrassed partygoers after an

evening of spouse-swapping beside a home counties pool, they pretended it hadn't

happened.



In any case the day's Euro-drama was off-camera. It emerged that James Wharton,

29, the youngest Tory MP, has won the annual ballot to introduce a bit of

backbench legislation. Only the previous day he had warned his party against

obsessing about Europe. Now he was promising to introduce a bill to make a

referendum in 2017 as compulsory as a bill can when a) it won't be passed and b)

revolting Tories may lose the party the 2015 election.



Back in the real world less excitable MPs were trying to get greedy

multinational corporations to pay their fair share of tax. The PAC was in

session to re-examine Matt Brittin, Google vice-president for sales and

operations. At issue, the slippery distinction between British employees

"promoting" a sale in London and Irish staff (or computers) actually "selling"

it in low-tax Ireland.



Who says women over 50 are no good on telly? PAC chair Margaret Hodge gets

fiercer by the day. Half the size of ex-Olympic oarsman Brittin, but very cross.

Why? Because a stream of Google whistleblowers had been in touch to contradict

what he told the PAC in November about Google's UK salesmen (clue in the title)

not really selling



Would he like to retract anything? Basically no. It is all very technical,

clearly legal and shouldn't be. Dull? Detail? Nigel Farage would have been out

the door heading for his first pint within 10 minutes. But Chairman Marge and

her allies kept digging. "Why don't you call a spade a spade," said one MP.

Steady on, there's VAT due on spades.

Leading Article: A recipe for irrelevance: Britain and Europe



BYLINE: Editorial



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 38



LENGTH: 685 words





From a militant Conservative Eurosceptic viewpoint, it has been a terrific few

days. First, a cascade of serving and former ministers say they want out of the

EU. Second, David Cameron dashes to publish a bill committing the UK to an EU

referendum in 2017. Third, 116 Tory MPs nevertheless vote to regret the absence

of such a bill from the government's programme. Fourth, in the ballot to bring

in a private member's bill this year, one rebel, James Wharton, comes first and

immediately commits himself to pick up the PM's draft bill. Throw in a couple of

extra bonbons - Nick Clegg's admission that it is now a matter of "when, not if"

there is a referendum and the continued talk of Tory-Ukip pacts at local level

in 2015 - and it is clear that things are going the sceptics' way.



Many sceptics can barely contain their excitement. They have got Mr Cameron on

the run; his weakness as a party leader is palpable. Every day the Tory

anti-European cause makes another advance. The anti-European screw on Mr Cameron

seems to be tightening by the day. But there are two very big problems: first,

all this is dangerous for the Tory party; second, it is the wrong course for the

country.



Take, to begin with, Mr Wharton's bill. The bill commits the UK to an in-out EU

referendum in 2017. But the focus on the bill is misplaced; it exaggerates the

notice that voters - including those who are tempted by Ukip - take of what

happens in parliament. It overstates the priority that voters attach to the

European issue rather than the economy, health, education and immigration. So it

provides a platform for Tory divisions and obsessiveness.



Second, the bill is unlikely to become law. A private member's bill has bigger

procedural hurdles to cross than government bills. It can be talked out. It can

more easily be blocked by wrecking amendments. It needs to get through the

Lords. And without Labour and Liberal Democrat agreement - which is unlikely,

even though Labour has its own party management issues on Europe - there isn't

enough Commons support anyway. Mr Wharton and his backers may end up drawing

attention to little except their own political impotence.



Third, the failure of Mr Wharton's bill could have the opposite political effect

to the one its supporters intend. Backers hope that a strong Tory campaign on an

EU referendum will staunch the flow of votes to Ukip. But this may misread the

importance of the EU to Ukip's current appeal, which is based on a range of

other dissatisfactions, too. If so, it may provide a boost to Ukip's protest

vote rather than pricking its bubble.



If that happens, then the whole false logic may repeat itself next year. If Ukip

wins the European elections in May 2014, the Tory panic will be greater than

this year, not smaller. The Wharton bill could be revived - perhaps by the

Tories officially, or by another backbencher. But the Commons arithmetic will

not have changed. And the Eurosceptics may now find themselves erecting a

platform for defeat in 2015, not victory. Ironically, it is far from impossible

that the Lib Dems - most hated of all the Eurosceptics' foes - could be the

ultimate beneficiary of their obsession.



In the end, though, there are two larger reasons why the Wharton bill is

objectionable, not just in tactical terms but on principle. One is that it is an

abuse of parliamentary democracy to try to bind a future parliament. This is

legislation as a political pose, not lawmaking. It is reminiscent of New Labour

at its most bankrupt. It is up to us, the voters, what the 2015 parliament looks

like and what it does; it is not up to this parliament.



The other, even more fundamental point, is that this country should be in, not

out, of the EU. By all means have a referendum, as the law requires, if the

terms of the deal change substantially. But that's simply not on the table right

now. All our parties, including the Tories, would be much better occupied trying

to make Europe work for the voters, instead of endlessly scheming the collapse

of a union that, with all its faults, still remains central to the long-term UK

national interest.

The fuss over the EU referendum suggests that many British people want to be

independent with no interference or control by foreigners (ie "Brussels"). On

the other hand, we seem quite relaxed about letting our key infrastructure and

businesses fall under foreign control, such as the proposed takeover of Severn

Trent by a Kuwaiti-Canadian group (Editorial, 15 May). Many other "British"

things are already foreign-owned: airports, electricity utilities, bus and train

service providers, Rolls-Royce cars, Land Rover, the Mini, Cadbury, etc. So are

we a proudly independent people or are we, in fact, quite content to see the

whole nation sold off as long as the price is right?

Focus on growth, not Europe, CBI chief tells Tories: Comments come as party

shows divisions over bill Cridland rejects possibility of Norwegian-style deal



BYLINE: Larry Elliott, Caroline Davies and Patrick Wintour



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 626 words





The head of Britain's most powerful employers' organisation today issues a blunt

warning about the risks of quitting the European Union after the Conservative

party signalled the beginning of a drawn-out parliamentary battle over plans for

an in-out referendum by 2017.



John Cridland, the director general of the CBI, says the dispute over the timing

of a referendum was a diversion and scoffed at suggestions that Britain could

have an arms-length relationship with the EU similar to Norway's or

Switzerland's.



In a strongly worded article for the Guardian that forms the basis of a speech

later today, Cridland says: "This week's political demands for a bill to

underpin the prime minister's promise of an EU referendum have been a

distraction from securing growth and jobs, which have to be the UK's top

priority."



After coming top of the private member's ballot, the Tory MP James Wharton vowed

to champion the bill that will attempt to mandate the government to hold a

referendum by 2017. Downing Street said Tory MPs would be instructed by their

whips to vote for the bill.



Wharton's bill will receive its first reading in the Commons on 19 June. The

first slot for a private member's bill debate in the Commons is 5 July and

Wharton has said he has already been in discussions with government whips to

take up the bill prepared by his party earlier this week.



The move follows a show of strength by Tory Eurosceptics on Wednesday in a vote

on an amendment on the Queen's speech that regretted the absence of an in-out EU

referendum bill in the legislative programme. Dissenting Conservative MPs

numbered 114, although Cameron's aides insisted the vote was not a blow to his

authority because he had allowed a free vote and was relaxed about the outcome.



The developments have caused consternation in Europe, with the German

chancellor, Angela Merkel, saying she would appeal to Britain to stay in the EU.

Merkel told Germany's WDR television in Berlin that she views the UK as an

"important member of the EU" and will lobby "our British friends to stay in the

bloc".



She said she saw the forthcoming debate in the UK parliament "as being about

procedural questions right now. For my part, I will tell my British friends

again and again that it's good for you and it's good for us (if the UK stays in

the EU)."



Cridland took the unusual step of speaking publicly on an issue that divides the

CBI, saying: "The recent tussle presents an inward-looking picture of British

politics to the outside. For those in the business world, it feels like a

diversion from what we should be doing in Europe which is restoring growth,

through trade deals, and championing the reforms that we want to make all of

Europe more competitive."



He added: "Let's be clear. Being a member of a reformed EU is the best way to

preserve market access."



The CBI leader rejected claims that Britain could leave the EU but keep some of

the benefits of membership. "There are some who say that we could retain access

to the single market without being a member of the EU; that the UK could

withdraw and have a relationship with the EU more akin to Norway's or

Switzerland's. I'd urge them to really look at the detail."



Cridland said Britain would never accept Norway's status as a member of the

European Economic Area but not part of the EU. That meant Norway "still pays the

bills and follows the rules but has much lower influence on EU decision-making

than if it had a seat at the table".



The shadow leader of the house, Angela Eagle, said the Tories had "descended

into chaos on Europe, and the bill was 'entirely spurious' and did not include a

implementation clause or money resolution".



The Liberal Democrats' deputy leader, Simon Hughes, accused the Tories of

"obsessing about Europe".

Eurosceptics' darling

LENGTH: 141 words





By the lucky dip of a ballot, James Wharton, MP for Stockton South, was chosen

to table the Tory party-devised bill to guarantee an in-out referendum by 2017,

and thus became the poster boy of the Tory Eurosceptics.



At 29, Wharton is the youngest Tory MP. When he took his seat in 2010, he had a

majority of just 332 over Labour. A self-proclaimed Eurosceptic, he was one of

53 Tories who voted against the government to call for a cut in the EU budget.

He once questioned whether too much time was spent debating Europe, saying most

people didn't connect with the debate.



Yesterday he was hoping the bill would lay the issue to rest. "What I hope is

that once we have brought this forward and MPs of all political colours will get

a chance to vote on it in parliament, hopefully, it will become legislation, but

we will see," he told The World at One.

Ministers make move to review civil partnerships: Seek to smooth passage of

same-sex marriage bill Gay rights groups say U-turn is 'disappointing'

include the issue in the legislation would lead to a significant delay in its

implementation, and could incur considerable costs.



Miller, questioned by the joint human rights committee on Tuesday, appeared

clear that extending civil partnerships was not a preferred option. "We don't

feel there is either a necessity or a requirement to open up civil partnerships

to heterosexuals because there is no deficit there - there is no lack of an

ability to be able to formalise a relationship in a legal way," she said then.

"It is already there for heterosexual couples. It's called marriage."



Miller had acknowledged that the abolition of civil partnerships would

discriminate against same-sex couples who for certain reasons, including

religion, did not wish to marry.



Any review would take place after same-sex marriages have had a chance to become

established. A period of five years is suggested so the effect of extending

marriage to same-sex couples can be assessed and the government can ensure it

has a proper understanding of the implications of various options.



Church of England representatives claimed some amendments tabled to the gay

marriage bill risked opening the door to pagan, humanist and other forms of

marriage. Sir Tony Baldry, representing the church estate commissioners, said

the proposal would completely change the legal basis for marriage in England. He

added that MPs would have to take a view "as to whether having heterosexual

civil partnerships is or is not going to enhance the concept of marriage".



Tatchell said: "David Cameron and Maria Miller should stop delaying and making

excuses. They say their support for gay marriage is based on a commitment to

equality, yet they are refusing to support equal civil partnerships for

heterosexual couples. They're not being consistent."

Sketch: Chairman Marge and pals do spadework



BYLINE: Michael White



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 20



LENGTH: 465 words





Critics of parliament complain it is too slow to engage with topical issues.

Nonsense. Barely 12 hours after 114 Tory MPs voted to split their party in a

futile gesture over Europe, the Commons yesterday debated mental health.



No surprise that one of the first MPs to speak was Broxbourne's nice Charles

Walker. In a similar debate last year the Tory outed himself as a "practising

fruitcake". Not on Europe (though he does happen to be a practising

Eurosceptic), but because he suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

Under stress the MP needs to do things like switch the light off four times.



For many of his Eurosceptic colleagues it is the same with EU referendums: only

four will do. Not for Walker, not yesterday. Like most MPs in the debate, he was

impassioned and persuasive about society's need to end the stigma of mental

illness.



The only unusual thing he did was praise MPs who interrupted his speech. "A

fabulous point" (Anne Begg). "A fine point" (Jason McCartney). "An excellent

point" (Norman Lamb). MPs can be quite kind when they think voters are not

watching.



Hardly anyone mentioned that EU rebellion. Like embarrassed partygoers after an

evening of spouse-swapping beside a home counties pool, they pretended it hadn't

happened.



In any case the day's Euro-drama was off-camera. It emerged that James Wharton,

at 29 the youngest Tory MP, has won the annual ballot to introduce a bit of

backbench legislation. Only the previous day he had warned his party against

obsessing about Europe when voters worry more about other issues. Now he was

promising to introduce a bill to make a referendum in 2017 as compulsory as a

bill can when a) it won't be passed and b) revolting Tories may lose the party

the 2015 election.



Back in the real world less excitable MPs were trying to get greedy

multinationals to pay their fair share of tax. The PAC was in session to

re-examine Matt Brittin, Google vice-president for sales and operations. At

issue, the slippery distinction between British employees "promoting" a sale in

London and Irish staff (or computers) actually "selling" it in low-tax Ireland.



Who says women over 50 are no good on TV? PAC chair Margaret Hodge gets fiercer

by the day. Half the size of ex-Olympic oarsman Brittin, but very cross. Why?

Because a stream of Google whistleblowers had been in touch to contradict what

he told the PAC in November about Google's UK salesmen (clue in the title) not

really selling. Would he like to retract anything? Basically no. It is all very

technical, clearly legal and shouldn't be. Dull? Detail? Nigel Farage would have

been out the door heading for his first pint within 10 minutes. But Chairman

Marge and her allies kept digging. "Why don't you call a spade a spade?" said

one MP. Steady on, there's VAT due on spades.

Front: Germany tells Britain: EU exit would be a disaster for us all



BYLINE: Ian Traynor in Berlin



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 802 words





The German government has thrown its formidable weight in Europe behind a

campaign to keep Britain in the EU, describing the fallout from a UK exit from

the union as a disaster for all parties and also supporting Washington's

pressure on London to stay in.



Top government figures in Berlin made absolutely clear they saw continued UK

membership of the EU as central to Berlin's priorities in seeking to reverse

European economic decline and to counter protectionist pressures in France and

other Mediterranean countries.



The intervention came as 114 Tory MPs voted to criticise the government for not

including plans for an in-out referendum in the Queen's speech, a greater show

of eurosceptic strength than ministers had anticipated.



The leading politicians in Berlin said they wanted to reopen the Lisbon treaty

to repair the mess left by three years of financial crisis, supplying David

Cameron with an opportunity to try to reset the terms of UK membership before

putting the outcome to a referendum. But Berlin concedes that Paris may be the

biggest problem in getting its way since the weak and unpopular President

Francois Hollande opposes a treaty renegotiation that could open the way to a

referendum in France, too, and bring him down.



The government of German chancellor Angela Merkel appears to see Britain as a

key ally in its aim of shifting the focus of the EU's crisis management from

austerity to embracing structural economic reforms, restoring competitiveness to

European economies and generating growth and jobs, particularly for the young.



Senior figures in Berlin said that Britain was needed unconditionally in the EU

to boost the competitiveness drive and because of its more open and global

outlook compared with other EU countries. They said the Merkel government wanted

to do whatever it could to help Britain in what was described as taking the

right decision and avoiding a disastrous move.



A British exit from the EU would send fateful signals around the world, in the

US and the far east, of an inward-looking Europe mired in fragmentation,

provincialism and bickering.



While Merkel and senior cabinet members such asWolfgang Schauble, the finance

minister, favour renegotiating the Lisbon treaty to push through political and

economic policy shifts in the eurozone, Berlin acknowledges this is a tall order

because of the resistance in many other countries, mainly but not only France.



Cameron argues the single currency crisis has changed the EU, and is

transforming the eurozone into a much more integrated core Europe, changing

Britain's status, and wants the treaty renegotiated to reflect this fundamental

shift. But senior officials in Brussels warn that any moves to substantially

rewrite the Lisbon treaty would trigger a referendum domino effect, with not

only Britain, but Ireland, parts of Scandinavia, perhaps the Netherlands and

then France needing to stage referendums on a new deal.



The leading government figures in Berlin acknowledged that Hollande was

opposed.The treaty changes would inevitably entail transfers of fiscal and

economic policymaking powers to Brussels, something Paris opposes, then possibly

a national vote on the new deal in an increasingly Eurosceptic country,

according to opinion polls. Hollande played a prominent role in the yes campaign

for the French referendum on an EU constitution in 2005 and lost. A repeat of

the failure could cost him his office.



The differences between Berlin and Paris are reinforcing their estrangement,

with no improvement expected until the dust settles after the German elections

in September. Berlin is also worried that France, Italy, and Spain are stuck in

a vicious downward cycle of growing unemployment, austerity, and relative lack

of meaningful reform. Berlin is prepared to give France and Spain an extra two

years to reach budget deficit targets under the euro rulebook, but is insisting

that the two years not be wasted in policy paralysis.



While the Germans are not making explicit linkage between easing the deficit

targets and launching reform programmes, they are also warning that they are

prepared to help struggling countries but only on condition that the time is use

properly to tackle what it identifies as the underlying problems. The issues are

certain to be raised at two EU summits soon, one next week, the other next

month.



While senior government figures are wary of hectoring Paris, there is a sense of

exasperation in Berlin with Paris, that "something has to happen", that the

problems are well-known, but that Hollande is failing to deliver.

Simon Hoggart's sketch: Europe: a guide to the mosh pit



BYLINE: Simon Hoggart



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 504 words





The prime minister was in the US, showing - in Harriet Harman's words - his

leadership qualities by abstaining in the great Euro debate. Remember how

Margaret Thatcher came to believe that abroad was more important than at home?

Didn't do her much good. (Cameron will now miss two more prime minister's

questions, owing to another lavish holiday that starts next week.)



Back at home, the parties were lining up, or rather milling about. We are

supposed to have a confrontational chamber; many Europeans have a semi-circle

designed for all shades of opinion.



Now at Westminster we have a mosh pit, with headbangers dancing, whirling at

random and bashing each other with their elbows. The Tory party is like a rugby

union match in which all 30 players are wearing the same strip. They're not sure

who they are grabbing round the knees, but they're having a lot of fun doing it.



I have tried to work out a handy guide for readers. The Conservative party is in

three groups: firstly, the ones who want us out of Europe tomorrow. Some very

strange people there. If the late Charles Addams designed a political sect, it

would look like this lot, with Peter Bone as the sinister butler.



For example, John Baron, a leader of the moshers, declared yesterday that "we as

a party are more united than ever before on this issue".



Then there are the ones who are vaguely anti-Europe but will make up their minds

when David Cameron gets the changes he demands. These may include abolition of

the Common Agricultural Policy (yeah, right) or possibly the EU postponing its

requirement for straight cucumbers.



And then there are the pro-Europeans, spiritual leader Ken Clarke. David Cameron

might be in either of the two latter groups, but we don't know because he isn't

here to tell us.



Labour. On the whole pro-Europe. Their position is clear: they are in favour of

an in-out referendum, perhaps, and not now, because we don't know what reforms

might come along, but not later either because it would lead to "uncertainty".

In other words, they might be in favour, and they might not. Let's face it; it's

none of our business.



Ukip. They don't have any MPs, but are now the third party in most polls. Their

leader is charismatic piss-artist Nigel Farage, who wants an inn-out referendum.

Or any kind of pub. Rarely has anyone with so little power wielded so much

influence.



The Lib Dems. Now regarded as an annoying irrelevance, as demonstrated when

their leader Nick Clegg had to take prime minister's questions yesterday. He

could barely make himself heard against a barrage of booing and jeering from the

Labour benches, and sneering from the Tories sitting behind him.



He used to want an in-out referendum, until he joined in coalition with Cameron,

who does want an in-out referendum, so he changed his mind. Tory mosher Edward

Leigh mentioned the Lib-Dem manifesto calling for said in-out referendum with

the Cleggster on the cover. "Was he an imposter, or just a hypocrite?"



I hope I have cleared that all up. I am off to lie down in a dark room.

More than 100 Tory MPs snub Cameron in referendum vote: Backbenchers put on

their biggest show of strength PM's aides maintain result not a blow to his

authority



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 630 words





Tory Eurosceptics put on their biggest show of strength last night, rejecting

pleas to show trust in the prime minister, when 114 Conservative MPs voted to

regret the absence of an in-out referendum bill in the Queen's speech.



David Cameron's aides insisted the vote was not a blow to his authority, as he

had given his backbenchers a free vote, but Cameron loyalists had pleaded with

backbenchers to relent and trust the prime minister after he tried to placate

them by rushing out a draft Conservative referendum bill.



Cameron has spent much of a three-day visit to the US battling to douse the

Eurosceptic fires caused by the rise of Ukip.



Before the vote, he maintained that he was extremely relaxed about how

backbenchers voted and said nothing should be read into the outcome. But the

previous largest Conservative show of sceptic strength had been in October 2011,

when 81 MPs voted for a referendum.



Tory whips said they had not put any pressure on backbenchers, but many senior

figures had taken to the airwaves urging restraint and trust in Cameron.



John Barron, the leader of the Tory dissidents said: "We are going to keep at

this. There is deep distrust out there. Legislation is more realistic than a

manifesto promise."



The vote calling for regret over the Queen's speech was defeated by 277 to 130,

including 11 Labour MPs and one Liberal Democrat.



Douglas Carswell, a leading sceptic, said the Tories would now unite behind a

private members' bill offering a referendum, adding that it could become law.



The result of a ballot for private member's bills will be announced today.

Probably only the top seven MPs in the ballot have a chance of their bill being

debated and becoming law, but William Hague, the foreign secretary, promised

full Conservative support for the bill at a tough meeting of the backbench 22

committee.



Carswell said: "We have to realise we are no longer engaged in trench warfare,

and fight a new much more mobile and flexible campaign. The Tory party has to

realise that Cameron is no longer the roadblock to a referendum, that it is Nick

Clegg, and even he is already beginning to shift under pressure."



Carswell was referring to an earlier admission by the deputy prime minister

yesterday that it was a matter of "when, rather than if", a referendum would be

held. At prime minister's questions, Clegg said: "Just two years ago, an

absolute legal guarantee was given in legislation for the first time ever that

when the (EU) rules change, there will be a referendum. I think it is a question

of when, not if, because the rules are bound to change."



It is the most definitive Clegg has been that a referendum will be required

owing to forthcoming EU reforms, and leaves



Ed Miliband the only leader saying that a referendum is not inevitable.



The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, said a commitment to a referendum now would be

a massive gamble and a diversion from the economic crisis.



But Clegg said his party would not let the Conservatives give government time to

a private member's bill. He said: "The Conservative party are perfectly free for

their own reasons to move the goalposts." But he added: "Legislation is already

in place, and the people of Britain have a guarantee about when a referendum

will take place."



The prime minister said his three-pronged approach - reform, renegotiation, and

then a referendum by the end of 2017 - was right for Britain. He contrasted this

with Labour and the Liberal Democrats.



"You have a very clear policy from the Conservatives. The focus should be on the

other parties. Well, what is your position? Are you going to trust the British

people and allow them to have a say? We have a very very clear, popular, right

position that is in the national interest and the other parties have now got to

make their minds up."

Comment: Cameron's Maastricht: Every Tory leader should expect a revolt over

Europe. But this time the anger goes a lot deeper



BYLINE: Melissa Kite



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 28



LENGTH: 733 words





The latest Tory rebellion over Europe is like an iceberg, which is why David

Cameron has had to change course in the face of it and promise to bring forward

an EU referendum bill. What the prime minister can see - 70 backbenchers

threatening to vote against the Queen's speech - is only a fraction of the

obstacle. Hidden beneath the surface are more substantial opponents and wider

causes of resentment.



Quite why this has turned into a potential shipwreck for the prime minister is

an intriguing question. After all, if you don't have a plan for dealing with

Europe rebellions you really should not be in Cameron's position. The leader of

the Conservatives has to be able to handle an eruption of Euroscepticism as

surely as the All England Club has to decide whether to close the Wimbledon roof

during a shower. It's no good saying, "Who would have thought it, eh, rain in

summer?"



You simply cannot stop the Tories banging on about Europe, and certainly not by

promising a referendum at some point, if a renegotiation of some kind does not

deliver something or other.



No 10 was blindsided by the strategy of tacking this rebellion on to the Queen's

speech, a cleverer move than anything it was expecting. But Cameron ought to

have suspected that the rebel masterminds were far more experienced than the

novice backbenchers putting their heads above the parapet. The suspicion must

surely be that ministers, former ministers, veteran Tories and leadership

contenders are working away behind the scenes. If Gavin Barwell, parliamentary

aide to Michael Gove, is ready to vote against the government on Europe, then

how long would it be before Gove, who has hinted at his sympathy for the rebels,

followed suit?



Cameron should have wondered too why David Davis threw a champagne bash for

Nadine Dorries this week to celebrate her return to the Tory fold after being

suspended for insubordination - and why anyone dared to go.



The reason MPs stick two fingers up in this way is deep anger in the party at

Cameron's leadership, which goes beyond Europe. It is visceral enough to prompt

14 MPs to write secretly to the chairman of the 1922 committee of backbenchers

to demand a leadership vote. To draw parallels with the early 1990s is not

hysterical: John Major faced the crippling Maastricht rebellion during an

economic crisis when he had a wafer-thin majority.



Just as a compromised Major felt cornered by the ministers he called "bastards",

Cameron is being pressured by Gove and Philip Hammond, the defence secretary,

who are trying to take a line on Europe that is too hard for him to cope with.

And more ministers could break cover to call for withdrawal from the EU at any

moment. Cameron should have known: he was a government special adviser during

Maastricht.



Cameron is running out of goodwill among rightwingers, and there wasn't much in

the first place. This is because they too are running out of options. Ukip is

steaming ahead, borne not just (if at all) by disquiet over Europe but - as Lord

Ashcroft's research shows - by concern over economic failures, immigration, law

and order, and a sense that Cameron does not really understand, or even like,

the sort of middle Britons who want tough policies in these areas. Tory MPs in

many parts of the country fear this Ukip surge will take their seats.



The rebels' next move would have been their own referendum legislation. So

Cameron has decided to bring forward draft legislation in a government-backed

private member's bill. Plainly there is not enough support in parliament to pass

it, as things stand. The Lib Dems oppose it, and Ed Miliband has still to say

what his position is. Tory MPs argue, however, that even if the bill fails, an

early effort to pilot it will demonstrate backbone to the electorate.



In truth, most voters are probably not going to vote on the Europe issue, even

though the public currently polls slightly in favour of withdrawal. But Tory MPs

believe that looking determined about a referendum buys trust. They think

Cameron has wobbled too much on too many totemic issues. They need to show they

stand for something.



As for the renegotiation, Cameron says he wants a looser relationship based on

trade. But his MPs have a detailed shopping list of powers - on justice,

employment, energy and agriculture - that they want brought back.



And so the next iceberg looms.

Comment: A Tory-led exit would lead to a carnival of reaction: The right has

long set the agenda. Labour should back a referendum and make the progressive

case for change in Europe



BYLINE: Seumas Milne



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 28



LENGTH: 907 words





For a generation now the Tories have shown a heroic instinct for self-immolation

over Europe. Whatever deal or concession is made, it can be relied on not to

last. In January, David Cameron was supposed to have shot Ukip's fox and bought

off his restive backbenchers with the promise of an in-out EU referendum by

2017.



But a fortnight ago the rightwing anti-Brussels populists took a quarter of the

vote in local elections, and now Downing Street is in disarray as Tory cabinet

ministers prepare to abstain on a critical referendum amendment to their

government programme put down by their own backbenchers.



The prime minister has rushed to produce a bill to set the referendum commitment

in legal stone - though it stands no chance of being passed. Cameron even had to

call in support for his negotiate-first-vote-later line from the US president to

shore up his position.



In the end it will be Ed Miliband, however, who digs him out of his latest hole.

Instead of abstaining and sending Cameron to humiliating defeat at the hands of

his own party, Labour MPs have been told to oppose the Tory referendum amendment

- for fear of giving ground to the demand for a popular vote.



The Tory backbenchers, who are out for Cameron's scalp, will be back. As two

former Conservative chancellors have come out in favour of leaving the EU, and

cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Philip Hammond have said they'd vote no if

there were a referendum now, Tory pressure for withdrawal has gone critical.

It's the bandwagon for the small-state, anti-immigrant UK Independence party -

running at 18% and taking lumps out of the Tory vote - that's made the

difference, of course.



A good part of Ukip's bubble is as much a xenophobic expression of powerlessness

and falling living standards as it is of opposition to the EU, which is well

down most voters' priority lists. In a sense, the rise of a rightwing

nationalist party only brings Britain into line with the continental norm and

has coincided this month with a drop in support for EU withdrawal from 51% to

43%.



But public opinion remains overwhelmingly in favour of a referendum. And, as

elsewhere in Europe, the only reason the political elite continues to resist

giving people a vote on such a fundamental and changed constitutional

relationship is because it fears it may not get the right result.



That's clearly an unsustainable anti-democratic nonsense, which will poison the

political water until it's corrected. Unlike in other parts of Europe, where

opposition to the EU or its policies has straddled the political spectrum, in

Britain it has been dominated since the late 80s by the fake patriots of the

Tory right and their cheerleading press. While claiming to champion national and

democratic sovereignty against an unaccountable Europe, they're more than happy

to swallow subordination to the United States and the City of London. So if

Cameron and the Tories are able to monopolise the campaign to change the EU

relationship, it's clear what the negotiation will be all about.



Top of the list will be protection of the financial interests that crashed the

British economy, along with the ditching of some of the things most British

people actually like about the EU, such as working hours and employment

protection, and guaranteed holidays.



Cameron hopes to claim victory with some retrograde opt-outs and thus back a yes

vote. That would be bad enough, but a successful Tory-led campaign to pull out

of the EU would risk unleashing a carnival of reaction, anti-migrant hysteria,

more attacks on social rights, and a further lurch to the right.



What has been almost entirely missing from British public debate has been the

progressive case for fundamental change that has been central to the struggle

over the EU and its treaties in mainland Europe. In the 1975 referendum, the

left case against the then common market was that it was a cold war customs

union against the developing world that would block socialist reforms. But the

modern EU has gone much further, giving a failed neoliberal model of capitalism

the force of treaty, entrenching deregulation and privatisation and enforcing

corporate power over employment rights.



Claims that the single market would boost growth have proved groundless. But the

EU's profoundly undemocratic and dysfunctional structures have been brutally

exposed by the eurozone crisis and the devastation wreaked by Troika-imposed

austerity.



The fallout from that crisis means the EU will in any case have to be

restructured. Given those circumstances and the Tory commitment, it would be

both wrong in principle and politically foolish for Labour not to back a

referendum.



Miliband worries that a referendum would dominate a Labour government's agenda.

But denying the voters a say would make it less likely Labour would be elected

in the first place. The Labour leader has already argued for "comprehensive" EU

reform, including of restrictions on state aid and intervention. In office, he

would need to go a lot further in using the leverage of restructuring to

negotiate change, in alliance with others across Europe. But a progressive

package of demands should also shift the shape of a subsequent referendum.



What would be fatal would be to allow the nationalist right to continue to

dictate the EU agenda and wrap itself in the mantle of democratic legitimacy.

The terms of debate have to change - for the sake of both Britain and Europe.

Conservatives accuse Clegg of hypocrisy on EU referendum: Deputy PM urged to

back Cameron's in/out draft bill Tories attempt to shift focus from internal

strife



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt in New York



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 574 words





The dispute about Europe intensified yesterday as the Conservative party

co-chairman Grant Shapps challenged Nick Clegg to show courage and back a draft

in/out EU referendum bill, accusing the Liberal Democrats of "complete disdain"

for the views of the British people.



Tory officials pointed to what they described as the hypocrisy of Clegg's

abandoned promise in 2010 for a referendum on Europe.



With Clegg standing in for David Cameron at prime minister's questions today,

the deputy prime minister is expecting to be harried by Tory backbenchers

challenging him to support the draft bill.



The Tories are hoping to shift the political pressure away from their own

internal divisions and shift the public focus on to the refusal of Lib Dems and

Labour to make a matching commitment.



Cameron served notice on Tory Eurosceptics that a draft parliamentary bill

published yesterday, paving the way for a referendum on Britain's EU membership

by 2017, is a "red line" that marks his final offer. The bill states that voters

would be asked the question, "Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain

a member of the European Union?"



Announcing he would be prepared to back a private members' bill, the prime

minister - speaking from Boston - denied he was panicked into rushing forward

the measure. "Not at all. If this was a Conservative-only government we would

just get on and legislate.



"But I have always said that anything we can do to strengthen the pledge . . .

we should do." Cameron insisted it was "completely wrong" to suggest that he

changes tack on Europe to appease his party.



A senior Tory source said: "This is our red line. We are not going to give any

more ground. We have got Obama and now this bill. It is like building a dam."



The prime minister said that he was "profoundly relaxed" as he confirmed that he

would abstain in today's Commons vote if he were in London.



Tory whips acknowledge the rushed offer of a draft bill has not bought off as

many Tory sceptics as they had hoped, with as many as 80 Tory MPs pressing ahead

with their plan to back an amendment regretting the absence of a an in/out

referendum bill in the Queen's speech.



Tory sources denied that the brief draft bill, intended to be picked up by a

Tory MP as a private members' bill, has no chance of reaching the statute book.



In a sign of the exasperation of Cameron loyalists, Nicholas Soames complained

of his Eurosceptic colleagues behaving as if they were in a pub argument: "So

thin appears to be the trust that not even the prime minister's word is accepted

by members of his own party."



The sceptics, he added, had insatiable demands. "You concede a yard and

immediately . . . they want more. I think it is a lunatic way of proceeding."



But Cameron opened up a new front when he insisted that he was demonstrating

leadership on Europe and blamed the Lib Dems for blocking a full government

bill. He told Sky News: "When all the dust has settled I think that people will

be able to see that there is one party, the Conservative party, offering that

in/out referendum and two other mainstream parties, the Liberal Democrats and

Labour, who oppose an in/out referendum . . . It is in the national interest to

change Europe and change the relationship with Europe."



A senior Tory source made clear that No 10 will use the draft bill to step up

pressure on Labour and the Lib Dems.

Leading Article: A question of leadership: David Cameron and Europe



BYLINE: Editorial



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 30



LENGTH: 673 words





Once a leader who warned his party to stop "banging on about Europe", David

Cameron is now a laggard - running up the rear of his troops with a Eurosceptic

drum, which he keeps bashing a little too late. The January speech in which he

committed to renegotiation and referendum pretended to seize the initiative. In

truth, it was a nervy reaction to a restive backbench and an already evident

bump in Ukip support. Four months on, he has abjectly failed to deal with

either. Ukip is sitting pretty on 18% in the polls, and the parliamentary party

has entered a condition which one sympathetic observer said yesterday cried out

less for political analysis than for psychiatry.



Every frenzied demand to lock down or bring forward the promised plebiscite is

answered with more panicky political percussion. Days after insisting that

coalition realities precluded pre-election legislation for a post-election

referendum, Mr Cameron belatedly signalled a rethink about whether there was

something he could do in parliament. But if you seek to satisfy obsessives, it

is as well to be certain that you really can give them all they want. Mr Cameron

was instead virtually certain that he could not deliver. For, while his Lib Dem

partners have proposed an in/out referendum in the event of a new EU treaty,

they have no patience with a gratuitous vote. The PM was so resigned to this

that he did not bother raising a referendum bill with Nick Clegg before the

Queen's speech. After Her Majesty was mute on the subject, the malcontents

inevitably started mumbling afresh.



In the vain hope of calming the Conservative mood, Mr Cameron has tirelessly

improvised. In place of the familiar one-, two- or three-line whip, Tory

backbenchers will today experience the "profoundly relaxed" whip, effectively

licensing them to criticise their own government's Queen's speech. Ministers

will meanwhile be shepherded away from the voting lobbies entirely, for fear of

drawing further attention to the cabinet divisions laid bare at the weekend,

when Michael Gove and Philip Hammond let slip that they could happily live with

an immediate EU exit. In another departure, ministerial aides - ordinarily

expected to vote with their bosses - will enjoy a special free pass. Finally, on

Monday night, No 10 signalled the half-hope that a referendum bill, published by

the Conservative party rather than Whitehall, might wend its way to the statute

books after being picked up by some backbencher.



The procedural obstacles are profound, and Mr Cameron's real aim is less

achieving anything concrete than chiding Labour and Lib Dem MPs into voting

against giving the people a say. That is never a popular position to take, and

it is only because of Ed Miliband's steely concern to prevent his potential

premiership becoming as ensnared in Europe as the Cameron administration that

Labour has thus far held its nerve against the in/out vote. The Tory tactics

might appear sharp, but they do not add up to a strategy for the government -

still less the country. Most voters certainly would quite like a referendum, but

not at the price of a divided government, paralysed on things that matter more.



Mr Cameron started the week petitioning Barack Obama for an EU-US trade deal,

something he understandably regards as important - greater trade is one of the

few forms of stimulus compatible with his economic ideology. But there is no UK

trade policy other than that operated through the EU. The US president's gentle

words about the importance of getting the relationship between Britain and the

EU right could not disguise the farce of a prime minister lobbying on behalf of

a club which some of his own ministers openly wish to quit. Exasperation in

Brussels underlines the diplomatic price that Britain will pay. Mr Cameron once

led his party by challenging it, but today he meekly muddles through by

pandering to its obsessions. Weakness rather than argument provoked the change

of course, for the younger Cameron's critique of the Tories' Euro-obsession

remains bang-on.

Your report on the latest spat within the Conservative party over the EU

referendum (Cabinet crisis for Cameron as ministers break ranks over EU, 13 May)

raises an interesting question about what the Tories' real agenda is. Big

business and the City, the latter now largely owned by US investment banks which

view the UK as an important bridgehead into Europe, clearly want to retain

access to the single market - but without the employment, health and safety and

welfare protections negotiated by the labour movement. This suggests that much

of the Tory dissension is disingenuous posturing, designed to negotiate

repatriation of powers in these areas and take the sting out of the Ukip threat,

or represents "Little Englander" attempts to replace control of our economy by

international monopoly capital with that of British monopoly capital.



But this shouldn't obscure the progressive argument for leaving the EU. The EU

stability and growth pact outlaws Keynesian-style reflationary policies.

Competition policy prevents state aid to strategic industries. The EU services

directive forces privatisation of what remains of the public sector. And

European court of justice rulings undermine collective bargaining and wage

levels. Social Europe is a con. The left needs to make the case for an

alternative, progressive future outside the EU - where we have the right to

self-determination, can rebalance the economy away from finance towards

manufacturing and can construct a society on democratic, socialist terms.

*I wonder if Messrs Gove, Hammond et al have considered the possible effects on

the "British" motor industry of a withdrawal from the EU. In France, Renault and

PSA Peugeot Citroen have declining home sales and therefore overcapacity, and

are closing lines and shedding jobs; Citroen's Rennes plant ceased production

earlier this year. Since 1999, Renault has had a 44% share in Nissan and already

assembles its vans in France. According to the Renault CEO, the Renault-Nissan

Alliance is "beginning to bear fruit" and the French press reported a couple of

weeks ago that, from 2016, the Renault plant at Flins, outside Paris, would use

spare capacity to build the next generation of Nissan Micra cars. The current

model is produced in India and the one before that in . . . Sunderland.



The Conservative party plans a referendum on leaving the EU sometime after 2015.

What might strategists at Nissan and the other Japanese carmakers who have their

European operations based in the UK be thinking about that?

*The current political squabble about membership of the EU is being conducted

with far too narrow a focus on economic costs and benefits. The European project

was initiated after the second world war to try to ensure that no more land wars

would devastate our lives and communities. The period since 1945 has seen the

longest interval without military conflict between France and Germany since the

mid-1630s. Given that the UK found itself unable to keep out of most European

land wars between 1635 and 1945, it would be a serious mistake to discount the

consequences of narrow nationalism. Figures on the Guardian website suggest that

EU membership, on average, costs UK citizens about £150 per year, of which about

half comes back into the UK economy. Even if it cost us each £1,000 per year, in

exchange for long-term security in a war-free zone, it would be a bargain.

Exasperation at PM's 'Brussels-bashing'



BYLINE: Ian Traynor in Brussels



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 13



LENGTH: 563 words





David Cameron's clamour to open the EU treaties to get a new deal for Britain in

Europe could trigger a whole stream of risky national votes, senior EU officials

said yesterday amid exasperation with the prime minister's concession to Tory

backbenchers on the referendum bill.



European leaders declined to say anything publicly about the Conservative

party's draft bill on an in-out EU referendum. It is being interpreted in

Brussels as internal Tory party politicking, but privately there is acute and

increasing frustration with Cameron's tactics.



They complained that while in Washington Cameron launched another round of

Brussels-bashing when he was supposed to be promoting the merits of a potential

gamechanging trade pact between the EU and the US.



"It's the frustration, even on things like this when it would be better to talk

up the EU. You would actually have thought this was just a US-UK trade pact,"

said one official.



"It's the kind of stuff where you just feel you're banging your head off the

wall."



Another senior official said: "It's pure political posturing. Pure ideology.

British pragmatism has gone away."



Officials also pointed to the irony of George Osborne being in Brussels on

Tuesday to push strongly for an EU deal to curb tax evasion even while the talk

in his party ranks was about quitting the EU.



The jury is out on whether Cameron will win his fight to get a fiendishly

complicated renegotiation of the Lisbon treaty, with the aim of securing new

British terms of EU membership that would then be put to a referendum in 2017 if

Cameron wins a second term in 2015.



The big political changes being made in the eurozone as a result of the currency

crisis would warrant a renegotiation, Brussels concedes. But there are major

political obstacles in the member states militating against reopening the

treaty.



Even before a vote on a new settlement in Britain, a revised Lisbon treaty would

certainly trigger referendum calls in Ireland or Denmark.



"Then you have the domino effect. What about the Netherlands, Sweden, France.

(President Francois) Hollande's position is key. He needs a referendum like a

hole in the head," said one of the officials.



Opinion polls show a pattern of collapsing support for the EU in France while

Hollande's ratings are at historical lows for a French president. Hollande was

traumatised by France's rejection of an EU constitution in 2005 and would seek

to avoid any such repetition.



"There will be huge pressure for referendums," said one of the senior sources.

"But politicians are unlikely to start on the road to referendums if they think

they will lose them."



There is also exasperation in EU capitals that Cameron has declined, as yet, to

flesh out what kind of changes he wants or which policy areas he hopes to

renegotiate.



The puzzlement extends to British officials and business. A delegation from the

Confederation of British Industry was in Brussels and sounded out the European

commission about what Downing Street wanted because they have not been told.



Similar puzzlement surrounds the battery of EU police, justice, and security

measures that Britain needs to renegotiate, a policy recently severely

criticised by a House of Lords inquiry as damaging the British national

interest.

UN must target poverty, not pay, says PM: Cameron fights move against income

inequality Downing Street sets out 10 goals to be met by 2030



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt in New York



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 13



LENGTH: 878 words





David Cameron is fighting plans to place a commitment to reducing income

inequality in the developing world into a major UN report that will set out a

series of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).



Amid fears that the commitment could create "perverse incentives", and actually

slow down the battle to eradicate extreme poverty, the prime minister said the

UN should focus on "measurable, concrete" goals. These include ending extreme

poverty and hunger by 2030.



On the final leg of his three-day trip to the US, the prime minister arrived in

New York yesterday for the last meetings of the panel that is due to report to

the UN secretary general by the end of the month on the successors to the MDGs.



The trip has inevitably been overshadowed by the furore back at Westminster over

a possible EU referendum.



Cameron stopped off on his way to the UN to appear on a new Routemaster

doubledecker bus with Prince Harry as part of the Great campaign that promotes

British culture and industry around the world.



He then headed to the UN, where members of the high-level panel are facing

strong pressure from aid agencies to place a clear commitment to reduce income

inequality in the report. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, one of

Cameron's co-chairs, has been lobbied strongly to include the plan, which would

commit developed countries to meet targets to reduce income inequality.



Downing Street believes this is a mistaken approach and says the focus should

instead be on agreeing 10 goals, to be achieved by 2030, which it regards as the

"building blocks" to tackle poverty in the developing world. The goals are:

ending extreme poverty, ending hunger, ensuring the provision of safe and

sustainable water supplies, stopping preventable deaths, ensuring a school place

for every girl and boy, empowering girls and women, delivering infrastructure

and energy, boosting jobs, ensuring access to justice and ensuring effective and

open government.



A No 10 source said: "The prime minister wants to keep the focus on measurable

concrete actions that would help you to alleviate poverty and keep the focus on

being something people could judge whether or not we are delivering.



"Obviously we want to be lifting up the world's poorest. But the best way to do

that is to have more specific actions rather than some overarching high level

message. We should not be seeking to create perverse incentives that would bring

people downwards rather than lifting people up."



Downing Street says the prime minister is happy with the way the panel report is

proceeding. But as he arrived in the US, Cameron indicated that he needed to

maintain pressure when he said: "I need to be there in order to nail down some

simple, clear commitments that everyone can get behind as we look to the

successors to the millennium development goals."



Cameron's talks at the White House this week focused in part on the G8 summit he

is to host in Northern Ireland next month.



The prime minister will today announce that Britain is to use its G8 presidency

to agree a new international approach on dementia, which affects 35.6 million

people in the world. The World Health Organisation estimates this will nearly

double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050.



Britain will host a G8 dementia summit in London in September, while Britain and

the US are to work together to improve research into the condition. "Dementia is

a devastating disease - not just for sufferers but for their families and

friends too. And as more people live longer, it is fast becoming one of the

biggest social and healthcare challenges we face," Cameron said.



"Families, communities, health systems and their budgets will increasingly be

strained as the number affected increases and so we need to do all we can to

improve how we research, diagnose and treat the disease. That's why we're using

our G8 to bring together health ministers, clinical researchers and healthcare

companies.



The prime minister's trip to the US has been overshadowed in large part by the

Tory rebellion over Europe back home. Downing Street was irritated when Michael

Gove bolstered Eurosceptics on Sunday, the day of Cameron's departure for the

US, by saying he would vote to leave the EU if a referendum were held now. But

No 10 was delighted when Barack Obama said it would be wrong to leave the EU

before the prime minister has embarked on his renegotiation of Britain's

membership terms. The president told Cameron he was planning to say something on

Europe - if asked - and ran his comments past the prime minister.



Speaking at a reception at the Milk photographic studios, the prime minister

hailed the close economic partnership between Britain and the US, though he

joked that the UK falls behind in one controversial area. Saying that Britain

and the US will be beaten in the "global race" on low wages and other areas and

referring to the shale gas fracking industry in the US, he said: "We are not

going to be able to compete on our mineral resources, although frankly I am

pretty jealous of your fracking success here in the US."

Front: Cameron olive branch on EU as Ukip soars: PM endorses early referendum

bill: Major parties hit in Guardian poll



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt in Washington, Patrick Wintour and Tom Clark



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 853 words





David Cameron is to table his own draft bill introducing an in-out EU referendum

in an attempt to douse the Eurosceptic surge within the Conservative party and

in the face of a doubling of support for Ukip in a new Guardian/ICM poll.



The poll findings, showing Ukip on a record high in an ICM poll of 18%, will

further unsettle backbenchers demanding that Cameron tackle the voters' lack of

trust over Europe and commit to legislation in this parliament for a referendum

in 2017.



The poll shows that support for the three main parties has drained away to Ukip,

with each of them down four points on last month - Labour dropping to 34%, the

Tories 28%, and the Liberal Democrats 11% - as Nigel Farage's party gained nine

points. For all three established parties to be falling back in the polls at the

same time is unprecedented in the 29-year history of the Guardian/ICM series.

The Tories are plumbing depths they have not experienced in more than a decade.



The Conservatives had previously promised to publish an EU referendum bill. But

yesterday on Cameron's visit to Washington, and in an attempt to respond to

growing backbench clamour, Downing Street said that the prime minister was

prepared to offer formal Tory backing for a private member's bill that would

guarantee a referendum.



A draft referendum bill will be published this morning and Number 10 indicated

that the prime minister would try to get it debated in parliament by allowing a

backbencher to table it. A government parliamentary bill cannot be introduced in

the face of Lib Dem opposition. But a private member's bill will often fail for

lack of time as in practice it is relatively easy for a small group of

backbenchers to use parliamentary procedure to talk it out.



A senior Tory spokesman said last night: "The prime minister has said he wants

to explore ways in which he can make sure that (referendum) commitment is

strengthened. So tomorrow the Conservative party will publish a draft bill to

legislate for an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. We will examine all

opportunities to bring this bill before parliament, including as a private

member's bill."



Earlier yesterday Cameron - in danger of looking as weak as John Major at the

height of the Maastricht crisis - took comfort from the broad endorsement of his

European strategy by Barack Obama at a joint White House Press conference.



The US president first described Britain's EU membership as an "expression of

its influence" around the world, but then offered measured praise for the prime

minister's plan to renegotiate Britain's EU membership terms after the next

election. He said: "You probably want to see if you can fix what is broken in a

very important relationship before you break it off - that makes some sense to

me."



But Obama said he would wait to see if the negotiations succeeded before making

a final judgment, and repeatedly stressed the need for the UK to be engaged.



Cameron acted after it became clear that as many as 80 Tory MPs had signed an

amendment, due to be debated tomorrow, regretting the absence of a referendum

bill in the Queen's Speech. In an admission of weakness Tory whips agreed that

parliamentary private secretaries, the lowest rung of the government ladder,

would have a free vote. Ministers have been told they must abstain or vote

against.



The Guardian/ICM poll is remarkable because barring a single month in 2002, the

Conservatives have not dropped below 28% since Tony Blair's long honeymoon in

1997-98.



The Lib Dems have not fallen below today's 11% in the series since September of

1997, the immediate aftermath of Blair's first victory.



Labour's 34% score is its lowest since the immediate aftermath of Gordon Brown's

ejection from power, in July 2010.



The poll also shows that there is a clear "Farage factor" in the personal

leadership ratings. Last month voters were split down the middle on his

performance with 28% saying Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, was doing a good job,

and 29% a bad job, giving a net negative score of -1. Today, the balance of

opinion is running 40%:23% in his favour, a net positive of +17.



Last night Farage described the Conservative proposal as "a sticking plaster to

paste the cracks of a divided party."



A senior Lib Dem source told the Press Association that the party was

"nonplussed" about news of the bill and that the issue of legislation on a

referendum was not discussed during negotiations on the Queen's Speech.



Douglas Alexander, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, described it as "the

latest panicked response from the Prime Minister who is now following, rather

than leading his backbenchers".



Cameron has been infuriated by cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Philip Hammond

saying on Sunday they would leave the EU if there was a referendum now. "There

isn't going to be a referendum tomorrow so it is a hypothetical question,"

Cameron said yesterday. He accused those predicting he will secure only

inconsequential concessions from Brussels of "throwing in the towel".

Michael White's sketch: All hail the health service - but not the EU



BYLINE: Michael White



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 613 words





With the Sharif clan back in office in Pakistan and the Castros hanging on in

Cuba it seemed appropriate yesterday that one of Britain's own landed dynasties

should make a statesman's tilt at a great issue of our time. Up to history's

challenge stepped Nicholas Soames, through whose veins course the blood and

brandy of his grandfather and wartime prime minister.



Admittedly Soames had decided to make his Churchillian oration during the NHS

stage of the annual debate on the Queen's Speech and to do so on the topical but

tenuously connected subject of Europe. But when destiny calls a Churchill the

summons must be answered immediately, accompanied by a whisky and soda. In

taking on the baying ranks of his own party Soames answered the call as grandpa

so often did (sometimes wisely).



Up to that point the debate had been dire. The NHS's new cheerleader, Jeremy

Hunt, made a complacent speech on the service's "heroic" performance in tough

times, as incumbent health secretaries must. Then Labour's Andy Burnham warned

how the arteries of our once-thriving hospitals are being clogged up by Tory

policies, as ex-health secretaries usually do. Between the pair of them and

eager supporters they blamed each other.



But Europe kept barging its way into the conversation like a drunk in a pub.

Labour's Frank Dobson complained that the Tories have opened the NHS to

predatory US health firms via EU contract law, Thatcherite Tory Edward Leigh

asked Burnham if he would grant the British people a referendum on Europe. "Mad

obsessives," was the drift of Burnham's reply. What about the NHS?



So Soames's magisterial intervention came like a burst of Chopin's First Ballade

(Opus 23) during Britain's Got Talent, a tiger stalking the Battersea Dogs Home,

an Eiger dumped on the gentle North Downs above his Mid-Sussex constituency. He

even boomed in the unapologetically posh way Etonians used to speak before rough

trade like the Camerons were admitted and Estuary English became a GCSE subject.



The thrust of Soames's pro-European remarks was that young Cameron had made a

promise and that should be enough. His stated EU policy should certainly not be

challenged by the "prejudice or pub rhetoric"of some Tory MPs - no names - or

their "hysterical, knee-jerk, publicity-seeking acts." He spoke of trust and the

integrity of government, of a momentous decision affecting generations unborn.



It was magnificent stuff and, like many of grandpa's speeches in his wilderness

years (1931-39), was received with thinly-populated indifference and a solitary

"hear,hear." NHS buffs are immune to appeals to history further back than 1948

and Eurosceptics cherish the conceit that grandpa would have been on their side,

along with Nigel Farage: for brandy and cigar, read pints.



But Soames's speech certainly raised the dreary tone. Two speeches later

Labour's Ann Clywd silenced her chattering audience simply by reading letters

sent by voters about poor nursing care of elderly parents. It was shameful.

Hospital buzzer buttons and water glasses deliberately left out of reach,

frightened old people left in pain or hunger while nurses chattered about their

social life. A man saying goodbye to his father before the life support machine

is turned off being asked "Can we crack on now?"



Hunt and Burnham fell silent along with all the others. It was bad luck that the

next speaker was Charles Walker, the self-styled "fruitcake" Tory brave enough

to have once admitted to obsessive compulsive disorder. After genially praising

Soames ("a great statesman") he confessed to personal Euroscepticism, then said:

"I do want to crack on now." Watch out for the switch on that life support

machine, Dave.

Politics: Cameron in Washington: Obama offers a hand on EU to his 'friend and

partner'



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt in Washington



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 10



LENGTH: 519 words





British prime ministers are advised to show a little humility when the US

president receives them in the East Room of the White House.



Hanging on the wall is the Lansdowne portrait of 1797, depicting George

Washington, which was rescued during the burning of Washington in 1814 when

British troops set fire to public buildings throughout the city.



Still, despite the reminder of a not always easy relationship, Obama hailed

Cameron as his "friend and partner" at the start of a joint press conference

after an hour of talks in the Oval Office. Obama's gushing language was in the

familiar tradition of recent US presidents who score an easy hit with visiting

British prime ministers by lavishing them with praise and hailing the

Anglo-American special relationship.



But this time Obama went further and offered Cameron some useful cover as he

tries to fight growing pressure in the Conservative party to hold an immediate

in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership.



In a rare intervention in the internal workings of an allied country, Obama

said: "You probably want to see if you can fix what is broken in a very

important relationship before you break it off. It makes some sense to me."



The president's carefully scripted remarks produced paroxysms of excitement

among aides with the prime minister. "Most powerful man on earth supports PM's

position," one said.



Obama's intervention on such a touchstone issue for Cameron shows how the prime

minister has succeeded in forging a relationship that goes beyond the usual

pleasantries. The president, whose respect for Cameron grew when he took such a

strong stance on Libya, is now prepared to go out on a limb and help his "friend

and partner" when he faces pressure back home. But Obama indicated that his

support would not be unconditional, as he gave a gentle hint of US unease about

the prime minister's plans to renegotiate Britain's EU membership terms if he

wins the 2015 general election.



The president said he would wait to see the outcome of the negotiations before

giving a judgment. Obama even suggested the negotiations may not be successful

when he said he "would be interested in seeing whether or not those are

successful before rendering a final judgment".



The nuanced messages from Obama on the EU show the president thinks the pressure

on Cameron is palpably wrongheaded and should be resisted. But his clarion call

for Britain to remain in the EU - as a way of strengthening both British and US

interests - shows that Obama believes a battle lies ahead of potentially global

significance.



The prime minister greeted the support from Obama with good grace as he saw the

president deprive some eurosceptics of a vital weapon in their armoury - that

Britain should choose the US over the EU.



But he was not afraid to voice his unease over a failure to act on Syria as he

announced an extra £10m to fund non-lethal weaponry to the Syrian opposition.

Politics: Ukip surge in polls unprecedented since creation of the SDP in 1981:

Potential effect on general election hard to predict Tories suffer, but Labour

and Lib Dems also hit



BYLINE: Tom Clark



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 10



LENGTH: 980 words





In the hunt for historical precedents for Ukip's breakthrough today, three full

decades of Guardian/ICM polling disappoint. The Green party briefly registered

8% in July 1989, after performing spectacularly well in the European elections

of the same year, but that is less than half the 18% achieved by the surging

fourth party which has leaped into third place.



To find a sharper disruption to the settled pattern of polling it is necessary

to go back to the creation of the SDP in 1981. Gallup briefly recorded that

party's new alliance with the Liberals hitting a startling 50%.



While it is the Conservatives who continue to pay the heaviest price for Ukip's

arrival as a major player in national polls, the detailed data confirms that the

Liberal Democrats and latterly Labour are also now seeping serious support. Back

in April, when Ukip were on 9% nationwide, 10% of Tory voters at the 2010

election had defected to Nigel Farage's party, compared with 2% of 2010 Labour

voters and 8% of 2010 Lib Dems. The defection has now gathered pace: over a

quarter of Cameron's 2010 backers, 27%, had switched to Ukip by May. Some 13% of

2010 Labour supporters have gone the same way, together with 12% of 2010 Lib

Dems.



Figuring out how Farage's current support would cash in at a general election is

fraught with difficulty, because under Britain's first-past-the-post system

everything depends on where votes are concentrated, and with Ukip having been so

much smaller in 2010 past experience offers little guide. Mechanically applying

a uniform surge in Ukip support underlines how tough it is for a new party to

break through. Using the new ICM figures, the Electoral Calculus model projects

that the next parliament would end up with 228 Tory seats (down 79), 359 Labour

(up 101, and enough for an overall majority of 68) and 35 for the Lib Dems

(implying 22 losses). In this scenario, Ukip would be left with no seats at all,

its voters left even more under-represented than SDP supporters in 1983 - when

the Alliance was left with a mere 23 seats from more than a quarter of the vote.



In the recent council elections Ukip surprised number-crunchers by picking up as

many seats as it did by winning where it mattered. But even if it can get better

at concentrating votes through targeted campaigns, it will face an uphill

struggle to secure more than a handful of MPs.



Founded exactly 20 years ago, on the single issue of taking Britain out of the

then-new European Union, a nationwide surge of Euroscepticism would be the

obvious explanation for Ukip's ascendency - but there is no strong evidence for

that in the poll. Although most people would like a say on Europe, there is no

sense of urgency. Little more than one voter in every three (35%) demands an

instant referendum, compared with 13% who are content to wait till general

election day, and 30% who are happy to wait longer - until after David Cameron's

promised renegotiation of membership. Some 14% say that the referendum should

never take place at all.



Just before the prime minister's January speech, which first floated the

prospect of an in/out plebiscite, ICM found a 51%-40% majority for quitting the

EU. Far from rushing their leaders towards the door, voters have cooled on the

idea since, and opinion is now almost evenly split: 43% say they would vote to

quit, against a steady 40% who are inclined to stay in.



Since January there has actually been a four-point drop in the proportion saying

they would definitely vote for Britain to leave the EU (a figure that now stands

at 32%) and also in the proportion who would probably vote to leave (now 11%).

Twice as many voters as before now say they are unsure about how they would vote

- 17% as compared with 8% in January.



Other recent polling by IpsosMori suggests that fewer than one voter in every 10

regards Europe as the most pressing issue facing the country, a fraction of

those who named it as such in the late 1990s.



All of this should give pause for thought to the Tory MPs who will tomorrow use

a vote in the Commons to try to force Cameron to write his referendum promise

into law, but it also renders Ukip's sudden surge more mysterious. Success in

the shire elections has secured publicity, and thereby begotten more success -

but that still leaves those shire election results in need of explanation. The

poll suggests that disgruntlement about a political class perceived as

hopelessly out of touch could be the real root cause.



The fury of a Ukip vote - which is disproportionately male (25% of men), elderly

(23% of pensioners) and poor (27% of voters in the unskilled DE occupational

grade) - is not restricted to Europe, but is far more diffuse. They dislike Ed

Miliband (76% say he is doing a bad job) almost as much as the EU (which 77% say

they would definitely vote to quit). They are scarcely keener on David Cameron;

the way he does his job gets the thumbs-down from 68% of Ukip supporters. And

55% believe David Cameron and Nick Clegg are wrong to try and govern together in

coalition.



In their distaste for Britain's established political leaders, the mood of Ukip

voters is simply a more extreme version of that besetting voters as a whole. The

wider electorate flips the thumbs down at Miliband by a 48%-26% margin,

virtually unchanged from the nadir he registered last month, and by 50%-35% it

does the same towards Cameron.



Against this sort of competition, it is not hard to shine, but Farage's own

ratings - with 40% saying he is doing well against 23% who say the opposite -

are remarkably positive for any politician in these anti-political times.



ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by

telephone on 10-12 May 2013. Interviews were conducted across the country and

the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of

the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.

Leading Article: Guardian/ICM poll: None of the above



BYLINE: Editorial



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 30



LENGTH: 680 words





Opinion polls are the miners' canaries of democracy: on occasion they indicate

something very nasty indeed coming down the tunnel. So our latest Guardian/ICM

poll ought to keep every political leader awake at night. The "none of the

above" party is now vying with the Tories for second place; a total of 27% of

voters are opting either for Ukip or one of the nationalist parties or the

Greens. That's a record jump of 11 points on last month, and it includes a small

but worrying increase in support for the BNP. It's not just a governing party

problem either, now. The surge for the "others" has hit them all. Each has lost

four points in a rejection of British mainstream politics without modern

precedent. Party leaders have some very hard thinking to do.



Almost the only certainty in all this is that a row over the tactics of a

European referendum, such as the one distracting David Cameron as he tries to do

business with President Obama, will only confirm voters in their suspicion that

politicians inhabit a parallel universe. It is clear from the regular Ipsos-Mori

issues index that - as Ed Miliband pointed out again at the weekend - it is not

Europe but the economy that remains by far the biggest concern for most voters.

Since 2005, when the rejection of the European constitution appeared to mark the

high water mark of integration, the proportion of voters reporting that they are

concerned about Europe has never gone above 10%, even if it has recently risen

slightly amid the eurozone's woes.



This has two implications. First, Britain's place in Europe is a much bigger and

more serious issue than many voters seem ready to acknowledge. The nature of the

UK's relationship is changing, as the continent develops an increasingly

consolidated inner core over which Britain has diminishing influence. This will

matter greatly over the next decade. It is more important than narrow party

advantage. However, instead of argument over the substance - echoes here of John

Major's Maastricht misery - Mr Cameron finds himself abroad (and at sea) as

rebels mount a challenge round a piece of parliamentary procedure: the vote on

the Queen's speech. As a result, Mr Cameron has had to allow his most senior

ministers to abstain rather than back their own government's business programme.

There is a precedent for this, but not an auspicious one. The last prime

minister unable to rally his own cabinet in support of official policy was

Harold Wilson in 1975, forced in the referendum on Europe to let the original

Eurosceptics campaign against staying in.



It is appealing to see Europe as some kind of a surrogate issue for a more

generalised sense of powerlessness and discontent that feeds into a mistrust of

all parties. That's the argument the rebels make in defence of their demand for

a commitment to a referendum before the 2015 general election. But it does not

appear to be how voters are thinking. Since David Cameron's January promise of a

referendum after renegotiation, the balance of opinion has swung very marginally

in favour of staying put. That suggests that rocketing support for Nigel Farage,

Ukip's leader, may owe at least as much to his attraction as an outsider as to

his anti-immigration, anti-European stance.



Historically, the kind of surge our poll has found rarely lasts. But this

extended economic stagnation, the impact of persistently high unemployment and

frozen earnings, is creating a new and potentially malign political landscape.

Voters are frustrated by the government's apparent inability to defend them. Mr

Farage seems to meet an appetite, fanned by a press that has an active

self-interest in promoting weak government, for dramatic solutions. The

popularity of coalition as an idea has fallen sharply from its high three years

ago. But the stronger the support for Mr Farage, the dimmer are the prospects

for the clear mandate that voters now say they favour and for which both Labour

and Conservatives yearn. Coalition is becoming more likely and less popular than

at the same stage in the last election. Voters need to wise up, too.

Sketch: All hail the NHS - but not Europe

Front: Cabinet crisis for Cameron as ministers break ranks over EU: Gove and

Hammond say they would vote to leave European Union



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt and Rajeev Syal



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 824 words





David Cameron is struggling to maintain Tory discipline over Europe after

cabinet loyalists Michael Gove and Philip Hammond said yesterday they would vote

to leave the European Union if a referendum were to be held now.



Gove, the education minister, confirmed for the first time that he believes that

leaving the EU would have "certain advantages", while Hammond, the defence

secretary, later said he too would vote to leave if he was asked to endorse the

EU "exactly as it is today".



The timing of their comments will cause consternation for the prime minister as

he attends talks with Barack Obama in the White House, where he will press for

an EU-US trade deal that he claims would bring £10bn of annual benefits to

Britain.



The remarks, which follow similar calls by Lord Lawson and Michael Portillo last

week for Britain to leave Europe, are particularly significant because they are

the first cabinet ministers to say they would vote to quit if an immediate

referendum were held.



The prime minister's enthusiastic endorsement of an EU trade deal, which will be

negotiated with the US by the EU as a whole, stood in marked contrast to the

intervention by Gove, who said Britain could prosper outside the EU.



Dozens of Tory MPs are preparing to vote in favour of a backbench amendment to

the motion welcoming the Queen's speech, which is expected on Wednesday,

regretting the absence of an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership.



The remarks by Gove, described as "unhelpful" by party officials, went slightly

further than Hammond, who said that it was "defeatist" to argue in favour of

withdrawal because the prime minister would negotiate a better deal for Britain.



Gove told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 that he would abstain in the vote after

No 10 said ministers would be free to take the rare step of declining to offer

support for the Queen's speech. No 10 is offering backbenchers a free vote and

ministers the right to abstain.



The prime minister says that, if elected with a majority in 2015, he would hold

a referendum by 2017. This would take place after a renegotiation of Britain's

membership terms.



Friends of Gove told the Mail on Sunday last year he had said Britain should

leave the EU unless substantial powers were repatriated. Asked whether he stood

by those private remarks, he said: "Yes, I'm not happy with our position in the

EU."



Gove said he supported the plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU

membership after the election. But he added that life outside the EU could have

benefits. "My preference is for a change in Britain's relationship with the

European Union. My ideal is exactly what the majority of the British public's

ideal is, which is to recognise the current situation is no good, to say that

life outside would be perfectly tolerable, we could contemplate it, there would

be certain advantages.



"But the best deal for Europe, and for Britain, would be if Britain were to lead

the change that Europe needs." Explaining his abstention, he said: "I'm going to

abstain . . . it's an exercise in letting off steam."



Hammond, interviewed for Pienaar's Politics on BBC radio, said: "If the choice

is between a European Union written exactly as it is today and not being a part

of that then I have to say that I'm on the side of the argument that Michael

Gove has put forward."



Theresa May, the home secretary, said she too would abstain. But she declined to

say whether she would vote to leave the EU if a referendum were held now. The

prime minister will be in the US when the Commons vote is held.



Yesterday, Boris Johnson backed Tory backbench demands for an EU referendum bill

and warned Cameron he must make it clear Britain is "ready to walk away" unless

its relationship is fundamentally reformed,



But the mayor of London also suggested that leaving the EU would expose the idea

that most of Britain's problems are self-inflicted. "If we left the EU, we would

end this sterile debate, and we would have to recognise that most of our

problems are not caused by 'Bwussels', but by chronic British short-termism,

inadequate management, sloth, low skills, a culture of easy gratification and

underinvestment in both human and physical capital and infrastructure," Johnson

wrote in his Daily Telegraph column.



"Why are we still, person for person, so much less productive than the Germans?

That is now a question more than a century old, and the answer is nothing to do

with the EU. In or out of the EU, we must have a clear vision of how we are

going to be competitive in a global economy."



Ministers have been excluded from a free vote granted to Tory backbenchers to

support the rebel amendment - with about 100 MPs expected to take the rare step

of formally criticising their own government's legislative programme.



Cameron will show he believes Britain's long-term future lies in the EU by

saying at the meeting with Obama that next month's G8 summit must launch

negotiations on the EU-US free trade area. .

National: Cameron running scared on EU, says Miliband: PM may back Tory rebels'

referendum amendment: Johnson says withdrawal would not be cataclysmic



BYLINE: Rajeev Syal



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 619 words





David Cameron is "hiding behind the sofa" from Tory backbenchers, Ed Miliband

claims today, after it emerged that the prime minister may take the

unprecedented step of supporting a vote in parliament condemning his own

legislative programme because it does not propose a vote on EU membership.



The Labour leader will claim that the prime minister's decision to back an

amendment to the Queen's speech which criticises the absence of an in-out

referendum reveals an obsession with the party's interests instead of the

country's.



Miliband's speech comes as Cameron faces further pressure on Europe from senior

party figures. Yesterday, Boris Johnson said that withdrawal would not be

"cataclysmic" for British jobs, as Europhiles claim. The mayor of London was

speaking after Tory grandees Lord Lawson and Michael Portillo this week

advocated withdrawal from the EU and Tory backbenchers sought a referendum

amendment to the Queen's speech. Internal Conservative rows over Europe have

escalated following the strong showing of Ukip in the local elections this

month.



Miliband's speech, to the annual conference of the Blairite thinktank Progress,

will also be seen as an attempt to stamp his authority on his own party after

YouGov polling showed that his personal polling has hardly improved over the

last year.



Miliband will say: "We have the extraordinary spectacle of a government that

says it is relaxed about its own MPs voting against its own Queen's speech.



"He (Cameron) is not lying on the sofa relaxed. He's hiding behind the sofa, too

scared to confront his own MPs. He is flailing around, directionless, unable to

show the leadership the country needs."



The reason for this weakness, Miliband will say, is that Cameron has allowed

backbench MPs to push him around. "That's the only reason he changed his mind in

January on his previous position on an in/out referendum. It wasn't about the

national interest, it was simply about his party interest."



Conservative MPs have engineered a vote on an EU referendum by tabling an

amendment to the Queen's speech. The move has the support of longstanding

Eurosceptics such as John Redwood, Peter Bone, Edward Leigh, Bernard Jenkin and

David Davis. It is likely that the Speaker will accept the amendment, with a

vote in the Commons on Tuesday or Wednesday.



It is unlikely the amendment will be passed, as the Lib Dems will oppose it

along with the vast majority of Labour MPs, but significant minority support

within the Tories would be seized upon as an indication that Cameron is being

dictated to by his party's backbenches.



Yesterday, the prime minister's spokesman refused to rule out supporting the

amendment. "The amendment's only recently been tabled, so the PM would want to

carefully consider it. The key point here is that he has always made it clear

that he will look at all ways of strengthening his commitment to an in/out

referendum in the next parliament."



The prime minister is even considering voting for the change to the government's

programme, though this is highly unlikely because he is due to be in the US next

week. At present Cameron wants to hold the referendum after he has completed

negotiations with his EU partners after the 2015 general election.



Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We should be prepared to pull out.

That goes without saying. You can't go into a negotiation like that without

being willing to walk away."



He insisted that withdrawal would not be as damaging to the UK economy as

pro-Europeans claim. "I don't think it would be anything like as cataclysmic as

is being sometimes pretended," he said.

Front: Coalition rift widens amid rows over EU and childcare



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 859 words





Just a day after an elaborate display of unity over the Queen's speech, the

coalition has come to blows over key policies with No 10 accusing Nick Clegg of

shamelessly reneging on agreed childcare reforms, and the Liberal Democrats

countering that Tory MPs were being given licence by David Cameron to vote

against government policy on Europe.



The tension and at times bitter briefing yesterday have underlined the challenge

both parties face maintaining a functioning coalition as they continue to poll

poorly and as the 2015 general election draws nearer.



Both leaderships had hoped the programme formally announced by the Queen on

Wednesday would mark a turning point in their fortunes in the wake of last

week's disappointing showing for their parties in the local elections. But

instead Clegg was forced to concede he had rejected a key plank of the

coalition's childcare strategy.



Faced by massive opposition from pre-school lobby groups, Clegg said he was now

opposed to previously agreed plans to relax staff-to-child ratios in nurseries.



"When we as a government consulted on changing the number of little toddlers

that each adult can look after, the response from experts, from parents from

nurseries was overwhelmingly negative," Clegg said. "They felt that the risks

outweighed the benefits and it wouldn't necessarily reduce costs. So that's what

I still have reservations about, about this change."



But, faced by Labour claims that the coalition was descending into chaos on key

issues, Liz Truss, the Conservative children's minister, insisted ministers were

only "currently consulting on the level of qualifications required to put those

ratios in place", implying the ratios policy itself was immutable.



Tory ministerial sources privately accused the Liberal Democrats' leader of

leaking his new opposition in order to grub for votes among women. "We had all

these discussions before the coalition came to an agreed position, so why he is

jumping ship now?" said one.



But hours later Cameron, dogged by the issue of a European referendum for the

fourth day in a row, also shifted ground when he found himself outmanoeuvred by

his Eurosceptic rebels. In a rare move, heavyweight Tory backbenchers tabled an

amendment to acceptance of the Queen's speech, regretting the lack of a bill in

the speech paving the way for an EU referendum. The amendment will be voted on

next Tuesday.



Faced by the prospect of large-scale rebellion, Downing Street suggested Tory

ministers would be given a free vote next week, adding that Cameron was relaxed

about how his MPs voted. Supporters of the backbench Eurosceptic amendment,

including the former shadow home secretary David Davis, say it is carefully

worded to back the prime minister's position.



Cameron has told Conservative MPs he would like to introduce a bill guaranteeing

a referendum by 2017, but has been unable to do so because the Lib Dems

disagree.



The prime minister's spokesman said: "He is relaxed about (the amendment). He is

happy to look at all ways of strengthening his commitment to an in/out

referendum in the next parliament."



The spokesman suggested that people should not be surprised if Conservative and

Lib Dem ministers voted on opposite sides if the amendment was, as expected,

called by the Speaker.



Cameron will miss the vote because he will be in the US. The prime minister's

spokesman said: "The differences on this specific issue between the two parties

in the coalition are well known."



Asked whether the prime minister would be happy for ministers to vote for the

amendment, the spokesman said: "The prime minister is relaxed about it. The

implication of that is clear."



The Lib Dems mocked the Tory position. A spokesman said: "We will be voting with

the government which has a position on an EU referendum. This is that if there

is a major change in the balance of powers there will be a referendum."



But Clegg is frustrated that the Tories are allowing Europe to dominate the

fallout of the Queen's speech, overshadowing domestic issues, such as the new

single-tier pension and the new cap on social care costs.



The spokesman said: "The government needs to get out and tell people about the

good things in the Queen's speech and not spend another week bemoaning the

absence of a referendum."



Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former foreign secretary, weighed into the debate

following the intervention of other Tory grandees, Lord Lawson and Michael

Portillo, who said this week that Britain would be better off out of the EU.



Rifkind said Lawson had thrown the equivalent of a "hand grenade into a small

building" by calling for Britain to leave.



Boris Johnson, the London mayor, and the former Tory chancellor Lord Lamont,

said Britain should be prepared to leave the EU if the prime minister failed to

renegotiate better membership terms.



Johnson told ITV News London: "We need a renegotiation to get rid of some of

that nonsense and to make the whole area more competitive, and if that fails,

then yes obviously we should be ready to walk away, we should be ready to

leave."

Expenses watchdog sues MP in attempt to reclaim £54,000



BYLINE: Rajeev Syal



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 484 words





A Conservative MP is being sued by parliament's expenses watchdog after refusing

to pay £54,000 he is alleged to have made in capital gains on his publicly

funded home.



Stewart Jackson, the MP for Peterborough, is facing the high court action by the

Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) after denying that he owes

all of the money.



The unprecedented legal case has been launched as 28 other MPs have agreed to

repay almost £500,000 they are alleged to have made in profits after months of

behind the scenes wrangling involving party whips and lawyers. Some MPs have

claimed, off the record, that they are being victimised because of years of

expenses abuses by their predecessors.



The watchdog moved to ban the use of Commons expenses to pay mortgage interest

in May 2010, in the wake of public fury about abuses. Transitional arrangements

were put in place permitting MPs elected before 2010 to keep claiming the money

up to last August - as long as they agreed to return any potential capital gain.



Some 71 members received about £1m in allowances for mortgage interest during

the period. Properties were valued in 2010 and 2012, and the MPs were given

until 30 November to return a proportion of any gain. The process was delayed

when some signalled that they were considering a legal challenge on the grounds

that the watchdog had overstepped its powers.



Jackson, a member of the public accounts committee, said Ipsa's legal

proceedings were heavy-handed and disproportionate and were clearly intended to

bully him into submission.



"The essence of the dispute is my challenge of the valuations of 2010 and 2012.

Ipsa are seeking a cash sum on a so-called capital gain 'profit' on my family

home, in which I live and have not sold. The money which Ipsa is demanding

retrospectively is more than the total amount I received when I was claiming

mortgage interest and the property is now valued at less than we purchased it

for in 2005."



Jackson, who resigned as a junior minister in 2010 after voting against a

three-line whip on an EU referendum, wrote that he would challenge the

watchdog's claim that his family home - which he bought for £470,000 in December

2005 - increased in value by 20% at a time when he says house prices in the area

were falling.



In total, the 71 MPs claimed £926,159.75 of taxpayer cash to cover mortgage

interest over the 15-month period, with the largest claims made by Labour's

Michael Connarty - who received £34,168 relating to a property in London, of

which he has returned £6,833 - and Jackson, who received £32,494.



A spokesman for Ipsa said: "One of the most damaging aspects of the expenses

scandal was the practice where MPs got taxpayer support to own a second home.

That is why we said we would stop this, and we have now done so."

Front: Offenders face supervision by private firms: Tough 12-month regime for

prisoners after release will include drug tests



BYLINE: Alan Travis and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 1069 words





More than 50,000 short-sentence prisoners a year are to be given new 12-month

compulsory supervision orders under rehabilitation plans run by private

companies and charities to be announced by the justice secretary, Chris

Grayling, today.



Ministry of Justice officials say the plans - which could prevent former

prisoners from moving to a different area and subject them to compulsory tests

for class B drugs such as cannabis - represent the most significant change to

short custodial sentences in a decade.



The 12-month period of statutory supervision by companies such as G4S or Serco

on payment-by-results contracts will apply to all offenders sent to prison for

under two years, including petty criminals jailed just for a few days for

offences such as non-payment of a fine.



Grayling's announcement is the first detailed government plan to be outlined in

the wake of yesterday's Queen's speech.



David Cameron said the package of bills marked a "ruthless" attempt to refocus

the work of the government on "hard-working families" as Downing Street removed

what the Tories' new campaign director, Lynton Crosby, referred to as "the

barnacles off the boat" from its legislative programme.



Omissions from the Queen's speech, such as a minimum price for alcohol and plain

packaging for cigarettes, were designed to streamline the work of the

government, Cameron said. Of the 15 bills unveiled by the Queen, nine are

focused on promoting economic growth.



Ed Miliband mocked the prime minister for dismissing Ukip as clowns but now

"joining the circus" by swerving to the right. The Labour leader said Cameron

had tried to imitate Ukip by pledging in his EU speech in January to hold a

referendum by 2017 and by now making no mention of the gay marriage bill in the

Queen's speech. This has been carried over from the previous session.



The Liberal Democrats were disappointed that a bill to enshrine Britain's

commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on overseas aid by the end of

this year was not included in the Queen's speech. But they insisted the speech

bore the "imprints of the Lib Dems all over it".



Party sources said the single-tier pension would not have been introduced

without the work of Lib Dem ministers Steve Webb and Norman Lamb. A bill will

cap the costs of social care at £72,000.



However there signs of a coalition rift opening last night when a spokesman for

Nick Clegg confirmed that he is objecting to plans by Liz Truss, the children's

minister, to cut the costs of childcare by allowing nurseries and childminders

to look after more children.



A spokesman said Clegg had yet to be persuaded that the plans, which are not in

the Queen's speech, would improve childcare of reduce costs.



The Lib Dems were supportive of the immigration bill, which will impose fines on

private landlords who fail to check the status of illegal immigrants and place

restrictions on migrants' use of the NHS. The bill will not be introduced by the

time labour market restrictions are lifted on Romanians and Bulgarians next

January.



Government sources said the main measures aimed at citizens from the newest EU

member states will be introduced through secondary legislation by next January.

These include withdrawing most jobseeker benefits from citizens from European

Economic Area countries who fail to find work after six months.



Grayling's offender rehabilitation bill, to be published today, will introduce

powers to require released offenders to undergo compulsory drug tests for

cannabis for the first time while they are living in the community under

supervision.



Those who test positive will face penalties and be required to attend

appointments with the drug treatment services. While they are in the community

the offenders, who will probably have to wear a new generation of GPS satellite

tracking tags, will have to comply with a programme of support on housing,

employment, training and alcohol and drug treatment.



There will be a new emphasis on using reformed offenders to act as mentors to

those newly released from prison. Those who fail to comply or misbehave will

face being recalled to jail.



Short-sentence prisoners serving 12 months or less currently have the highest

reconviction rate, with 58% found guilty of a fresh offence within a year.



Under the MoJ plans the extended period of compulsory supervision and

rehabilitation will also apply to a further 15,000 prisoners a year who serve

sentences between 12 months and two years and are already subject to shorter

periods of being released on licence.



The current 130 prisons in England and Wales are to be reorganised, with 70 -

more than half - moving into a national network of resettlement prisons.



Offenders will be released into the local area where their rehab and supervision

programme is to take place and will be banned from moving to other parts of the

country without permission.



Grayling has turbocharged this next phase of the government's "rehabilitation

revolution" by demanding it is in place by the 2015 general election.



The justice secretary is also to confirm his plan for the privatisation of 70%

of the probation workload of supervising 240,000 offenders a year.



Partnerships between private companies and voluntary sector organisations will

be invited to bid to take over the supervision of all low- and medium-risk

offenders in 21 contract areas.



The role of the 100-year-old public probation service is to be restricted to the

30% of work that involves high-risk offenders and public protection issues.



Grayling said: "These reforms represent a golden opportunity to turn the tide

and put a stopper in the revolving door of the justice system.



"It is simply not good enough that we spend £4bn a year on prisons and

probation, and yet make no real dent in the appetite of offenders to commit more

crime. It is little wonder when many of our most prolific criminals leave prison

totally unsupervised in the community."



A G4S spokesman said the company was well placed to deliver the kind of

innovations the government was looking at. He claimed its long history of

working with offenders in partnership with the public and voluntary sectors

meant G4S had developed substantial expertise.



Prison reform groups voiced concerns. Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust

said rehabilitation on release made sense but there was a danger an inflexible

approach to those who breach the conditions of their release could refill the

prisons.

Queen's speech: Populist agenda puts PM in Ukip's circus ring, says Miliband:

Tories may face battle with Lib Dems over migrants' use of NHS as Labour alleges

Cameron trying to 'out-Farage Farage'



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 8



LENGTH: 926 words





Ed Miliband mocked David Cameron yesterday for joining the Ukip "circus",

accusing the prime minister of attempting to "out-Farage" Nigel Farage, Ukip's

leader, and appearing to distance himself from same-sex marriage legislation in

the Queen's speech.



As a veteran Tory MP warned the prime minister not to appease disgruntled voters

on the right in response to the Ukip surge, the Labour leader said that

insulting or imitating the new fourth force in English politics would fail

because the government had a reality problem.



In his response to the Queen's speech, Miliband said: "They used to call (Ukip)

clowns, now they want to join the circus. The whole point of the prime

minister's speech (on the EU) in January was to head off Ukip. Tory MPs were

crowing the Ukip fox had been shot - job done, mission accomplished. Only it

wasn't.



"The lesson for the prime minister is you can't out-Farage Farage. Banging on

about Europe won't convince the public, and the people behind him will keep

coming back for more. A Europe referendum tomorrow, drop same-sex marriage, the

demands go on. They will never be satisfied." Miliband attacked Cameron after

the government moved to address the concerns raised by voters who have defected

to Ukip by unveiling a new immigration bill in the Queen's speech which will

impose fines on private landlords who fail to check the immigrant status of

their tenants.



Meanwhile, there was no mention of the bill legalising gay marriage, which was

introduced in the last session and is being carried over into the new session.



Under the immigration plans, migrants will also face new restrictions on access

to the NHS, with temporary migrants forced to make a contribution towards the

cost of their care. However, Downing Street admitted that the immigration bill

would not be in place by next January, when labour market restrictions are

lifted on citizens of Romania and Bulgaria. The bill will be introduced after

the summer parliamentary recess, following a consultation on the proposed fines

on private landlords and on the changes in NHS charging.



Government sources said the main measures aimed at Romanians and Bulgarians

would be introduced through secondary legislation that would be in place by next

January. These include a residency test for social housing, a requirement for

migrants to have been resident in the UK for at least 12 months before they are

entitled to claim civil legal aid and the plan to limit most jobseeker benefits

for European Economic Area citizens if they fail to find work within six months.



Cameron told MPs the immigration bill was the centrepiece of the legislative

programme because it cut across all government departments. He said: "For the

first time, we will look to ensure that everyone's immigration status is checked

before they get access to a private rented home. For the first time, we are

going to make sure that anyone not eligible for free healthcare actually foots

the bill for that healthcare, either through themselves or through their

government. And for the first time, foreign nationals who commit serious crimes

will, wherever possible, be deported first and appeal second from their home

country."



Vince Cable, the business secretary, indicated that there may still be a battle

within the coalition over plans to monitor migrants' use of the NHS. He told the

BBC's The World at One that doctors must not be expected to make such checks.



"That is not the role of doctors - doctors are there to provide medical care,"

he said. "There is a question about whether people who administer GPs' surgeries

and hospitals should be in the business of checking. Actually there is a fair

amount of that goes on already."



Cameron indicated that the government had ambitious plans on foreign criminals

when he said that senior ministers had examined plans at a meeting of the

national security council last week to deport foreign nationals as soon as they

are sentenced. He made his remarks after Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the

Commons home affairs select committee, said 4,000 foreign national ex-offenders

were living in the community, 65% of whom had been doing so for two years.



Cameron said to Vaz: "The situation with foreign national offenders is still

completely unacceptable. There are very large numbers still here from countries

like Nigeria, Jamaica and others that we have very good relations with. We are

going to make sure we deal with this problem a lot faster."



Cameron faced criticism for abandoning plans to force tobacco companies to use

plain packaging and to introduce a minimum price for alcohol, but he said: "On

the issue of plain packaging for cigarettes, that consultation is still under

way and we are looking very carefully at that issue. On the issue of minimum

unit pricing for alcohol, I think it is important we take action to deal with

the very deeply discounted alcohol - a can of lager sometimes at as little as

25p in supermarkets. We will be coming forward with a package of measures. That

is important and we need to get that right."



Labour said the tobacco packaging consultation actually closed last August.



Peter Luff, the MP for Mid Worcestershire and former Tory defence minister, who

was the first MP to respond to the Queen's speech as he delivered the

traditional backbench proposal, warned Cameron against attempting to appease

Ukip.



Farage, Ukip's leader, said: "It was a Queen's speech designed to tell Ukip

voters: 'Don't worry, we are dealing with things.'"

Queen's speech: What the Queen said - and what it means



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 8



LENGTH: 856 words





What she said "My government's first priority is to strengthen Britain's

economic competitiveness. My ministers will continue to prioritise measures that

reduce the deficit - ensuring interest rates are kept low for homeowners and

businesses."



What it means Deficit reduction gets a lower profile than it did in the speeches

in 2010 and in 2012. In both those years, it was in the second sentence in the

speech, and described as the government's first priority. But, with borrowing

essentially flat rather than going down, a comment like that was probably deemed

a bit embarrassing.



What she said "A bill will be introduced to reduce the burden of excessive

regulation on businesses. A further bill will make it easier for businesses to

protect their intellectual property. A draft bill will be published establishing

a simple set of consumer rights."



What it means A deregulation bill enacts some measures that emerged from the

government's "red tape challenge", including exempting from health and safety

legislation self-employed people whose work poses no threat to others. An

intellectual property bill will make stealing registered designs and selling

counterfeit products for profit a criminal offence punishable by up to 10 years

in prison. A draft consumer rights bill will ensure that consumer law applies to

the purchase of digital content.



What she said "Legislation will be introduced to enable the building of the High

Speed Two railway line, providing further opportunities for economic growth in

many of Britain's cities. My government will continue with legislation to update

energy infrastructure."



What it means There are actually two high speed rail bills: one, the high speed

rail (preparation) bill, providing the funding for the scheme, and a second, an

HS2 hybrid bill, allowing the project to go ahead. This is one of the few bills

unpopular on the Tory backbenches to get a mention. The energy bill, which will

encourage private investment in the energy sector, is one of several measures

being "carried over" under a procedure used increasingly regularly.



What she said "To make sure that every child has the best start in life,

regardless of background, further measures will be taken to improve the quality

of education for young people."



What it means This is the Michael Gove section of the speech, referring to

school reforms that are already in the pipeline. There is no new legislation

planned in this field, although some of the measures relating to childcare are

included in the children and families bill, another carry over measure.



What she said "My government will bring forward legislation to create a simpler

state pension system that encourages saving and provides more help to those who

have spent years caring for children."



What it means The pensions bill will introduce a single-tier pension scheme, and

increase the state pension age to 67. This is a central part of the government's

pitch to women, who are polling badly for the Tories.



What she said "Legislation will be introduced to reform the way long-term care

is paid for, to ensure the elderly do not have to sell their homes to meet their

care bills."



What it means This is the first major piece of legislation to get a mention in

the speech - the care bill. It will implement the proposals that were put

forward by the government following the Dilnot review capping the amount people

pay towards their elderly care.



What she said "My government will bring forward a bill that further reforms

Britain's immigration system."



What it means The immigration bill is the third big piece of legislation in the

speech, which has been well trailed in advance and read as a response to the

threat from Ukip. The legislation will restrict EU migrants' access to

jobseeker's allowance to six months, issue new guidance to local authorities to

give priority to local people in social housing, and place new responsibilities

on EU member states to pay if their citizens use the NHS.



What she said "My lords and members of the House of Commons, I pray that

blessing of almighty God may rest upon your counsels."



What it means The Queen always ends her speech with a final passage about

foreign policy. Normally, she includes a reference to state visits she will be

making herself. But that's missing this year after the palace's announcement

that her future travel arrangements are under review and that Prince Charles

will be stepping up his role.



The other bills confirmed national insurance contributions bill; local audit

bill; water bill; mesothelioma bill; defence reform bill; Northern Ireland bill;

and a draft Wales bill.



What the Queen didn't say No mention of the full-blown "snooper's charter"

plans, plain packaging for cigarettes, minimum alcohol pricing, guarantees on

overseas aid spending, or a bill to allow MPs to be recalled if constituents are

unhappy with them: basically, anything unpopular with Tory backbenchers or that

might be a dealbreaker in coalition terms. An EU in/out referendum also falls

under this category. Some of the omissions are about the tone of the speech -

the gay marriage bill will still go ahead. Some could be fatal.

Portillo joins growing Tory calls for Britain to leave the EU: Former defence

minister backs Lord Lawson: London mayor also enters fray over referendum



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 16



LENGTH: 403 words





David Cameron faced growing Tory pressure on Europe last night when the former

cabinet minister Michael Portillo threw his weight behind the call by Lord

Lawson for Britain to leave the EU.



As Boris Johnson entered the fray, by saying Britain should be prepared to quit

if it fails to secure better membership terms, Portillo said he fervently hopes

the British people have the guts to vote no.



The intervention by a second Tory grandee came as Charles Moore, Margaret

Thatcher's official biographer, revealed that the late prime minister came to

believe after she left office that Britain should quit the EU. Writing in this

week's issue of the Spectator, Moore says that Thatcher kept her opinion private

after she was advised that her views would push her to the fringes of public

life.



The call this week by Lawson, Thatcher's longest-serving chancellor, for Britain

to leave the EU transformed the debate in the Conservative party by providing

cover for MPs who felt nervous about speaking out.



Portillo today adds fuel to the fire by saying that Britain must leave the EU or

risk finding that it has no choice in the future but to join the euro and to

enter political union with the rest of the EU.



Writing in the Times, which also carried Lawson's article earlier this week,

Portillo says: "The referendum, were it to occur, would not be simply about

withdrawing from the EU or going on as we are. It would really be about pulling

out, or in due course entering political union.



"That is why I would vote no and I fervently hope that the British have more

guts than those who govern us, and more than those who govern us think we have."



Portillo says Lawson is wrong to assert that Britain will have a referendum on

EU membership. Cameron pledged in his speech on the EU in January that he would

hold a referendum by 2017 after negotiating a series of reforms to the EU with

fellow European leaders.



But the former defence secretary writes: "I have not been impressed by Mr

Cameron's pledge. Given his party's electoral prospects, I doubt if he expects

to have to deliver on it. But in any case, he seems to have decided already that

Britain should stay in."



Johnson added to the pressure on Cameron, who claims his strategy is designed to

stabilise Britain's membership in a reformed EU, by saying Britain may have to

leave. The London mayor told the Times that it was "much less clear" that

Britain would suffer if it left.

Front: New curbs on EU migrants in Queen's speech



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 901 words





David Cameron will today make his most concerted effort yet to prevent a

stampede of his core vote to Ukip by unveiling measures to stem the flow of EU

migrants to Britain, including imposing fines on private landlords if they do

not check the immigration status of their tenants.



Landlords will face fines of thousands of pounds under proposals due to be

unveiled in the Queen's speech today.



The political centrepiece of Cameron's third Queen's speech will be a promise to

restrict EU migrants' access to jobseeker's allowance to six months, issue new

guidance to local authorities to give priority to local people in social

housing, and place new responsibilities on EU member states to pay if their

citizens use the NHS.



There will also be tougher fines on businesses that use illegal labour.



The six-month restriction to jobseeker's allowance will apply to all EU

nationals who are not actively seeking work and cannot show that they have a

genuine chance of getting work.



Cameron will introduce a new residence test requiring most individuals to be

lawfully resident in the UK for at least 12 months before they gain access to

civil legal aid. But the measures, designed to slow the flow of workers to the

UK, come only a day before new EU commission proposals designed to make it

easier for EU citizens to work anywhere in the EU.



Cameron hopes that such raw meat will soothe the disaffection on the right that

was revealed in last week's local elections. But he will also hope to quell the

growing clamour on the Tory backbenches for a referendum bill on EU membership

in this parliamentary session.



An exasperated Cameron was yesterday forced to welcome a call from the

81-year-old Lord Lawson for Britain to quit the EU. The former chancellor said

it was a bureaucratic monstrosity damaging the interests of the City of London.

Cameron found himself on the back foot, defending his plans to renegotiate the

terms of Britain's EU membership in the face of Lawson's contemptuous assessment

that he will secure only "piffling changes".



As Conservative MPs hailed Lawson for creating a "game-changing" moment, the

prime minister rejected Lawson's intervention and insisted he would be able to

secure real changes in Britain's membership terms.



"I want to give people a choice not between the status quo and leaving the

European Union," the prime minister said at a conference on Somalia in London.



"I want to give people a proper choice between Britain remaining in a reformed

EU or leaving that EU. That's the choice that people will have. That is the

choice that people want. And there is only one way to get it and that will be by

supporting the Conservatives at the next election. Frankly, I welcome the

attention that is being put on this very clear promise."



But Bernard Jenkin, the former shadow defence secretary, sided with Lawson,

saying it was "moonshine" for No 10 to assume Cameron could reform the EU.



Some Tories responded to Lawson's remarks by saying he had afforded

respectability to Ukip. They also said that the former chancellor had given

cover to anti-EU Tory MPs who have been nervous about speaking out.



One MP said: "The Lawson intervention is transformational; it is potentially a

game changing moment. Ukip can say to us: 'You said we were fruitcakes and now

Margaret Thatcher's longest-serving chancellor says we are right.' Conservatives

who want to leave the EU but who have been nervous about saying so will now feel

less worried about saying that."



Lawson's intervention, in The Times yesterday, also led to an array of Tory MPs

touring the TV studios to argue over Britain's relationship with the EU.



The latest development has probably crushed Cameron's lingering hope that he had

manage to shelve the EU issue by promising in January that he would hold an

in-out referendum after the 2015 election. With the Liberal Democrats opposed to

a bill on a referendum ahead of the election, the prime minister is unable to

satisfy his backbench rebels.



Theresa May, the home secretary, will use the immigration bill, due to be fully

published in the autumn, to address another touchstone issue by recasting the

law to make it easier to deport suspected criminals or terrorists such as the

Muslim preacher Abu Qatada.



May will change the law to make it impossible for such figures to remain in the

UK by citing Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, and the right to family life.



Ministers say the Article had been abused by criminals to circumvent rules that

automatically deport any offender sentenced to more than 12 months in prison.

She has already issued guidance to the UK judiciary, but believes only the full

force of a change in the law will persuade UK judges not to defer to the Human

Rights Act in such cases.



Cameron's aides insisted the emphasis on the EU and immigration in the Queen's

speech had been decided ahead of Ukip's surge. They argued that the whole of the

speech should be seen through the prism of Cameron's twin themes of winning the

global race and backing those who work hard to get on in life.



The PM will acknowledge how tough voters are finding the squeeze on living

standards, saying: "We knew the road ahead would be tough, and so it has proved.

But three years on, our resolve to turn our country around has never been

stronger."

Leading Article: Mistaking plans for Nigel: Britain and Europe



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 28



LENGTH: 681 words





Trouble, thy name is Nigel. Or so it must seem to David Cameron. In a week, the

prime minister's authority has been rocked by Nigel Farage, shaken by the Nigel

Evans allegations and now openly challenged by the most important Nigel in

recent Conservative history. It is 24 years since Nigel Lawson's resignation

signalled the endgame of Margaret Thatcher's premiership. And it needs to be

stressed that, for most people under the age of 40, the former chancellor is

much less of a name these days than his daughter. Nevertheless, Lord Lawson

proved this week that, at 81, he is still one of the most articulate figures in

politics and has lost none of his sense of theatre. By saying, on the eve of the

Queen's Speech, that he thinks Britain should now quit the European Union, he

has poured petrol on the flames already licking through the Conservative mansion

after last week's local election defeats.



There can be no disputing that Lord Lawson's change of heart on the EU - he

voted yes to British membership, along with Lady Thatcher herself, back in 1975

- reflects his party's own historic change of view over Europe, between the Ted

Heath era and that of David Cameron. It is representative, too, of the more

sceptical mood of the public, judging by the opinion polls. But it goes

completely against Mr Cameron's optimism that he can negotiate a new

relationship with the EU and win a referendum to endorse that view - and Lord

Lawson knows this very well. The former chancellor has therefore chosen his time

with malice aforethought, in order to make life much harder for the prime

minister.



Lord Lawson's move is also a reminder that, for all his occasional brilliance,

he sometimes calls big things wrong. It was he who encouraged sterling to shadow

the Deutschmark so that the UK could join the European fixed exchange rate

system - only for the ejection of the UK from that system in 1992 to seal the

Tory party's fate for a generation. It is he who, in increasingly dismissive

terms, has become this country's leading climate change denier - a stance that

has given a more general permission to the Tory party to back off from the

scientific approach to which Lady Thatcher, no less, first led it. And it is he

who, only 18 months ago, wrote that the eurozone needed time and the EU needed

reform to get themselves through their crises - yet it is he who has now

abandoned the patient approach and who is prejudging the whole outcome.



Lord Lawson is not just wrong about the underlying issue of Britain and Europe.

He is also wrong even from his own party's point of view. His move is doomed to

make life more difficult for both Mr Cameron and for the Tory party - and thus

to make it much harder for the Tories to win the 2015 election and be able to

hold the referendum which the prime minister promised in his speech in January

and on which so much is now staked.



The Tory party has been spooked by Ukip's successes in the local elections. Many

Tories wish their party embraced Ukip's signature policy of EU withdrawal. They

draw the false conclusion that a more strongly Eurosceptic stance will reduce

the Ukip threat, which, they reason, would allow the Tories to recapture their

popularity and a majority in 2015. In fact, Lord Lawson's move means the reverse

is more likely to be true - as the polls also suggested after Mr Cameron's

January speech. The more that the Tories show themselves obsessed with Europe,

which is not the main issue facing this country, the more they appear out of

touch with public concerns and the more their divisions give voters permission

to look elsewhere, including, ironically, to Ukip.



All this forms an unimpressive political backdrop to the new parliamentary

session today. In the last full session before the 2015 general election

overshadows everything, the government ought to be focused on the public's

priorities, not on those of the Tory party. Instead, the Tory part of the

coalition seems to have got everything the wrong way around. It is therefore a

moment of opportunity not for the Tories, but for their political opponents.

'Game-changer' Lawson's call to leave EU stirs Tory MPs



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 13



LENGTH: 376 words





A senior Eurosceptic Tory has warned No 10 that some MPs may defect to Ukip if

David Cameron fails to deliver a referendum on Britain's EU membership before

the next general election.



Bernard Jenkin, the former shadow defence secretary, called on the prime

minister to accelerate his plans to hold a referendum because no vote will be

held if a Lib-Lab pact is formed in 2015, a moment he described as the

"endgame".



The warning by Jenkin shows that anti-EU Tory MPs have been emboldened after

Lord Lawson, the longest serving chancellor in Margaret Thatcher's government,

called for an EU exit. One MP said the intervention by Lawson - pictured above

with Thatcher in 1985 - in yesterday's Times was a "game-changing" moment that

gave respectability to Ukip.



Jenkin said Lawson's remarks highlighted the need for a referendum within the

next two years. Cameron, who has pledged to hold a referendum by 2017 if he wins

the next election, wrote to his MPs yesterday to say he could not legislate for

a referendum this parliament because the Liberal Democrats are currently opposed

to the move.



But No 10 sources have said the prime minister might be prepared to support a

backbench private member's bill in the new session of parliament, which opens

today, that would allow a referendum before the election. Jenkin said the prime

minister needed to act fast.



Asked on Channel 4 News if there might be parliamentary defections to Ukip if no

referendum was held, Jenkin said: "It is a very good question to ask. At the

moment the Conservative party is losing support to Ukip. There are people

defecting to Ukip. I think the Conservative party becomes increasingly difficult

to manage."



Asked again if it was possible there would be defections if Cameron failed to

deliver a referendum this parliament, Jenkin said: "Of course it is a

possibility . . . we're witnessing something of a political earthquake."



It is understood that Jenkin was not signalling that he or other senior figures

would defect.



One MP said: "The Lawson intervention is transformational, a potentially

game-changing moment . . . Conservatives who want to leave the EU, but who have

been nervous about saying so, will now feel less worried about saying that."

Queen's speech: a fresh start that won't upset the backbenchers: Analysis: The

political year ahead will not be shaped today - but there are at least two

landmark reforms



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour Political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 13



LENGTH: 1117 words





Each year, the Queen's speech, often delivered in the wake of a local election

drubbing for the governing party, is presented as the moment of a political

fightback. It is the start of a new political year, and the government's

instinct is to claim this as a turning point. Downing Street's aim is to impose

coherence on what is necessarily an arbitrary collection of bills that have

fought their way to the front of the legislative queue.



But two things are notable about today's Queen's speech. Cameron has jettisoned

anything that might worsen his relationship with his backbenchers - plain

cigarette packaging, a draconian "snooper's charter", a recall bill setting out

the circumstances in which the electorate can demand miscreant MPs be recalled,

and guarantees on overseas aid spending. Secondly, the next year in Westminster,

with the exception of one bill on immigration, will not be shaped by this mass

of legislation. The real political battles lie in the June spending review, the

pace of the UK and global economic recovery, and possibly the state of the EU

debate in the Tory party.



That is not to dismiss this Queen's speech. The gaze of a government entering

its fourth year is normally solely on the coming election. Its legislative

programme in what is normally its final year reads largely like a party

manifesto. But partly due to the existence of a fixed five-year parliament, and

the fact of the coalition, this Queen's speech does contain at least two reforms

- on social care and the future of pensions - that will be remembered by

generations to come.



Social care This is the coalition blueprint for the future of social care for

older and disabled people and their carers. It will introduce a national

eligibility threshold ensuring that the social care system will be based on need

rather than postcode. The elderly will also keep care packages if they move.

Significantly, it will introduce a cap on how much people have to contribute

towards their care costs - expected to be about £72,000. The legislation will

also have to define the boundary between free NHS care and means-tested adult

social care.



Pensions The government's plans to bring in a flat-rate state pension in April

2016 will scrap the existing basic and second state pension, and replace them

with a single tier pension worth up to £144 a week in today's terms. The pension

will be earned by individuals, and its introduction will put an end to the

married person's pension, and a rule which has allowed spouses of UK pensioners

to claim up to £66 a week even if they have never paid any national insurance

contributions.



Immigration New curbs on access for recent migrants to public services,

including housing, and a much-trailed move to step up the deportation of foreign

criminals form the centrepiece of Theresa May's flagship immigration legislation

to counter the Ukip surge. Ministers are still considering whether it is

possible to introduce wide-ranging curbs on access to benefits and public

services for new migrants without a legal clash with the EU's freedom of

movement directive. The measures agreed so far include a duty on all landlords

to make sure tenants are in the UK legally. Also on the table is a possible two-

to five-year residency test for new council and housing association tenants.



Crime and antisocial behaviour This jamboree bill will include a wide range of

Home Office measures from giving victims of antisocial behaviour a say in the

punishment of the offender to introducing a new crackdown on dangerous dogs that

attack people, such as postal workers, on their owner's property. The bill was

expected to include the major measures to track internet and mobile phone use

and to introduce a minimum price for alcohol but both have been shelved as a

result of rows in the coalition. The result is that the Home Office will use the

legislation to enact a series of minor measures it has been consulting on,

including changes to police pay review arrangements and to crime data. One

potential flashpoint is the possible inclusion of powers to make police officers

redundant but a decision has been postponed on this issue.



Offender rehabilitation The next stage of the "rehabilitation revolution" will

open up 70% of probation work to privatisation, with the public probation

service restricted to supervising high-risk offenders and public protection

work. The contracts will be on a "payment by results" basis with a greater

emphasis on the use of ex-offenders as mentors.



HS2 It will be full steam ahead for the £33bn high-speed rail project, with two

bills expected. A hybrid bill will seek planning approval for the first leg of

the line from London to Birmingham, while a paving bill will fund preparatory

work for branches to Leeds and Manchester.



Consumer rights The bill aims to simplify and clarify existing consumer rights

by pulling together eight separate pieces of legislation, and updates the law to

take account of "the modern marketplace" - for example, downloading music and

films online. The bill covers goods, services, digital content and unfair

contract terms. It has been described as the first major review of consumer law

since the 1970s.



Banking reform This will implement the recommendations made by Sir John Vickers'

independent commission on banking. Banks' retail operations will be ringfenced

from investment banking operations and the government gets powers to break up

firms which do not do this correctly. Depositors will be better protected, with

those covered by the financial services compensation scheme becoming

preferential creditors if a bank goes bust.



Local audit bill Disbands the Audit Commission and transfers its inhouse local

authority auditing practice to the private sector, allowing local bodies to

appoint their own auditors.



Others Four bills - energy, gay marriage, banking reform and children and

families - were introduced in the previous session and will be carried over.

They have yet to have a second reading in the Lords. Also: a mesothelioma bill

covering the issue of missing employers' liability insurance; a national

insurance contributions bill cutting the cost of recruiting new employees for

small employers, taking 450,000 out of paying employer NICs altogether; a

deregulation bill reducing red tape; and a bill encouraging more mutuals.



Europe? Ministers will wait to see if a eurosceptic backbencher wins a prime

spot in the ballot for private members' bills and uses it to advance an EU

membership referendum bill. Nothing at this stage seems likely to reach the

statute book this side of an election.

Former chancellor says it is time to quit the EU: Lawson claims it is time for

Britain to leave union Remarks will fuel the Tory party's Eurosceptic mood



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour Political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 529 words





Opponents of British membership of the European Union yesterday gained their

most prestigious recruit when the former chancellor Lord Lawson claimed the

British economy would be better off outside the EU.



Lawson said the profoundly misguided aim of the EU was to create a federal

European superstate - a United States of Europe - and concluded "that is not for

us". The EU, he said, has passed its sell-by date and has become "a bureaucratic

monstrosity" from which the UK should break free. After an association with

Brussels of 40 years, he said, "the case for exit is clear".



In an article in the Times, Lawson writes that as a result he would vote for the

UK to leave the EU if, as he hopes, the issue is put to the British people in a

referendum in 2017. Lawson, who was chancellor from 1983 to 1989 under the

leadership of Margaret Thatcher, has previously said any renegotiation with the

UK's EU partners would fail.



His latest remarks will embolden the growing Eurosceptic mood in the

Conservative party in the wake of last week's impressive county council election

showing by Ukip. It puts pressure on David Cameron to advance legislation on a

referendum on UK membership of the EU in this parliament, and even to hint he

will oppose continuing British membership unless he gains substantial

concessions in the talks he is planning with his European colleagues. Lawson

suggest Cameron will win no substantial reforms.



While it was "by no means assured" that Cameron would win the 2015 general

election, Lawson said he believed public demand was such that a referendum would

have to happen under Labour in any case. Dismissing the chances of either party

securing significant reforms, he said Brussels would fear a "general

unravelling" as other countries sought to match the return of powers.



"The heart of the matter is that the very nature of the European Union, and of

this country's relationship with it, has fundamentally changed after the coming

into being of the European monetary union and the creation of the eurozone, of

which - quite rightly - we are not a part.



"That is why, while I voted 'in' in 1975, I shall be voting 'out' in 2017," he

writes.



Lawson remains a respected figure in Tory circles and is seen as the great

reforming chancellor under Thatcher.



He insists there would be advantages in the UK leaving the EU. He writes: "You

do not need to be within the single market to be able to export to the European

Union, as we see from the wide range of goods on our shelves every day.



"The heart of the matter is that the relevant economic context nowadays is not

Europe but globalisation, including global free trade, with the World Trade

Organisation as its monitor."



"Too much of British business and industry feels similarly secure in the warm

embrace of the European single market and is failing to recognise that today's

great export opportunities lie in the developing world, particularly in Asia.



"Just as entry into the Common Market half a century ago provided a much-needed

change of focus, so might leaving the EU, an institution that has achieved its

historic purpose and is now past its sell-by date, provide a much-needed change

of focus today."

Comment: If Boris is the answer, you're asking the wrong question: Cameron and

his A-list have alienated swaths of voters. Until they understand how, Ukip will

be the beneficiary



BYLINE: John Harris



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 24



LENGTH: 955 words





Don't panic: a nice bit of policy will sort Ukip out. The Tory right urges not

one EU referendum but two. Those close to government emphasise moves on prison

"perks", and items in this week's Queen's speech that will deal with immigrants'

access to benefits and the NHS. Meanwhile, pundits and politicians from all

sides claim that Nigel Farage's grab-bag of proposals will fall apart under

close scrutiny, and the menace will recede.



Well, maybe. Real politics is built on emotion and tribal affinity rather than

policy - and on this score, Ukip excels. So full of chutzpah and mischief that

he is talking about Ukip-Tory pacts, Farage knows the people for whom his party

now speaks: English conservatives, with both a small and large "C",

disproportionately found in the south-eastern working class (quite an

achievement for a son of a stockbroker, alumnus of Dulwich College and former

banker). If you think the country has lost its way thanks to a cosseted

political class, that immigration and so-called welfare are at the heart of the

problem, and that the Tories have little understanding of life as it actually

lived, then you may well have voted Ukip as matter of visceral instinct.



Last week, I spent time with Ukip in Essex. At least half were ex-Tories, from

decidedly non-posh backgrounds. I spoke to a few of their voters, too. At first,

it was strange having so many conversations with people convinced that the

Conservatives had lost their way: what, I wondered, of the government's benefits

crackdown, or their clear wish to shrink the state? But in such towns as

Wickford, Billericay and Rayleigh, the disaffection runs much deeper than that.



The Conservatives have frayed their bond with what one pundit has called "Tebbit

Tories", who look at David Cameron and George Osborne and see a grim cultural

hybrid, alienating beyond words: public-school conceit mixed with the kind of

metropolitan smarminess that Tony Blair stretched to snapping point. Worse

still, the Tory elite's distance from the nitty gritty is reflected in their

lack of any firm offer to so many of their own voters - what does the modern

Conservative party think it can do for them?



There are plenty of occasions when the absurdity of the Tories' predicament is

revealed. When, for instance, Osborne popped up at a branch of Morrisons

affecting a glottal stop and explaining the downsides of the benefits system

("Briddish people badly wannit fixed," as one Telegraph writer translated it),

did he have any idea how awful it looked to the people he was trying to reach?

Even if the Tories' politics and economics remain essentially Thatcherite, given

the backgrounds - if not the entire worldview - of the current leadership, the

medium cancels out the message.



"We have to break this impression of being privileged and out of touch," said

that working-class Tory David Davis over the weekend, doubtless aware that a

good way of showing how annoyed you are is to demand the impossible.



If you appreciate the old political brilliance the Tories have so mislaid, you

will understand why some view all this as a mounting tragedy. We are talking

about the party that wised up to the end of deference by collectively

acknowledging that the era of grouse moors was drawing to a close, and placed

millions of ordinary Britons at the heart of its most successful phase - partly

thanks to the sale of council houses, the kind of populist masterstroke that the

Cameroons can only dream about. If you read the best histories of the 1980s,

it's all there: in One of Us, Hugo Young quotes Norman Tebbit paying tribute to

people "who want to own things, make choices, live decently", and describes how

the Thatcherites' "patchy economic record" could always be trumped by "an

attitude - the attitude Thatcher herself could trace directly back to Grantham".



Where is that attitude now? A couple of cabinet members - Eric Pickles, and the

transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin - still personify it, but they are

hardly at the heart of things.



Those who still admire Cameron would argue that the red-raw Conservatism that

Ukip voice will only attract an insufficient share of an electorate becoming

more urban, liberal and socially diverse. To which the answer is: this is as

much about style as substance, and the fact that if you want to bang on about

hard work, aspiration and opportunity, it might be an idea to find people with

experience of what they actually mean. In other words, even if some degree of

"modernisation" was imperative, was it the wisest move to select a public-school

clique to do it?



All this seems to be haunting the Tory soul, but note some other developments.

Among Cameron's recent moves has been the recruitment to policy roles of the

Etonian MPs Jesse Norman (last heard putting the chumocracy down to his old

school's "commitment to public service") and Jo Johnson. And even among those

who recognise the Tory malaise, there is that incessant chorus claiming that the

best way to cure the Tories' ills is to hand the leadership to the latter's big

brother Boris.



That Old Etonian has assets Cameron and Osborne lack: human warmth, the ability

to give the appearance of straight-taking, a Farage-ish personal brand, and - oh

yes - an ability to win elections. He is stitched into the new establishment,

while giving the impression he is some kind of maverick. Farage has been making

appreciative noises about him; if the Tories' difficulties worsen, the banal

idea that he is the answer may gain currency. If it does, I would prescribe a

simple course of action: any tempted Conservatives should spend a few days

outside London, understand the profundity of their problems, and give it a

little bit more thought.

When Nigel met Nigel: Ukip is 'here to stay' says Farage



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 288 words





The United Kingdom Independence party will trigger a political "earthquake" in

next year's European parliamentary elections, its leader, Nigel Farage, said

yesterday.



Amid growing calls from Tory MPs for David Cameron to respond to the Ukip threat

by bringing forward legislation on an EU referendum, Farage warned that his

party would not go away even if No 10 "starts singing the same song".



William Hague, who famously suffered a major defeat in the 2001 election after

tacking to the right, called for a cautious response to Ukip as he warned of the

dangers of "quick fixes".



Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, said many Ukip voters were "frustrated

Conservatives".



As the Tories work out their response to Ukip, which won nearly a quarter of the

vote in wards it contested in the local elections, Farage said he would not be

standing in any byelection over the next year as he focuses on the European

parliamentary elections.



The Ukip leader told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: "Ukip is here to stay . . .

June 2014 we have a European election. That is the day on which Ukip can cause

an earthquake in British politics. I want to lead the party into that."



Asked whether he would stand for parliament in the 2015 general election, Farage

said: "Yes I will stand for a seat in 2015. I have been rather busy for the last

few weeks doing other things (to decide which seat to contest). But I will think

about it."



Farage pointed out that Ukip was picking up votes not just from the Tories. He

added: "Please don't think that Ukip is just some little pressure group that

will go away because somebody in Downing Street starts singing the same song."

When Nigel met Nigel: Farage stokes Tory tensions



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 301 words





William Hague was at loggerheads with old allies on the Tory right last night

after he rejected calls for a change in tactics by Downing Street as a response

to the new threat posed by the United Kingdom Independence party.



As the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, warned that his party would trigger a

political "earthquake" in next year's European parliamentary elections, the

foreign secretary dismissed calls for an immediate EU referendum and said there

were no "quick fixes".



There were suggestions last night that Downing Street may try to reach out to

disaffected Tory voters, who have complained about plans to legalise gay

marriage, by omitting any reference to the equal marriage bill in this week's

Queen's speech.



The Liberal Democrats say the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill will not and

cannot be dropped.



But one leading figure on the right accused Hague of failing to understand the

depth of the threat posed by Ukip whose success is not a "flash in the pan". The

senior MP said: "William Hague is once again proving that he is always wrong on

strategy."



Farage stoked Tory tensions by saying that he would be open to talks if the

party removed Cameron as prime minister.



The Ukip leader told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: "If David Cameron gets

removed . . . and somebody else was put in place who wanted to come and talk to

us and say, 'Shall we find an accommodation?' we would consider it. But it is

not my priority."



David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, called on Cameron to speed up the

process of a vote on the EU by holding a "mandate" referendum.



But Hague said it was not possible to introduce a government bill, although he

held out the possibility of the Tory leadership supporting a backbench bill.

Leading article: LOCAL ELECTIONS: Ukip surge gives all parties cause for concern



SECTION: OBSERVER NEW COMMENT PAGES; Pg. 38



LENGTH: 1104 words





On Friday, Nigel Farage, the leader of Ukip, grinned broadly as he celebrated

what he called the birth of a new era of four-party politics. His party took a

quarter of the national vote in the county council elections and has done well

in the Eastleigh and South Shields byelections. Farage believes the results will

have a seismic impact on the political elite. "The establishment has been

shocked and stunned," he said with relish. Last week, it was the Tory shires

that bore the brunt; next year, Labour's city councils may be under threat and

the prediction is that Ukip will reign supreme in the European elections. No

wonder Nigel is smiling. All three party leaders have profound cause for

concern. Whether Ukip's attraction is temporary or longer lasting and robust

enough to suck up votes in the 2015 general election, mainstream politics has

been called to account and found seriously wanting.



David Cameron has responded speedily. He is reported to have promised to back a

private members' bill (to circumvent Lib-Dem opposition) in the next session of

parliament to ensure that a referendum on EU membership is held after the next

general election. He has also said that the Queen's speech on Wednesday will

address welfare and immigration, ahead of the lifting of transnational controls

on citizens from Romania and Bulgaria next year. Announcements on prison

conditions and welfare changes in recent months have signalled a shift to the

right but some Tory backbenchers, out of sorts with Cameron's modernisation

agenda highlighting issues such as gay marriage, are demanding far more. If a

Conservative party won't deliver Conservative policies then Ukip is the answer,

they opine. However, moving to the right might woo lost Tory votes but since it

is the centre that wins general elections, Cameron risks winning a battle while

losing the war.



In contrast, the outlook for the Lib Dems at Westminster, at least, is not as

bleak as it appeared to be just a few months ago. Two-thirds of its MPs are in

constituencies in which the Tories came second. In present circumstances, Ukip

will split this vote, giving the Lib Dems some security and perhaps encouraging

the prospect of a Lib Dem-Lab coalition. Nick Clegg's party no longer attracts

the protest vote, but it is likely to retain its foothold in parliament and

power. As Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, notoriously said, his members are

like "cockroaches". Once in the House, they are notoriously difficult to remove.



The impact of Ukip on Labour's electoral chances, however, may not be nearly so

benign. The Ukip surge is a warning. Immediate analysis indicates that two

groups, in the main, have been swayed by Farage. They are the less qualified,

working-class, older male and the lower middle class who are very squeezed

indeed. Traditionally, the former group would have voted Labour. Since the

1980s, according to Ben Page of Ipsos-Mori, that allegiance has been under

pressure, opening up a fissure, which Ukip can easily widen, threatening Labour

seats in its heartlands. So what is Labour to do?



It needs urgently to address the profound democratic disconnection that Ukip's

success has exposed - a disconnection that is a major challenge for all three

main parties. Ukip's rise undoubtedly has much to do with Farage himself. Public

school-educated, time in the City, affluent and affable, he, like Boris, has

turned being "off message" into an electoral asset. For many, he has

authenticity because he appears a man of the people.



Farage's common touch has an impact on Ed Miliband too. He has embarked on a

brave and much needed enterprise - to build a fairer social contract that

responds to concerns about immigration and delivers growth and prosperity for

all. The mechanics of how such a contract is constructed and costed is one

issue; another is Miliband's need to develop a more populist touch.



Another example of the disconnect in action is the dismissal by many politicians

and commentators of Ukip's rise as the consequence of a temporary protest vote.

For many voters, the party's policies matter a great deal, albeit a number are

already becoming unstitched. The immigration cap of 50,000 a year is under

revision, for instance. But on other issues, Farage is clear about his goals, if

not about the means to achieve them. He has said he will oversee the UK's

withdrawal from the EU, increase defence spending by 40%, install smoking rooms

in pubs, bring back grammar schools and cut taxes. The price tag is elusive.

Critics say his aim is a mythical Britain of the 1950s reclaimed.



A more constructive criticism would focus less on Ukip - its inconsistencies

will reveal themselves in due course - and more on the failings of the main

parties whose perceived arrogance has encouraged the populist right to flourish.

For years, polls have registered voters' escalating disillusionment - witnessed

again in Thursday's low turnout. They look at their own community and see

diversity, whether welcome or otherwise. They look at Westminster and see a

largely white, male, middle-class set of career politicians. Trust has

evaporated. As in Europe as a whole, the political class is deemed to have

presided over an economic disaster that threatens the livelihoods and futures of

millions. Insecurity is rife, exacerbated by the cuts.



In 2011, Joe Hayman spent three months interviewing a thousand people across the

UK and in British Voices, published last year, he captured what the surveys tell

us. Large numbers of Britons feel isolated and alienated. Voter apathy is high

while belief in the integrity and competence of politicians is low. Populist

parties across Europe range from moderate to extreme radical right, but what

they share in common, as Anthony Painter describes in a paper for the thinktank

Policy Network, is an anti-elite determination to be "brand changers", to

reshape the way democracy functions and the issues it prioritises. Ukip has

little doctrine, a jalopy of a manifesto - its powerful attraction is its "us"

against "them" ethos. Unless Labour, Lib Dem and Conservatives respond to the

warnings, Farage will be moulding their futures.



Something fundamental is at stake. Farage's stated aim is to move politics

significantly to the right but retain Ukip's identity as the true voice of the

centre ground: a potentially harmful strategy for sound civic health. It is

imperative that the three main parties work to find credible, just and

innovative ways to reconnect parliament and the people.



"We get it," Tory chairman Grant Shapps said following Thursday's vote. Ukip is

right to believe that, as yet, they don't.

Comment: David Cameron won't prosper by trying to outkip the Kippers: Both the

Tories and Labour have several reasons to be troubled by the Ukip surge - and

one to be grateful for it



BYLINE: Andrew Rawnsley



SECTION: OBSERVER NEW COMMENT PAGES; Pg. 39



LENGTH: 1507 words





Depending on who has been speaking, and their taste in hyperbolic metaphors, the

surge to Ukip is either a "sea change" in British politics or it is a "seismic

event".



To which I say: take a cold shower and calm down. Nigel Farage is understandably

elated - and the established parties are naturally stunned - by Ukip's

performance in the county council elections, but it is deserving of neither

comparisons with earthquakes nor quotes from Shakespeare. A sea change is what

happened when Jim Callaghan was booted out by Margaret Thatcher at the general

election of 1979 to usher in 18 years of Conservative rule. A seismic event is

what occurred when Tony Blair won the general election of 1997 by the largest

parliamentary landslide in modern history. On Thursday, Ukip won just shy of a

quarter of the votes in local government elections mainly confined to the shires

of England, in which a third of the potential electorate turned out. That is

clearly noteworthy, but it is extremely premature to start jabbering that this

is a historic turning point.



No doubt Ukip's leader would retort that this is typical of the condescension

that his party has received from those who dwell inside the "Westminster

bubble". Actually, I've never dismissed them. I forecast many months ago that

they were very likely to top the poll in next year's Euro-elections, a

prediction that then looked a bit bold, but is now hardening into a consensus

expectation. I fully expected the Farageists to do very well in these county

contests. My point is that there is a very important difference between a local

election upset, even a big one, and events that recast the political landscape

forever.



Several forces are at work, some fairly particular to this moment, some more

deep-seated, which have been powering Mr Farage's gang. One is the desire of a

section of the electorate to thrust an angry two fingers up at the entire

political establishment. That urge is especially intense when a government is at

midterm, there is a tight squeeze on living standards and there is no great

enthusiasm for the principal party of conventional opposition. The beneficiaries

in the past were usually the Lib Dems and sometimes other parties, such as the

BNP and the Greens and Ukip itself, which did very well at the Euro-elections of

2004 and 2009 only to fizzle out by the time of the general elections a year

later. Since the Lib Dems made the transition from party of protest to party of

government, that vote has been in need of a new way of expressing itself.



Before Thursday, Mr Farage seemed generally content to accept the idea that his

party was principally a party of protest, suggesting his main aim was not to win

parliamentary seats but to draw the other parties, especially the Tories, on to

his agenda. In the wake of the results, he has been emboldened to claim they are

an endorsement of his party's "positive policy solutions".



I don't think so, Nigel. I have a hunch that Ukip did not attract support

because of its plans for the health service or its industrial strategy.

Actually, it is more than a hunch. Polling of Ukip voters by YouGov finds that

less than 10% of them back the party because they think it "would run the

country well" and more than 60% say a main reason to support Ukip is because

they are "unhappy with the major parties" or want to "send a message".



The arrival of four-party politics in England, something the Welsh and the Scots

have been used to for more than a generation, certainly poses big challenges for

those established parties. Ukip voters are not coming only from the Tories, but

their principal effect is to split the vote on the right. The Conservatives, who

did such a good job of persuading people to reject electoral reform in the

referendum two years ago, may live to regret not embracing the alternative vote.



The Tories are more confused and divided than ever about how to respond. They

have tried attacking Ukip, but labelling them as "clowns", even if often true,

only seems to enhance their appeal as an anti-establishment party. The new Tory

line, scripted from the top, is to be polite. So they are now fruitcakes whom

the prime minister "respects".



The right of his party are predictably clamouring for David Cameron to get into

an auction for Ukip voters. Here they go again. Be tougher on immigration. Slash

even deeper at welfare. Scrap gay marriage. Harden up or advance the pledge to

hold a referendum on membership of the European Union. They clearly did not

notice that chasing after Ukip voters is exactly what the Tories did during the

local election campaign. There was the clumsy announcement of the termination of

international aid to South Africa, noises about toughening up prison regimes and

cracking down harder on welfare and immigration, and suggestions of firming up

the pledge on a EU referendum - all moves designed to woo the Ukip-inclined. The

Tories tried the same at the Eastleigh byelection and it didn't work then

either. As I've remarked before, you can't outkip the Kippers. If Mr Cameron

succumbs to the internal pressure to move right, he risks further diminishing

the appeal of the Tory party to the centrist voters without whom he cannot

possibly hope to win a general election in 2015.



The better Tory strategy would be to focus on the fact that Nigel Farage is not

going to become prime minister. This won't stop him demanding a place in any

televised leaders' debate, but I would wager as many pints as he can drink

between now and May 2015 that he is not going to be kissing hands with the

Queen. The majority of Ukip voters tell pollsters that the Conservatives are

their second-choice party. That gives Tories reasonable grounds to hope that

many can be won back at a general election, when they will present the choice as

a binary one between David Cameron and Ed Miliband. There is only one problem

with this strategy. It requires the Tories to keep their heads and holding their

nerve is something they find hard to do for two minutes, never mind two years.



In terms of what they indicate about political enthusiasm and momentum, these

elections are also troubling for Labour. Ed Miliband's people can point to some

encouraging performances in key battleground areas in southern England such as

Harlow in Essex and Hastings in Sussex. But Labour's overall performance was

underwhelming. While most obviously a threat to the Tories, Ukip is also

attracting support from less affluent, traditionally Labour voters. What ought

to worry Ed Miliband a lot is that these "squeezed middle" voters are precisely

the people whom he has been targeting for nearly three years now. A significant

slice of them prefer Mr Farage's beer-swilling, right-wing populism to the

Labour leader's theorising about a new paradigm of capitalism. Sticking the

Labour leader on a pop-up soap box - it is actually a pallet - has not solved

the problem. A lesson for Labour to learn from the Ukip leader is that it is

essential to translate ideas and policy into accessible language that can be

sold on the doorstep.



It is for the Lib Dems that these results have the most paradoxical

implications. They lost another slew of councillors and were humiliated at the

South Shields byelection, coming in seventh, only just ahead of the Monster

Raving Loonies. Yet in terms of the larger picture, there are a few glimmers of

encouragement for Nick Clegg's party. They did better in areas where they hold

parliamentary seats. Neither the Tories nor Labour show a convincing capacity to

mobilise enough voters behind them to justify any confidence that they can win a

parliamentary majority. That is a strong pointer towards the next general

election producing another hung parliament.



The big challenge for all the established parties is how to deal with the

"anti-politics" mood that Ukip is feeding off, the resentment felt by many

voters that Britain is run in their own interests and those of their friends by

a lookalike metropolitan elite who are all implicated in the economic mess. It

is quite amusing that this vote should flow to Ukip. Its leader is a very

well-paid MEP, who is never backward in putting in for his expenses, the son of

a stockbroker who went to private school, used to trade commodities and likes to

prance around in a green Barbour and a fedora. Ukip's treasurer, Stuart Wheeler,

is a multimillionaire old Etonian who lives in a Jacobean castle. These are

rather unlikely characters to be the tribunes of the people against the

political class that Ukip claims to despise.



Ukip may be inhabited by oddballs, the unsavoury and worse, but there is one

sense in which the mainstream parties should be grateful to this particularly

English way of protesting. Across Europe, austerity is fuelling a revolt against

the political establishment that is manifesting itself in surges of support for

the hard left or the far right - parties such as Marine Le Pen's Front National

in France and the fascist Golden Dawn in Greece. We will have done well if Ukip

is as ugly as it ever gets here.

When Nigel Farage needs a break he heads out to sea. On Saturday, after 24 hours

of wall-to-wall media appearances he drove to the south coast and went fishing

in the Channel with friends. It was the only place he could be sure of being out

of mobile phone contact.



"I turn the bugger off," he told the Observer. "It clears the head. When I am

out there I don't think about anything except what bait to use, what lure to use

and why some other bloke is catching more than me."



Farage was briefly cutting himself adrift from politics after his party, Ukip,

had stirred up the waters as never before by securing a stunning 23% of the vote

in Thursday's local elections. Farage had predicted that Ukip would take at

least 14% a couple of weeks ago, which many had thought was wildly optimistic.



But it exceeded his wildest dreams, increasing its number of council seats from

eight to 147 overnight, eating into the Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrat

support across the country. For the first time ever, none of the mainstream

parties took more than the 30% of the vote. Labour secured 29%, the Tories 25%

and the Lib Dems 14%. Nothing like it had happened before.



Up until this weekend experts had doubted Ukip's ability to establish itself as

more than a protest party, and believed that it would fade at the 2015 general

election, as it had in 2010. But those experts are changing their tune.



Tony Travers, of the London School of Economics, said: "I am normally cautious

but I do think the tectonic plates are shifting. The share of the vote of the

main two parties has been declining since the 1950s. But it is now even lower

than it was at the height of the scandal over MPs expenses in 2009. You can half

imagine David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg having to have a meeting to

think what to do as Ukip is hurting them all."



On Thursday afternoon, when voting was still under way, a Ukip official rang

Radio 4's Today programme asking if it wanted Farage on the show the next

morning and was given a noncommittal response. At 5.55am on Friday, as it was

clear Ukip was making big inroads, Today rang back to book Farage in for a prime

slot.



"They had woken up to the fact that we really were the story," said Gawain

Towler, Farage's spokesman.



So what, for the man at the centre of it all, had been the biggest lesson?

"Simple. It is that the rest of them don't speak the same language as normal

people," he said. "They can't connect with people out there. The change that has

happened to people's lives from immigration is extraordinary, but the other

parties have nothing to say about it. They make vague promises and don't

deliver."



The Ukip leader may have been a member of the European parliament since 1999 but

he loves to present himself as cut off from the "political class", or what he

often refers to as "the establishment elite". In one of his BBC TV appearances

on Friday afternoon Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, asked how

many seats Farage thought Ukip would win at the next general election. "I have

no idea," Farage barked back with something between a grin and a scowl. "I am

not a professional politician like you."



This is the nightmare facing the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems. Farage is

breaking the mould not just by speaking about the need to withdraw from the EU

but by not being one of them. He is the bloke talking common sense on the

street, the fellow who goes fishing on his day off.



Towler noted the terror written on the faces of his Tory, Labour and Lib Dem

opponents throughout Friday: "What you saw was a recognition from the other

parties that we have to deal with these buggers, but they have not the faintest

idea how to do it. Nigel does not fit with their game, their way of doing

things. He is different. He doesn't do focus groups."



Yesterday on the streets of Huntingdon, where Ukip's surge had deprived the

Tories of control of Cambridgeshire council, people spoke well of Farage, who

visited the town two weeks ago. "You don't see many people wearing yellow

corduroy trousers and tweed jackets around here," said Graham Tibbitt, 60. "He's

a breath of fresh air. I voted Ukip. He's better than the usual stodgy men in

suits."



This weekend, whatever Farage's desire to position himself as an outsider, Ukip

has landed at the heart of British politics. His party may still have no seats

at Westminster but it is a big step nearer getting one. It is confident of

emerging with the largest share of the votes at next year's European elections,

a result that would cause even deeper trauma inside the Tory party than it is

experiencing now. Farage will then stand at the 2015 election.



He is demanding the right to appear alongside Cameron, Miliband and Clegg in

pre-election TV debates - something that could persuade Cameron to ditch them

altogether, leaving himself open to charges of cowardice. Like the Lib Dems have

done since the 1980s, Ukip is putting down roots in local government and it is

the first stage on a journey.



"What I have always said is that if we establish a bridgehead in the county

councils we can have a serious tilt at winning a Westminster seat," explained

Farage. "We have done that now."



Ukip's rise under Farage is not a lone phenomenon in the EU, though that will be

of little comfort to the mainstream parties. Populist politicians are on the

rise all over Europe as people have seen leaders and institutions, domestic and

European, unable to deal with the economic crisis.



Disillusion has mixed lethally with a sense of dislocation from power. Faith in

remote institutions has been eroded as insecurity has grown. New parties

unconnected with the establishment have cashed in. In Italy this year, Beppe

Grillo's Five Star Movement scored more than 25% in the national election and is

the country's single largest party.



In Greece, Alexis Tsipras, leader of the Greek leftwing movement, is polling at

20%. In France last year, Marine Le Pen scored 18% in the presidential election

and is now powering ahead against Francois Hollande, while in the Netherlands

Geert Wilders' Freedom party is polling at 15%.



Jamie Bartlett, of the thinktank Demos, who has studied populist movements in

the EU, talks of "declining trust in the way politics is done, and a feeling

that the institutions that govern our lives don't represent us any more. People

want someone who seems authentic, ordinary, like them."



Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, said the combination

of economic crisis and bad governance by EU leaders had created the ideal

climate in which populism could grow. He said: "We have a weak economy, weak

leadership and a very badly run EU. It would be very surprising if there were

not these populist movements growing up."



So how to stop Farage? Do the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems react or just sit back

and hope that a party with few developed policies beyond getting out of the EU

and barring more Romanians and Bulgarians coming to this country will implode

under greater scrutiny?



Next year's European elections are now a terrifying prospect for the Tories.

Already this weekend, Tory Eurosceptics are demanding that Cameron brings

forward a referendum on Europe to May 2014. David Ruffley, the Tory MP for Bury

St Edmunds, said action from Cameron was needed now because voters had not

noticed the prime minister's previous commitment to an in-out referendum in

2017.



"The Ukip insurgency is real and it is serious," he said. "In 12 months' time,

at the European elections, we will have another dose of this. We must act now."



Ruffley, like other Tories, including former leadership candidate David Davis

and former cabinet minister John Redwood, wants Cameron to push a bill through

parliament for a "mandate" referendum, to be held on the same day as the

European poll, which will ask people whether they want to empower Cameron to go

to Brussels and demand powers back from the EU over everything from policing, to

employment, the EU budget and immigration. It would show he means it, they say.



Already the Tories, under the management of their new Australian strategist

Lynton Crosby, are moving right and ditching policies unpopular with the party.

In a major U-turn they have decided not to legislate to bind future governments

to commit at least 0.7% of GNP to international aid, despite repeated pledges to

do so. The dilemma for Cameron is how far he can go to the right without being

seen to abandon the centre ground.



For Labour and the Lib Dems, too, Ukip poses profound questions. If the Tories

commit to a referendum sooner than currently envisaged, can Miliband or Clegg

risk going into the next election without shifting to a much more Eurosceptic

position well before then? This weekend both parties insist that they will not

be swayed by Ukip and will stand firm with existing policies.



"I think what we need is not to obsess about Europe for the next year, but to

focus on what people really care about, which is living standards," said a Lib

Dem official.



Farage, meanwhile, is enjoying looking on at the panic and havoc he is causing.

"They're all trying to protect their seats but that is not what bothers me," he

said in another jibe at the political class he pretends not to be a part of. "I

just came into politics to make a change."

WHAT SHOULD THE PARTIES DO?



THE TORIES



Fraser Nelson, editor, the Spectator



The Tories must realise that Ukip is morphing into a working-class party and

respond by coming up with their own message. I recently sneaked into the back of

a Ukip rally in the Midlands, half-expecting to find Farage blowing

anti-immigrant dog-whistles to the kind of audience that the BNP was attracting

in its heyday. Instead Farage said he welcomed immigrants of any creed or colour

as long as they were skilled. He was cheered by the type of people you once

found at Tory conferences. Ukip's appeal lies in its relevance to the concerns

of voters - the people in places such as Boston, now a Ukip town. He realises

that politics is not a Westminster parlour game played by PPE graduates. Ukip's

rise is a reminder that the size of our problems has outgrown the smallness of

our politics.



LIBERAL DEMOCRATS



Mark Pack, editor of Liberal Democrat Newswire



The anti-establishment rage may have been picked up by a rightwing party, but

wise Liberal Democrats will respond to the underlying issues - the need for a

stronger economy and a more responsive political system - rather than start

talking up rightwing stances on immigration or Europe. Some of Ukip's support

comes from places Lib Dems should leave well alone - especially those yearning

for a 50s-style society of white men at work, white women at home and gays in

the closet. The people who feel stripped of political power and facing economic

tough times are the ones the Lib Dems should look to win over. The party is able

to make progress where it listens carefully, campaigns intensively and doesn't

stop when polling day is over.



LABOUR



Rowenna Davis, below, Labour councillor in Southwark, London



The best way of dealing with Farage is to hand out copies of Ukip's manifesto.

People turn away from his grin pretty quickly when they hear he wants to lower

tax rates for the rich, outlaw gay marriage and replace maternity rights with a

return to smoking in public places. But the best way to deal with Ukip shouldn't

be Farage's manifesto - it should be Labour's. We have to win back trust on the

"difficult issues". Why didn't we have transition controls on immigration like

other EU countries? Ukip's answers might be rubbish, but the questions they

raise are legitimate.

Front: Tories call for rapid EU vote to halt Ukip surge



BYLINE: Toby Helm, Political Editor



SECTION: OBSERVER HOME NEWS PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 690 words





The extent of Tory concern over the rise of Ukip burst into the open last night

as senior Conservatives demanded two referendums on Europe - the first next

spring - in a bid to halt the rise of Nigel Farage's rampant anti-EU party.



Members of the Thatcherite No Turning Back group broke cover to call for the

two-stage referendum package, after the Conservatives suffered heavy defeats at

the hands of Ukip in Thursday's council elections.



While the Tories' loss of 335 seats was less than some party figures had feared,

Ukip's surge to 23% of the vote - just 2% behind the Tories - reinforced their

fear that Farage and his team could emerge as the largest party from next year's

European elections. Tories are increasingly concerned that, if they fail to act,

Farage could go on to inflict serious damage on their prospects of keeping

Labour out of power at the 2015 general election.



The MPs demanding an urgent response, including David Davis, the former

leadership challenger, called on David Cameron to give the public absolute

certainty about his intentions over Europe by legislating soon for an initial

"mandate" referendum, to take place next year, ahead of or at the same time as

the European elections in May.



The purpose would be to strengthen the prime minister's negotiating hand and

show the party was serious about securing a new deal for the UK in the face of

the Ukip charge.



In the first referendum, people would be asked to give Cameron authority to

renegotiate the terms of UK membership on issues such as employment policy,

co-operation over police and justice policy, and immigration. A second in/out

referendum would be held, as is planned in the next parliament, in which people

would be asked if they wanted to remain in the EU after a deal was reached with

the UK's EU partners.



Davis told the Observer that having a first referendum next year would be "an

absolute Ukip killer", as Farage would have either to back the plan or show his

inflexibility. "It would massively reinforce the prime minister's negotiating

hand and put some steel in his back," he said. "He would be more likely to

return from any negotiation with a good deal that would mean we stay in the EU."



Tory MP David Ruffley said that Cameron's previous pledge to hold an in/out

referendum in 2017 after any new treaty is negotiated had not registered with

the public, as it was too distant and vague.



"David Cameron has to have a clear, sharper message on Europe because most

people are not aware of his referendum pledge," he said.



"This would be a concrete vote showing that Conservatives are serious about

getting a referendum. It is about focusing minds. This Ukip insurgency is real

and it's serious. Twelve months from now we will have another dose of this (at

the council and European elections). We have to act now."



MPs concede it is too late to insert a bill for a first referendum into this

week's Queen's speech - which the coalition will use to highlight measures to

boost the economy, including legislation for the HS2 high-speed rail line

between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds - but say one could be

introduced within the next few months.



Such a move is bound to be resisted by the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, who say the

government should stand by existing coalition policy. A party official said: "We

should not spend the next year obsessing about Europe. We should concentrate on

what really concerns people, which is their living standards."



Home secretary Theresa May yesterday conceded that the government had to show

"greater certainty" about its intention to hold a referendum on EU membership,

but said the negotiations, which will happen after 2015, had to take place

first. She said: "If you want to take a renegotiated settlement to the British

people, you have to renegotiate it. We can look at whether we can give some

greater certainty in terms of the referendum."



She did not rule out legislation in the current parliament to pave the way for a

referendum, despite the tensions it would create with the Tories' Lib Dem

coalition partners.

Leading article: LOCAL ELECTIONS: Ukip surge gives all parties cause for concern



SECTION: OBSERVER NEW COMMENT PAGES; Pg. 38



LENGTH: 1104 words





On Friday, Nigel Farage, the leader of Ukip, grinned broadly as he celebrated

what he called the birth of a new era of four-party politics. His party took a

quarter of the national vote in the county council elections and has done well

in the Eastleigh and South Shields byelections. Farage believes the results will

have a seismic impact on the political elite. "The establishment has been

shocked and stunned," he said with relish. Last week, it was the Tory shires

that bore the brunt; next year, Labour's city councils may be under threat and

the prediction is that Ukip will reign supreme in the European elections. No

wonder Nigel is smiling. All three party leaders have profound cause for

concern. Whether Ukip's attraction is temporary or longer lasting and robust

enough to suck up votes in the 2015 general election, mainstream politics has

been called to account and found seriously wanting.



David Cameron has responded speedily. He is reported to have promised to back a

private members' bill (to circumvent Lib-Dem opposition) in the next session of

parliament to ensure that a referendum on EU membership is held after the next

general election. He has also said that the Queen's speech on Wednesday will

address welfare and immigration, ahead of the lifting of transnational controls

on citizens from Romania and Bulgaria next year. Announcements on prison

conditions and welfare changes in recent months have signalled a shift to the

right but some Tory backbenchers, out of sorts with Cameron's modernisation

agenda highlighting issues such as gay marriage, are demanding far more. If a

Conservative party won't deliver Conservative policies then Ukip is the answer,

they opine. However, moving to the right might woo lost Tory votes but since it

is the centre that wins general elections, Cameron risks winning a battle while

losing the war.



In contrast, the outlook for the Lib Dems at Westminster, at least, is not as

bleak as it appeared to be just a few months ago. Two-thirds of its MPs are in

constituencies in which the Tories came second. In present circumstances, Ukip

will split this vote, giving the Lib Dems some security and perhaps encouraging

the prospect of a Lib Dem-Lab coalition. Nick Clegg's party no longer attracts

the protest vote, but it is likely to retain its foothold in parliament and

power. As Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, notoriously said, his members are

like "cockroaches". Once in the House, they are notoriously difficult to remove.



The impact of Ukip on Labour's electoral chances, however, may not be nearly so

benign. The Ukip surge is a warning. Immediate analysis indicates that two

groups, in the main, have been swayed by Farage. They are the less qualified,

working-class, older male and the lower middle class who are very squeezed

indeed. Traditionally, the former group would have voted Labour. Since the

1980s, according to Ben Page of Ipsos-Mori, that allegiance has been under

pressure, opening up a fissure, which Ukip can easily widen, threatening Labour

seats in its heartlands. So what is Labour to do?



It needs urgently to address the profound democratic disconnection that Ukip's

success has exposed - a disconnection that is a major challenge for all three

main parties. Ukip's rise undoubtedly has much to do with Farage himself. Public

school-educated, time in the City, affluent and affable, he, like Boris, has

turned being "off message" into an electoral asset. For many, he has

authenticity because he appears a man of the people.



Farage's common touch has an impact on Ed Miliband too. He has embarked on a

brave and much needed enterprise - to build a fairer social contract that

responds to concerns about immigration and delivers growth and prosperity for

all. The mechanics of how such a contract is constructed and costed is one

issue; another is Miliband's need to develop a more populist touch.



Another example of the disconnect in action is the dismissal by many politicians

and commentators of Ukip's rise as the consequence of a temporary protest vote.

For many voters, the party's policies matter a great deal, albeit a number are

already becoming unstitched. The immigration cap of 50,000 a year is under

revision, for instance. But on other issues, Farage is clear about his goals, if

not about the means to achieve them. He has said he will oversee the UK's

withdrawal from the EU, increase defence spending by 40%, install smoking rooms

in pubs, bring back grammar schools and cut taxes. The price tag is elusive.

Critics say his aim is a mythical Britain of the 1950s reclaimed.



A more constructive criticism would focus less on Ukip - its inconsistencies

will reveal themselves in due course - and more on the failings of the main

parties whose perceived arrogance has encouraged the populist right to flourish.

For years, polls have registered voters' escalating disillusionment - witnessed

again in Thursday's low turnout. They look at their own community and see

diversity, whether welcome or otherwise. They look at Westminster and see a

largely white, male, middle-class set of career politicians. Trust has

evaporated. As in Europe as a whole, the political class is deemed to have

presided over an economic disaster that threatens the livelihoods and futures of

millions. Insecurity is rife, exacerbated by the cuts.



In 2011, Joe Hayman spent three months interviewing a thousand people across the

UK and in British Voices, published last year, he captured what the surveys tell

us. Large numbers of Britons feel isolated and alienated. Voter apathy is high

while belief in the integrity and competence of politicians is low. Populist

parties across Europe range from moderate to extreme radical right, but what

they share in common, as Anthony Painter describes in a paper for the thinktank

Policy Network, is an anti-elite determination to be "brand changers", to

reshape the way democracy functions and the issues it prioritises. Ukip has

little doctrine, a jalopy of a manifesto - its powerful attraction is its "us"

against "them" ethos. Unless Labour, Lib Dem and Conservatives respond to the

warnings, Farage will be moulding their futures.



Something fundamental is at stake. Farage's stated aim is to move politics

significantly to the right but retain Ukip's identity as the true voice of the

centre ground: a potentially harmful strategy for sound civic health. It is

imperative that the three main parties work to find credible, just and

innovative ways to reconnect parliament and the people.



"We get it," Tory chairman Grant Shapps said following Thursday's vote. Ukip is

right to believe that, as yet, they don't.

Comment: David Cameron won't prosper by trying to outkip the Kippers: Both the

Tories and Labour have several reasons to be troubled by the Ukip surge - and

one to be grateful for it



BYLINE: Andrew Rawnsley



SECTION: OBSERVER NEW COMMENT PAGES; Pg. 39



LENGTH: 1507 words





Depending on who has been speaking, and their taste in hyperbolic metaphors, the

surge to Ukip is either a "sea change" in British politics or it is a "seismic

event".



To which I say: take a cold shower and calm down. Nigel Farage is understandably

elated - and the established parties are naturally stunned - by Ukip's

performance in the county council elections, but it is deserving of neither

comparisons with earthquakes nor quotes from Shakespeare. A sea change is what

happened when Jim Callaghan was booted out by Margaret Thatcher at the general

election of 1979 to usher in 18 years of Conservative rule. A seismic event is

what occurred when Tony Blair won the general election of 1997 by the largest

parliamentary landslide in modern history. On Thursday, Ukip won just shy of a

quarter of the votes in local government elections mainly confined to the shires

of England, in which a third of the potential electorate turned out. That is

clearly noteworthy, but it is extremely premature to start jabbering that this

is a historic turning point.



No doubt Ukip's leader would retort that this is typical of the condescension

that his party has received from those who dwell inside the "Westminster

bubble". Actually, I've never dismissed them. I forecast many months ago that

they were very likely to top the poll in next year's Euro-elections, a

prediction that then looked a bit bold, but is now hardening into a consensus

expectation. I fully expected the Farageists to do very well in these county

contests. My point is that there is a very important difference between a local

election upset, even a big one, and events that recast the political landscape

forever.



Several forces are at work, some fairly particular to this moment, some more

deep-seated, which have been powering Mr Farage's gang. One is the desire of a

section of the electorate to thrust an angry two fingers up at the entire

political establishment. That urge is especially intense when a government is at

midterm, there is a tight squeeze on living standards and there is no great

enthusiasm for the principal party of conventional opposition. The beneficiaries

in the past were usually the Lib Dems and sometimes other parties, such as the

BNP and the Greens and Ukip itself, which did very well at the Euro-elections of

2004 and 2009 only to fizzle out by the time of the general elections a year

later. Since the Lib Dems made the transition from party of protest to party of

government, that vote has been in need of a new way of expressing itself.



Before Thursday, Mr Farage seemed generally content to accept the idea that his

party was principally a party of protest, suggesting his main aim was not to win

parliamentary seats but to draw the other parties, especially the Tories, on to

his agenda. In the wake of the results, he has been emboldened to claim they are

an endorsement of his party's "positive policy solutions".



I don't think so, Nigel. I have a hunch that Ukip did not attract support

because of its plans for the health service or its industrial strategy.

Actually, it is more than a hunch. Polling of Ukip voters by YouGov finds that

less than 10% of them back the party because they think it "would run the

country well" and more than 60% say a main reason to support Ukip is because

they are "unhappy with the major parties" or want to "send a message".



The arrival of four-party politics in England, something the Welsh and the Scots

have been used to for more than a generation, certainly poses big challenges for

those established parties. Ukip voters are not coming only from the Tories, but

their principal effect is to split the vote on the right. The Conservatives, who

did such a good job of persuading people to reject electoral reform in the

referendum two years ago, may live to regret not embracing the alternative vote.



The Tories are more confused and divided than ever about how to respond. They

have tried attacking Ukip, but labelling them as "clowns", even if often true,

only seems to enhance their appeal as an anti-establishment party. The new Tory

line, scripted from the top, is to be polite. So they are now fruitcakes whom

the prime minister "respects".



The right of his party are predictably clamouring for David Cameron to get into

an auction for Ukip voters. Here they go again. Be tougher on immigration. Slash

even deeper at welfare. Scrap gay marriage. Harden up or advance the pledge to

hold a referendum on membership of the European Union. They clearly did not

notice that chasing after Ukip voters is exactly what the Tories did during the

local election campaign. There was the clumsy announcement of the termination of

international aid to South Africa, noises about toughening up prison regimes and

cracking down harder on welfare and immigration, and suggestions of firming up

the pledge on a EU referendum - all moves designed to woo the Ukip-inclined. The

Tories tried the same at the Eastleigh byelection and it didn't work then

either. As I've remarked before, you can't outkip the Kippers. If Mr Cameron

succumbs to the internal pressure to move right, he risks further diminishing

the appeal of the Tory party to the centrist voters without whom he cannot

possibly hope to win a general election in 2015.



The better Tory strategy would be to focus on the fact that Nigel Farage is not

going to become prime minister. This won't stop him demanding a place in any

televised leaders' debate, but I would wager as many pints as he can drink

between now and May 2015 that he is not going to be kissing hands with the

Queen. The majority of Ukip voters tell pollsters that the Conservatives are

their second-choice party. That gives Tories reasonable grounds to hope that

many can be won back at a general election, when they will present the choice as

a binary one between David Cameron and Ed Miliband. There is only one problem

with this strategy. It requires the Tories to keep their heads and holding their

nerve is something they find hard to do for two minutes, never mind two years.



In terms of what they indicate about political enthusiasm and momentum, these

elections are also troubling for Labour. Ed Miliband's people can point to some

encouraging performances in key battleground areas in southern England such as

Harlow in Essex and Hastings in Sussex. But Labour's overall performance was

underwhelming. While most obviously a threat to the Tories, Ukip is also

attracting support from less affluent, traditionally Labour voters. What ought

to worry Ed Miliband a lot is that these "squeezed middle" voters are precisely

the people whom he has been targeting for nearly three years now. A significant

slice of them prefer Mr Farage's beer-swilling, right-wing populism to the

Labour leader's theorising about a new paradigm of capitalism. Sticking the

Labour leader on a pop-up soap box - it is actually a pallet - has not solved

the problem. A lesson for Labour to learn from the Ukip leader is that it is

essential to translate ideas and policy into accessible language that can be

sold on the doorstep.



It is for the Lib Dems that these results have the most paradoxical

implications. They lost another slew of councillors and were humiliated at the

South Shields byelection, coming in seventh, only just ahead of the Monster

Raving Loonies. Yet in terms of the larger picture, there are a few glimmers of

encouragement for Nick Clegg's party. They did better in areas where they hold

parliamentary seats. Neither the Tories nor Labour show a convincing capacity to

mobilise enough voters behind them to justify any confidence that they can win a

parliamentary majority. That is a strong pointer towards the next general

election producing another hung parliament.



The big challenge for all the established parties is how to deal with the

"anti-politics" mood that Ukip is feeding off, the resentment felt by many

voters that Britain is run in their own interests and those of their friends by

a lookalike metropolitan elite who are all implicated in the economic mess. It

is quite amusing that this vote should flow to Ukip. Its leader is a very

well-paid MEP, who is never backward in putting in for his expenses, the son of

a stockbroker who went to private school, used to trade commodities and likes to

prance around in a green Barbour and a fedora. Ukip's treasurer, Stuart Wheeler,

is a multimillionaire old Etonian who lives in a Jacobean castle. These are

rather unlikely characters to be the tribunes of the people against the

political class that Ukip claims to despise.



Ukip may be inhabited by oddballs, the unsavoury and worse, but there is one

sense in which the mainstream parties should be grateful to this particularly

English way of protesting. Across Europe, austerity is fuelling a revolt against

the political establishment that is manifesting itself in surges of support for

the hard left or the far right - parties such as Marine Le Pen's Front National

in France and the fascist Golden Dawn in Greece. We will have done well if Ukip

is as ugly as it ever gets here.

In Focus: What a hoot! How one man has changed British politics: Ukip's stunning

success in the local elections surprised many - but not its leader. As

mainstream figures fail to connect with the public, Nigel Farage is the UK's

newest political celebrity. Toby Helm and Daniel Boffey assess the impact of his

insurgency on worried opponents across the spectrum

When Nigel Farage needs a break he heads out to sea. On Saturday, after 24 hours

of wall-to-wall media appearances he drove to the south coast and went fishing

in the Channel with friends. It was the only place he could be sure of being out

of mobile phone contact.



"I turn the bugger off," he told the Observer. "It clears the head. When I am

out there I don't think about anything except what bait to use, what lure to use

and why some other bloke is catching more than me."



Farage was briefly cutting himself adrift from politics after his party, Ukip,

had stirred up the waters as never before by securing a stunning 23% of the vote

in Thursday's local elections. Farage had predicted that Ukip would take at

least 14% a couple of weeks ago, which many had thought was wildly optimistic.



But it exceeded his wildest dreams, increasing its number of council seats from

eight to 147 overnight, eating into the Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrat

support across the country. For the first time ever, none of the mainstream

parties took more than the 30% of the vote. Labour secured 29%, the Tories 25%

and the Lib Dems 14%. Nothing like it had happened before.



Up until this weekend experts had doubted Ukip's ability to establish itself as

more than a protest party, and believed that it would fade at the 2015 general

election, as it had in 2010. But those experts are changing their tune.



Tony Travers, of the London School of Economics, said: "I am normally cautious

but I do think the tectonic plates are shifting. The share of the vote of the

main two parties has been declining since the 1950s. But it is now even lower

than it was at the height of the scandal over MPs expenses in 2009. You can half

imagine David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg having to have a meeting to

think what to do as Ukip is hurting them all."



On Thursday afternoon, when voting was still under way, a Ukip official rang

Radio 4's Today programme asking if it wanted Farage on the show the next

morning and was given a noncommittal response. At 5.55am on Friday, as it was

clear Ukip was making big inroads, Today rang back to book Farage in for a prime

slot.



"They had woken up to the fact that we really were the story," said Gawain

Towler, Farage's spokesman.



So what, for the man at the centre of it all, had been the biggest lesson?

"Simple. It is that the rest of them don't speak the same language as normal

people," he said. "They can't connect with people out there. The change that has

happened to people's lives from immigration is extraordinary, but the other

parties have nothing to say about it. They make vague promises and don't

deliver."



The Ukip leader may have been a member of the European parliament since 1999 but

he loves to present himself as cut off from the "political class", or what he

often refers to as "the establishment elite". In one of his BBC TV appearances

on Friday afternoon Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, asked how

many seats Farage thought Ukip would win at the next general election. "I have

no idea," Farage barked back with something between a grin and a scowl. "I am

not a professional politician like you."



This is the nightmare facing the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems. Farage is

breaking the mould not just by speaking about the need to withdraw from the EU

but by not being one of them. He is the bloke talking common sense on the

street, the fellow who goes fishing on his day off.



Towler noted the terror written on the faces of his Tory, Labour and Lib Dem

opponents throughout Friday: "What you saw was a recognition from the other

parties that we have to deal with these buggers, but they have not the faintest

idea how to do it. Nigel does not fit with their game, their way of doing

things. He is different. He doesn't do focus groups."



Yesterday on the streets of Huntingdon, where Ukip's surge had deprived the

Tories of control of Cambridgeshire council, people spoke well of Farage, who

visited the town two weeks ago. "You don't see many people wearing yellow

corduroy trousers and tweed jackets around here," said Graham Tibbitt, 60. "He's

a breath of fresh air. I voted Ukip. He's better than the usual stodgy men in

suits."



This weekend, whatever Farage's desire to position himself as an outsider, Ukip

has landed at the heart of British politics. His party may still have no seats

at Westminster but it is a big step nearer getting one. It is confident of

emerging with the largest share of the votes at next year's European elections,

a result that would cause even deeper trauma inside the Tory party than it is

experiencing now. Farage will then stand at the 2015 election.



He is demanding the right to appear alongside Cameron, Miliband and Clegg in

pre-election TV debates - something that could persuade Cameron to ditch them

altogether, leaving himself open to charges of cowardice. Like the Lib Dems have

done since the 1980s, Ukip is putting down roots in local government and it is

the first stage on a journey.



"What I have always said is that if we establish a bridgehead in the county

councils we can have a serious tilt at winning a Westminster seat," explained

Farage. "We have done that now."



Ukip's rise under Farage is not a lone phenomenon in the EU, though that will be

of little comfort to the mainstream parties. Populist politicians are on the

rise all over Europe as people have seen leaders and institutions, domestic and

European, unable to deal with the economic crisis.



Disillusion has mixed lethally with a sense of dislocation from power. Faith in

remote institutions has been eroded as insecurity has grown. New parties

unconnected with the establishment have cashed in. In Italy this year, Beppe

Grillo's Five Star Movement scored more than 25% in the national election and is

the country's single largest party.



In Greece, Alexis Tsipras, leader of the Greek leftwing movement, is polling at

20%. In France last year, Marine Le Pen scored 18% in the presidential election

and is now powering ahead against Francois Hollande, while in the Netherlands

Geert Wilders' Freedom party is polling at 15%.



Jamie Bartlett, of the thinktank Demos, who has studied populist movements in

the EU, talks of "declining trust in the way politics is done, and a feeling

that the institutions that govern our lives don't represent us any more. People

want someone who seems authentic, ordinary, like them."



Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, said the combination

of economic crisis and bad governance by EU leaders had created the ideal

climate in which populism could grow. He said: "We have a weak economy, weak

leadership and a very badly run EU. It would be very surprising if there were

not these populist movements growing up."



So how to stop Farage? Do the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems react or just sit back

and hope that a party with few developed policies beyond getting out of the EU

and barring more Romanians and Bulgarians coming to this country will implode

under greater scrutiny?



Next year's European elections are now a terrifying prospect for the Tories.

Already this weekend, Tory Eurosceptics are demanding that Cameron brings

forward a referendum on Europe to May 2014. David Ruffley, the Tory MP for Bury

St Edmunds, said action from Cameron was needed now because voters had not

noticed the prime minister's previous commitment to an in-out referendum in

2017.



"The Ukip insurgency is real and it is serious," he said. "In 12 months' time,

at the European elections, we will have another dose of this. We must act now."



Ruffley, like other Tories, including former leadership candidate David Davis

and former cabinet minister John Redwood, wants Cameron to push a bill through

parliament for a "mandate" referendum, to be held on the same day as the

European poll, which will ask people whether they want to empower Cameron to go

to Brussels and demand powers back from the EU over everything from policing, to

employment, the EU budget and immigration. It would show he means it, they say.



Already the Tories, under the management of their new Australian strategist

Lynton Crosby, are moving right and ditching policies unpopular with the party.

In a major U-turn they have decided not to legislate to bind future governments

to commit at least 0.7% of GNP to international aid, despite repeated pledges to

do so. The dilemma for Cameron is how far he can go to the right without being

seen to abandon the centre ground.



For Labour and the Lib Dems, too, Ukip poses profound questions. If the Tories

commit to a referendum sooner than currently envisaged, can Miliband or Clegg

risk going into the next election without shifting to a much more Eurosceptic

position well before then? This weekend both parties insist that they will not

be swayed by Ukip and will stand firm with existing policies.



"I think what we need is not to obsess about Europe for the next year, but to

focus on what people really care about, which is living standards," said a Lib

Dem official.



Farage, meanwhile, is enjoying looking on at the panic and havoc he is causing.

"They're all trying to protect their seats but that is not what bothers me," he

said in another jibe at the political class he pretends not to be a part of. "I

just came into politics to make a change."

WHAT SHOULD THE PARTIES DO?



THE TORIES



Fraser Nelson, editor, the Spectator



The Tories must realise that Ukip is morphing into a working-class party and

respond by coming up with their own message. I recently sneaked into the back of

a Ukip rally in the Midlands, half-expecting to find Farage blowing

anti-immigrant dog-whistles to the kind of audience that the BNP was attracting

in its heyday. Instead Farage said he welcomed immigrants of any creed or colour

as long as they were skilled. He was cheered by the type of people you once

found at Tory conferences. Ukip's appeal lies in its relevance to the concerns

of voters - the people in places such as Boston, now a Ukip town. He realises

that politics is not a Westminster parlour game played by PPE graduates. Ukip's

rise is a reminder that the size of our problems has outgrown the smallness of

our politics.



LIBERAL DEMOCRATS



Mark Pack, editor of Liberal Democrat Newswire



The anti-establishment rage may have been picked up by a rightwing party, but

wise Liberal Democrats will respond to the underlying issues - the need for a

stronger economy and a more responsive political system - rather than start

talking up rightwing stances on immigration or Europe. Some of Ukip's support

comes from places Lib Dems should leave well alone - especially those yearning

for a 50s-style society of white men at work, white women at home and gays in

the closet. The people who feel stripped of political power and facing economic

tough times are the ones the Lib Dems should look to win over. The party is able

to make progress where it listens carefully, campaigns intensively and doesn't

stop when polling day is over.



LABOUR



Rowenna Davis, below, Labour councillor in Southwark, London



The best way of dealing with Farage is to hand out copies of Ukip's manifesto.

People turn away from his grin pretty quickly when they hear he wants to lower

tax rates for the rich, outlaw gay marriage and replace maternity rights with a

return to smoking in public places. But the best way to deal with Ukip shouldn't

be Farage's manifesto - it should be Labour's. We have to win back trust on the

"difficult issues". Why didn't we have transition controls on immigration like

other EU countries? Ukip's answers might be rubbish, but the questions they

raise are legitimate.

Front: Tories call for rapid EU vote to halt Ukip surge



BYLINE: Toby Helm, Political Editor



SECTION: OBSERVER HOME NEWS PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 690 words





The extent of Tory concern over the rise of Ukip burst into the open last night

as senior Conservatives demanded two referendums on Europe - the first next

spring - in a bid to halt the rise of Nigel Farage's rampant anti-EU party.



Members of the Thatcherite No Turning Back group broke cover to call for the

two-stage referendum package, after the Conservatives suffered heavy defeats at

the hands of Ukip in Thursday's council elections.



While the Tories' loss of 335 seats was less than some party figures had feared,

Ukip's surge to 23% of the vote - just 2% behind the Tories - reinforced their

fear that Farage and his team could emerge as the largest party from next year's

European elections. Tories are increasingly concerned that, if they fail to act,

Farage could go on to inflict serious damage on their prospects of keeping

Labour out of power at the 2015 general election.



The MPs demanding an urgent response, including David Davis, the former

leadership challenger, called on David Cameron to give the public absolute

certainty about his intentions over Europe by legislating soon for an initial

"mandate" referendum, to take place next year, ahead of or at the same time as

the European elections in May.



The purpose would be to strengthen the prime minister's negotiating hand and

show the party was serious about securing a new deal for the UK in the face of

the Ukip charge.



In the first referendum, people would be asked to give Cameron authority to

renegotiate the terms of UK membership on issues such as employment policy,

co-operation over police and justice policy, and immigration. A second in/out

referendum would be held, as is planned in the next parliament, in which people

would be asked if they wanted to remain in the EU after a deal was reached with

the UK's EU partners.



Davis told the Observer that having a first referendum next year would be "an

absolute Ukip killer", as Farage would have either to back the plan or show his

inflexibility. "It would massively reinforce the prime minister's negotiating

hand and put some steel in his back," he said. "He would be more likely to

return from any negotiation with a good deal that would mean we stay in the EU."



Tory MP David Ruffley said that Cameron's previous pledge to hold an in/out

referendum in 2017 after any new treaty is negotiated had not registered with

the public, as it was too distant and vague.



"David Cameron has to have a clear, sharper message on Europe because most

people are not aware of his referendum pledge," he said.



"This would be a concrete vote showing that Conservatives are serious about

getting a referendum. It is about focusing minds. This Ukip insurgency is real

and it's serious. Twelve months from now we will have another dose of this (at

the council and European elections). We have to act now."



MPs concede it is too late to insert a bill for a first referendum into this

week's Queen's speech - which the coalition will use to highlight measures to

boost the economy, including legislation for the HS2 high-speed rail line

between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds - but say one could be

introduced within the next few months.



Such a move is bound to be resisted by the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, who say the

government should stand by existing coalition policy. A party official said: "We

should not spend the next year obsessing about Europe. We should concentrate on

what really concerns people, which is their living standards."



Home secretary Theresa May yesterday conceded that the government had to show

"greater certainty" about its intention to hold a referendum on EU membership,

but said the negotiations, which will happen after 2015, had to take place

first. She said: "If you want to take a renegotiated settlement to the British

people, you have to renegotiate it. We can look at whether we can give some

greater certainty in terms of the referendum."



She did not rule out legislation in the current parliament to pave the way for a

referendum, despite the tensions it would create with the Tories' Lib Dem

coalition partners.

Front: Ukip on the march: Party wins 139 seats and 25% of vote: Farage revels in

shock to establishment



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour, Political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 1123 words





A contrite David Cameron yesterday promised to show a surging UK Independence

party respect after it gained more than 130 seats in the English county

elections and polled 25% of the national vote. The result led the party's

leader, Nigel Farage, to claim the birth of a new and irreversible era of

four-party politics.



Cameron, who once described Ukip as fruitcakes and closet racists, admitted his

mistake, saying it was no good insulting a political party that people had

chosen to vote for: "We need to show respect for people who have taken the

choice to support this party. And we're going to work really hard to win them

back."



Farage said the result would send a shockwave through the political elite.

"We've been abused by everybody, attacked by the entire establishment, who did

their best to stop ordinary, decent people from going out and voting Ukip. The

establishment has been shocked and stunned," he said.



No 10 was settling on a twin-track strategy of hardening its appeal to the

right, and subjecting Ukip policies to intense scrutiny over the next two years.

But Conservatives have been shifting to the right for the past six months,

including on Europe, immigration and welfare, and on the basis of these results

have apparently not yet found a formula to stop the haemorrhage of support to

Ukip.



Bolstering those calls for a harder line, David Davis, once a challenger for the

party leadership, has written in today's Daily Telegraph that Cameron needs to

"break the impression of being privileged and out of touch" and stop surrounding

himself with advisers who went to top public schools. Davis also said that the

prime minister should bring forward the EU referendum and introduce "serious tax

breaks" for married couples.



In a sign of Ukip's impact, no established party scored over 30% of the vote,

with the BBC reporting Labour at 29%, Conservative 25%, Ukip 23% and Liberal

Democrats 14%. Initial evidence showed that Ukip drew most support from socially

conservative, older, working-class voters, especially in East Anglia, the south

and south-west.



After 35 councils had declared, Labour had gained only two - Nottinghamshire and

Derbyshire - but said its haul of 291 seats gained was in line with

expectations. It claimed its low overall share masked the progress made in the

46 target parliamentary seats contested in these elections and which are

necessary to secure a large overall majority. The Lib Dems lost 124 seats. Ukip

gained 139, and the Conservatives lost 335.



However, Ukip's effect on the local elections extends further than the 139 seats

it won. Analysis by the Guardian's datablog reveals that it split the vote,

keeping out hundreds more Tory candidates.



Labour aides said: "This is Cameron's worst nightmare. He is losing votes to the

right, and he is losing votes to us in marginal seats. A four-party dynamic

works against the Conservatives much more than it works against us."



Miliband conceded that there was more work to do, adding that disaffection with

politics was his biggest opponent.



The Lib Dem leader, Nick Clegg, whose party came seventh in the South Shields

byelection, tried to point to the way in which his party's vote had held up in

areas where it has sitting MPs. He said: "The Liberal Democrats are on a journey

from a party of protest to a party of government. Where we have MPs setting out

our side of the story, we are holding our own."



But one Lib Dem minister, Jeremy Browne, claimed Britain had now entered a

permanent period of four-party politics. There were other warnings from defeated

Lib Dem candidates, such as the former MP Sandra Gidley, that Clegg was a major

negative on the doorstep. She called for fresh blood.



The biggest inquest is likely to come on the Conservative side as it tries to

assess the best way to repel the Ukip advance, and whether the solution lies in

different policies, style or personnel.



The Tory right demanded early legislation to guarantee an in/out referendum on

Europe after 2015, and hopes for a serious clampdown on benefits for EU migrants

in Wednesday's Queen's speech. One defeated Tory council leader, Kay Cutts, the

former leader of Nottinghamshire council, said simply: "We want our country

back."



Michael Gove, the education secretary and one of Cameron's much criticised inner

circle, called for calm analysis, saying people support Ukip because they are

fed up with the political classes.



He told the BBC: "There is a sense sometimes of exasperation with the political

classes. We do sometimes seem, the three of us, the pasteurised cheese on the

cheeseboard, and then Ukip is the rich, ripe, stinky alternative, and people

think: 'Don't mind having a slice of that.'



"I can understand that. Nigel Farage is a very effective and charismatic figure

and he can effectively articulate the anxieties people feel and their

exasperation with the political class."



Gove also warned Conservative critics of Cameron that it would be "bonkeroony"

to attempt to overthrow the prime minister as the party leadership moved to

assert its authority after Ukip's strong showing.



He said: "I think that any of my colleagues who want to indulge in leadership

speculation should spend the weekend reading the history books and consider if

leadership speculation has ever helped any political party to enhance its

position with the voters. The idea of changing the leader is bonkeroony."



One Lib Dem source claimed there was a delicious irony in the way in which Tory

tabloid papers had whipped up an anti-EU and anti-immigrant frenzy: the

beneficiaries had been Ukip, and the main losers at the next general election

will be the Tories. "They have created a monster they can no longer control; the

Tories under Cameron have found themselves back to dealing with the same

problems as they had in the runup to 1997 over Maastricht."



The Guardian datablog analysis of results in 20 of the earliest councils to

declare showed that out of a total of 1,343 council seats across the regions

analysed, Ukip picked up a total of 73 seats.



However, in a further 226 seats secured by neither Ukip or the Conservatives,

their vote share combined would have been enough to take the seat - meaning the

indirect effect of Ukip on the split Tory vote is larger by far than a simple

count of the number of council seats won by the Eurosceptic party.

National: Elections 2013: Immigration and welfare on Cameron's mind as he aims

to disarm Ukip threat: PM to reach out to Tory defectors in Queen's speech: But

Gove says there will be no lurch to the right



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt, Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 8



LENGTH: 978 words





David Cameron will try to reach out to former Tory voters who defected to Ukip

in the local elections by characterising next week's Queen's speech as a

concerted attempt to address their concerns over immigration and welfare.



As Tory MPs on the right of the party called for tougher action on Europe and

immigration, Downing Street was preparing to launch a media blitz over the

weekend to show that the government is taking action in key areas highlighted by

Ukip.



The Queen's speech on Wednesday will contain measures to limit benefits to some

immigrants with a particular focus on placing restrictions on access to the NHS.



This is designed to show that the government is taking action ahead of the

lifting of transitional controls on citizens from Romania and Bulgaria, who will

have full rights to work in the EU from next year.



Downing Street is also indicating to Tory MPs that the prime minister is ready

to back a private members' bill in the new session of parliament that would

legislate for an



in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership after the next election.



No 10 acknowledged that it could not introduce any bill authorising an EU

referendum as a government measure in the face of Liberal Democrat opposition.

"It is impractical to bring it in as a government measure," one source said.



Downing Street regarded the results in the English local elections as a mixed

blessing. The Tories suffered the loss of 335 seats, comfortably within the

range predicted by psephologists, who said the party was bound to suffer on the

grounds that the seats were last contested in 2009 when Cameron was riding on a

high the year before the general election.



But on the downside, many Tory voters defected to Ukip, ensuring that the Tories

lost control of bastions in Lincolnshire and Norfolk. They had more success

elsewhere, as they held on in counties such as Hertfordshire and Somerset.



The signals from No 10 came as Tories on the right called on Cameron to

acknowledge the way in which Ukip is resonating. Sir Gerald Howarth, the

Thatcherite former defence minister, lamented the loss of a Conservative

councillor in Hampshire and then added in a tweet: "We need to take tougher

action on serious concerns of the public on immigration and Europe."



John Baron, the Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay, who is demanding

legislation during this parliament for an in/out EU referendum, said Ukip should

no longer be seen as a protest party. "Some of its members have genuine concerns

about the EU which we need to address," he said.



Michael Gove, the education secretary, cautioned that there would be no lurch to

the right. "There is no - and I don't think there should be - fundamental

change," he told Radio 4's The World at One.



But Gove, who said the government has taken action in many areas highlighted by

Ukip, acknowledged it was taking time for changes to be noticed. He said: "When

it comes to the concerns that voters have who didn't vote Conservative - some of

whom voted Ukip, some of whom didn't vote at all - I think there has been a gap

between the decisions we have taken and the implementation on the ground which,

naturally, will cause some people to say to this government: we need to see

results.



"We are seeing results. There was hard parliamentary pounding in order to make

sure we could change the welfare system so that once more we had an approach to

benefits which rewarded and incentivised work. It is only this week that the

universal credit is being rolled out."



Gove also warned against any attempt to overthrow the prime minister after some

defeated councillors questioned his leadership. "I think that any of my

colleagues who want to indulge in leadership speculation should spend the

weekend reading the history books and consider if leadership speculation has

ever helped any political party to enhance its position with the voters. The

idea of changing the leader is bonkeroony."



Gove spoke out after Graham Marsh, who lost his seat in Lincolnshire after a

Ukip surge, told The World at One that his "rockbed supporters" were angry about

the "half promise" of an EU referendum and the time spent on legalising equal

marriage. Asked how long Cameron should have to make changes, Marsh said: "I

think he has had long enough."



Senior Tory MPs cautioned that Cameron should act with care as he responds to

Ukip. One MP said: "I suspect the prime minister's head will tell him it is no

good chasing after Ukip, which is basically feeding crocodiles. If we could wave

a magic wand and put an EU referendum bill in the Queen's speech, would it have

a magical effect? I doubt it. We need to concentrate on bread-and-butter issues.



"It is entirely self-defeating to go after David Cameron. The Conservative party

often veers between complacency and panic. Colleagues are in the process of

absorbing what has happened. There will no doubt be a lot of chatter behind the

scenes over the weekend."



Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, said the party had been "obliterated" in the

South Shields byelection, where it came seventh. But the party said it performed

well in certain areas, such as Cheltenham, where it has MPs and a large number

of councillors.



Nick Clegg said: "It is not good to lose hardworking councillors, as we have

done in these elections. The Liberal Democrats are on a journey from a party of

protest to a party of government. Actually, the pattern that has emerged shows

very clearly that where we have MPs, where we have Liberal Democrats out on the

doorstep setting out our side to the story, we are holding our own and in some

areas actually making gains."



The Lib Dems saw their vote fall on average by 12 points. John Curtice,

professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said the loss of just

124 seats "flattered to deceive" because Lib Dems were mostly fighting Tories

whose vote share also fell.

Leading Article: Local elections: Shouting from the shires



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 44



LENGTH: 665 words





Just about every American to have captured the White House since Nixon has

styled themselves as an outsider, riding into Washington to shake up a

discredited elite. Neither governing for the 1% nor even being the son of a

former president precluded this distinctive rhetoric, which has never gripped

Britain in the quite same way. Yesterday, however, Nigel Farage led Ukip on a

proudly upstart charge into the county halls of shire England. The BBC's

projected national vote shares implied that the political category we used to

dismiss as "others" - that is, Ukip plus the rest of the political fringe - was

top of the poll, while all three of the so-called major parties turned in dismal

scores.



A great deal separates Ukip's Little England nationalism from folksy American

posturing, but exactly as in the US it is as well to ask what lies behind the

rebellious talk. A man who gasps to defy the busybodies who prevent him from

sparking up in the pub, Mr Farage is the right man to sound the call for a

rabble army. But it is as well to recall that Ukip's incoherent policy platform

mixes fear-mongering about immigration with flat tax that would redistribute to

the rich, and that its avowed love of freedom does not extend to gay people who

want to get married. Neither Ukip policy nor its occasionally unsavoury

personnel are subjected to the same sort of scrutiny as the more established

tribes. Most of the hundreds of thousands who trooped to the ballot box to put a

cross next their local Ukip candidate were clearer about what they were voting

against than what they were voting for - and therein lies the dismal message for

the rest of the political pack.



The Labour party came out least bruised, outpolling the Tories where it mattered

- in those urban enclaves within the shires, from Lincoln to Harlow, which will

determine the outcome in 2015. To point this out is fair enough, but - in its

heart - Labour must also know that it is still not good enough for this stage of

the game. The party slightly undershot a mid-term poll rating which is already

too modest to make victory assured, and above all it failed to do what thriving

oppositions do and become the natural home for the great bulk of malcontents.



For the Conservatives, the bad news is less qualified. The direct upshot of

Ukip's surge, which draws disproportionately from Tory support, was the loss of

a worse-than-expected 335 seats, and a few previously true blue counties such as

Lincolnshire and Norfolk. The destabilising dynamics, which are the indirect

consequence, are even worse news for David Cameron. He will face enormous

pressure from that element in his party that hankers for a Ukip-style Tory

party. No matter the gamble he made at the start of the year - to counter the

Ukip threat with the promise of a EU referendum - is now a gamble that he has

demonstrably lost. "Double or nothing" will be the cry from the right, and

unless Mr Cameron can muster more strength than he has recently shown, he could

jeopardise the future of his coalition with the Liberal Democrats. His one

comfort is that his partners' (these days almost routinely) dismal performance

will frighten them off walking away and triggering an early election.



The Lib Dems imagine themselves as having nothing in common with Ukip, and in

policy terms that is true. Before they entered government, however, their vote

was similarly swelled by that element in the electorate more interested in

flipping the thumbs down at the agenda of those in power, than in endorsing any

particular alternative plan. As the slump leaves the establishment parties

offering different flavours of pain, the "none of the above" contingent is

growing. In the end, the substance of that will have to be addressed. In the

meantime, all three parties would do well to do away with alien and

infuriatingly upbeat talk of "aspiration", and engage with the grumpy tone of a

nation that is thoroughly fed up at finding that its pay packet is buying less

each year.

Local elections: Local elections: Cameron moves to fend off Farage with EU

pledge: PM considers stronger referendum commitment 'Keep the abuse coming,'

goads anti-Europe party



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 12



LENGTH: 786 words





David Cameron launched an 11th-hour bid to fend off the threat from Ukip when he

indicated that he was prepared to give serious consideration to a Tory backbench

campaign to place an EU referendum on the statute book before the next election.



As the Tories braced themselves for losses of at least 500 seats in the English

local elections today - with a strong showing by Ukip - the prime minister said

yesterday he was prepared to "strengthen" his offer of an in/out referendum by

2017.



Cameron also reached out to the right by saying that he was prepared to listen

to calls from the military disclosed in the Guardian and allow funds from

Britain's aid budget to be diverted to peacekeeping defence operations.



The prime minister issued the signals to the right as the Tories struggled to

maintain a consistent line on the threat posed by Ukip. William Hague echoed

remarks over the weekend by Kenneth Clarke who dismissed the party as a

"collection of clowns", when he said the party had a "clown-like aspect". The

prime minister, by contrast, declined to criticise Ukip and would not even use

its name in a BBC interview.



Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, joked that the Tory insults had helped his party.

Farage told ITV News: "Keep the abuse coming, boys, keep it coming. Ken Clarke

had a go at the weekend and we went up by 2% in the opinion polls afterwards. So

please keep abusing us, because when you abuse us what you are doing is you are

abusing the vast majority of the British public who want us to be a free

independent country that controls its own borders."



The prime minister used his final interview ahead of the local elections to

reach out to voters tempted by Ukip when he indicated that he may be prepared to

throw the weight of the 304 Tory MPs behind placing a referendum on the statute

book before the next election.



The prime minister is facing strong pressure from the Tory right to face down

the Liberal Democrats, who would oppose any legislation for a referendum in this

parliament. John Baron, the MP for Basildon and Billericay, has won the support

of 100 Tory MPs for a letter calling on the prime minister to bring forward

enabling legislation for a referendum.



Cameron told The World at One on Radio 4: "I think we need to demonstrate

absolutely that we are serious about this referendum. We have said we are going

to hold it. It is going to be an in/out referendum. We have set a date by which

it must be held. Anything we can do to strengthen that offer I am prepared to

consider."



Downing Street sources acknowledged that the prime minister would not be able to

introduce any government legislation in the face of Lib Dem opposition. But they

indicated that Cameron may be prepared to support moves by backbenchers.



Baron, who warned the prime minister earlier this week that Ukip voters had

"genuine concerns" about the EU, gave a guarded welcome to the prime minister's

remarks. The MP, who is annoyed that Downing Street has failed to arrange a

meeting for him with the prime minister, said the Tory leadership would have to

agree to support a bill and not offer support for a non-binding vote.



Baron says the new session of parliament, which opens on 8 May, offers the

chance when a ballot for private members' bill will be held. If an MP who comes

near the top of the ballot supported a referendum bill it would have a strong

chance if the Tory leadership lent its support.



Baron said: "Our commitment to a referendum must be both credible and

believable. It's credible because we have the out option now. But it is not yet

believable because there is a deep public mistrust out there when people hear

politicians making promises about EU referenda. They have heard too many before

and too many have been broken.



"What would make it more believable is a serious attempt to get legislation

through in this parliament. Whether successful or not it really would show good

intent and would be more believable than a general election manifesto promise.

It would be in law."



The prime minister also reiterated his remarks during his trip to India in

February that aid spending could be diverted to peacekeeping. He told the BBC:

"There are rules for what you can use the aid budget for and it is right we obey

those rules. But I also think it is right we ask the question about what does

development actually consist of."



The Tories are defending nearly two-thirds (1,477) of the 2,362 seats up for

grabs. They expect heavy losses as they defend seats captured when they were at

a polling high in 2009, and are nervous they will be squeezed by the anti-EU

Ukip.

Comment: It's going to be emotional: Thursday is likely to be a bad night for

the Tories - and there's no quick fix for the challenge of Ukip



BYLINE: Rick Nye



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 26



LENGTH: 696 words





The mood in the Conservative party on Thursday night will be determined at least

as much by how well Ukip does in the local elections as by how badly the Tories

do. Losses to Labour in the hundreds are expected, given where the two parties

start these elections from. But it is the smaller number of seats that Ukip

seems likely to win that will have a disproportionate impact on the Conservative

psyche.



Many in the party have for some time been preoccupied with how to combat the

threat of Ukip. But that preoccupation has become an obsession since David

Cameron's promise of an "in-out" referendum on Europe failed to dent Ukip's

appeal. A strong Ukip candidate and a campaign that denied the Conservatives a

morale-boosting gain in the Eastleigh byelection added to the pressure. If Ukip

adds sizeably to its number of county councillors on Thursday, it will do more

than rub salt in Tory wounds; it will start another round of soul-searching over

what to do about Ukip.



The Tories should start by putting the challenge posed by the party into

perspective. The Ukip challenge is not, first and foremost, a problem about

Europe. As Michael Ashcroft pointed out earlier this week, if Nigel Farage's

primary aim really is to withdraw Britain from the EU, then taking votes away

from the one party prepared to offer that option after the next election is a

funny way of achieving it. Polls show that it is not the Europe issue - or

indeed any policies at all - that drive voters to Ukip.



The heart of the party's appeal is that it prefers life as it once was in

Britain to what it is today. It is this emotional basis that makes dealing with

Ukip in government so difficult. The problem is that there is an irreducible

core of voters in Britain who simply regard as being beneath contempt the

compromises made by any administration as a result of the law, or international

obligations or (for now) a coalition agreement.



These people have seen their lives and what they can expect for themselves and

their families change for the worse in recent years. When Cameron talks about

the global race - the opportunities that lie ahead and the risks of being left

behind - these people look at their personal race, and fear it has already been

run. They feel they have been abandoned by all parties. It is no accident that

Ukip does disproportionately well among older, non-graduate, white men.



The ranks of these disaffected voters have been swelled not only by concerns

over immigration and migration during the recession, but also by what they see

as the failure of the political system to deal with everything from the row over

MPs' expenses and the rise of the "something for nothing society" to the banking

crisis and flagrancy of bonus culture.



Cameron has to take note of these frustrations, but he also has to distinguish

between those who are impatient with his lack of progress as prime minister and

those who are voting Ukip as a premeditated act to put themselves beyond the

reach of mainstream politics.



In other words, he has to address those who are willing to take yes for an

answer and find practical ways of demonstrating how the future can be better and

fairer, rather than get trapped into making empty promises about returning to a

past which probably never existed.



The Tory strategy must be about pitching a big tent rather than trying to huddle

for warmth inside an ever smaller one; given the electoral arithmetic, Cameron

doesn't have the luxury of choosing between those who've defected to Ukip since

2010 or pro-coalition voters who supported the Lib Dems at the last election.



Cameron needs both and more besides to win next time. That means offering a

clear vision of what Britain will look like when it emerges from austerity, who

he wants to see sharing in what he used to call the "proceeds of growth" and

reassurance that the rewards of recovery will be shared fairly. Above all, he

has to stick to his guns, particularly after nights like tomorrow. To stand any

chance of winning in May 2015, Cameron has to make clear now that there can be

no turning back.

Comment: Everyone in Spain is an indignado nowadays: Protests that flared up two

years ago have become a state of mind as people journey from private sadness to

public anger



BYLINE: Katharine Ainger



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 26



LENGTH: 1010 words





You have taken everything from me! These were the words of Inocencia Lucha, a

47-year-old Spanish woman who recently walked into her bank in Almassora,

Valencia, poured petrol over her body and set herself on fire. She was indebted

to the bank, living on euros 360 (£303) a month, and had just received an

eviction notice. Behind Spain's new unemployment figures, with 27% of the

population now out of work, lie many such stories of desperation: in the last

three months there have been 14 suicides where economic hardship was a factor

reported in the media.



It is nearly two years since the indignados ("the outraged") took over public

squares around the country to protest against the economy being run for the

benefits of the banks and not the people. Now, from the Mortgage Victims'

Platform (PAH) to the Citizens' Tide - a coalition of 350 organisations, from

health workers to trade unions and youth groups, that have mobilised hundreds of

thousands against privatisation and austerity - more people are making the

journey from private sadness to public indignation. There is a dawning

realisation that recovery is not, as the politicians promised, just around the

corner. All signs point to a "lost decade"; figures published last week show a

large increase in the number of those out of work for more than two years,

indicating a newly growing underclass. The unemployment rate is a staggering 40%

for some regions in Andalucia and 57% for young people; one in five people live

below the poverty line.



Spinoza says that sadness arises from a disconnection from our potencia - our

power to act. It is no coincidence, then, that the powerful use the language of

shame to keep us impotent: unemployment and debt are the fault of the individual

alone, they say, and social sadness a private affair. This is no doubt why Maria

Dolores de Cospedal, general secretary of the ruling Partido Popular (PP),

recently boasted that its supporters "would go hungry" rather than fail to pay

their mortgage. (This, it must be pointed out, is one way to weaken your voter

base.)



Cospedal was targeting the Mortgage Victims' Platform, which is transforming the

isolating stigma of eviction into a groundswell of popular outrage that is

fuelling practical action. Widespread mis-selling of mortgages contributed to

the huge foreclosure crisis - running at 500 eviction orders a day - that is

leaving families destitute and homeless. In just a few years the PAH has

defended hundreds of homes from eviction and forced banks to renegotiate. Ada

Colau, its spokesperson, is now a household name after calling the

representative of the Spanish Banking Association "a criminal" during a hearing

in Congress: "He is not an expert," she said. "The representatives of the banks

are the cause of the problem."



The PAH trudged pavements for more than a year to gather 1.4m signatures,

forcing the government to debate its proposal to change the draconian mortgage

law where you can lose your house and still carry mortgage debt with you for

life. Its other demands include a halt to evictions and social rent. This week

the PP gutted the legislative proposal, despite a recent ruling by the

Luxembourg court of justice that found Spanish mortgage laws contravened EU

directives. Huge popular support for the PAH demands have put PP politicians on

the offensive: politicians have described the group as "Nazis" and "terrorist

sympathisers" because activists were doorstepping them in their homes to

pressure them to pass the new law.



But it is the Spanish political class that is close to being discredited.

Corruption scandals have implicated many key members and former colleagues of

the government, including the prime minister, in taking undeclared money from

the construction and property development industries responsible for the housing

bubble. Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, has become known as Mariano Plasma

after giving press conferences via a TV screen so the media could not ask

questions; during last Friday's sombre economic announcements he made no

appearance at all.



Given the lack of accountability in the political process, social movements are

finding other, creative ways to give voice to those suffering from the crisis,

including the young people who have been forced to look for work abroad.

According to El Pais, 260,000 people aged between 16 and 30 left Spain last

year. An indignado group, Youth Without Future, is collecting portraits of these

young Spaniards, holding up signs detailing their stories of unemployment, exile

and insecurity under the slogan: "We didn't leave; they threw us out."



Meanwhile Madrilonia, an indignado blog, declares the entire economic model

broken; the authors are not waiting around for someone to fix it but building

their own alternatives, from the Catalan network of co-operatives to the Casa

Precaria in Madrid that advises people on how to go about creating their own

jobs through worker co-operatives.



Couple social deprivation with a democratic process that most people feel

alienated from and you have a recipe for social unrest. The only question is

whether protest will successfully create meaningful forms of political

participation and democratic control over economic decision-making. The

Citizen's Tide coalition, for example, is pushing for an audit of Spain's

national debt under the slogan "We don't owe, we won't pay", and a referendum

that will allow the population to register its opinion on austerity measures and

privatisation. On 1 June it will join other social movements across southern

Europe in street mobilisations against austerity and the Troika. Meanwhile, PAH

members are increasingly turning to civil disobedience. The number of

repossessed, bank-owned blocks of flats occupied by evicted families is growing.



Two years ago the indignados occupied the plazas across Spain to protest against

the crisis and demand a "real democracy". Now, it seems, indignation is becoming

a generalised condition.

Comment: The European dream is in dire need of a reality check: The EU has lost

the support of two thirds of its citizens, yet its leaders won't wake up. It's

time for a sceptics' vision



BYLINE: Simon Jenkins



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 41



LENGTH: 1070 words





Voter trust in the EU falls to record low. So proclaimed the front page of

yesterday's Guardian. In every one of the big European states, trust has gone

into "a vertiginous decline". Five years ago, no country, not even Britain,

showed more than half its voters hostile to Europe, and most were strongly

supportive. Now, according to the EU's own Eurobarometer, distrust runs at 53%

in Italy, 56% in France, 59% in Germany, 69% in the UK and 72% in Spain. The EU

has lost the support of two thirds of its citizens. Does it matter?



Nothing brings out the tribe in all of us like the issue of Europe. Voters reach

deep into their political psyche to find comfort or aversion in the idea of

European union. Any piece of news is adapted to fit. EU apologists regard this

week's news as inevitable given the politics of austerity, widely seen as

punishing ordinary people for the profligacy of recent European leaders. In time

of trouble, voters take refuge in nation and locality. It will not last.



To sceptics this will not wash. Majorities should matter to democrats, however

inconvenient. "Anti-Europeanism" was growing across Europe even before the

credit crunch - witness the Lisbon treaty referendums. It is reflected in the

rise of nationalist parties and is rampant even among such one-time EU loyalists

as Spain, Italy, Greece and Germany. As the head of the European Council on

Foreign Relations, Jose Ignacio Torreblanca, said of Wednesday's poll, "The

damage is so deep that it does not matter whether you come from a creditor or

debtor country . . . citizens now think their national democracy is being

subverted."



Even the EU president, Jose Manuel Barroso, knows he has a problem. He

complained this week of a "lack of understanding", both of the politics of

austerity and of "who does what, who decides what, who controls whom . . . And

where are we heading to?" A resulting "resurgence of populism and nationalism"

was threatening his "European dream". Yet he remains in denial that his dream is

just that.



Dreams make dangerous politics, and when they require the imposition of "yet

more Europe" against the run of public opinion, they are badly in need of a

reality check. The new requirement that the EU (in this case Germany) imposes

budgets on indebted states goes far beyond anything domestic voters seem likely

to tolerate.



Barroso's dream is becoming the vision espoused by the Columbia professor of

European history Istvan Deak, who demanded last year in the New York Times "a

new imperial construct" as the only alternative to save the continent from a

"revival of tribalism". To Deak this new empire was "a sacred task . . . an

almost religious goal: a new European faith that belongs to no church".



This sort of talk has always led Europe down the road to catastrophe. It was the

dream of the Inquisition, the Holy Roman Empire, Napoleon's viceroys and

Hitler's gauleiters. Today it cloaks the meddling regulations and unaudited

fraud of the ever-burgeoning EU. The idea that such an empire can orchestrate

the disciplines of the euro and still win the consent of Europe's peoples is

absurd. Democratic deficits cannot last long before lapsing into dictatorship or

mob rule. The history of Europe proves that people will not tolerate conquest,

whether by bullet or bureaucrat.



Angela Merkel's bankers may be powerful, but the eurozone's "troika" of

inspectors cannot hope to rule for ever. Imagine if they had their hands on

France and Spain. This German proto-empire may have been acquired, like

Britain's 18th-century one, "in a fit of absence of mind", but if there is one

achievement on which modern Europe can surely rest its case, it is that of

national democracy. There is no way the EU can supplant it through consent.



Europe is not a seamless democratic state. It is the construct of a treaty

between disparate sovereign states, all in varying degrees of revolt against it.

As Merkel's careful courtship of David Cameron shows, his domestic travails over

Europe are not his alone. Every European government is looking over its shoulder

at a soaring scepticism, some sincere, some undeniably sinister. Even a majority

of Germans are now anti-EU, and a third want the deutschmark back.



Only a constitutional illiterate could imagine a fancy European institution

calling Brussels to account. The present EU parliament has no ministerial

responsibility, no governing party discipline and reflects no identifiable

interest, culture or "demos". MEPs represent an agglomeration of greed, voting

always for more spending. EU accountability is only to the council of ministers

and, through them, to domestic voters. We once wondered how. Now we know, from

public opinion galvanised by the toxicity of the euro - the EU's very own "poll

tax".



That said, leaders such as Cameron, Merkel and the new rulers of France and

Italy are still obliged to lead. The introduction of the euro may have led to a

true parting of ways, between more Europe and less Europe. But even less Europe

means some Europe. If and when Barroso wakes from his dream, there must be some

reality.



Treaties are not for ever, but nation states are. Those that are part of Europe

must deal with each other. They must discipline their commerce in the widest

sense, or they will lapse back into tit-for-tat duties, retaliatory embargos,

cod wars, border controls and beggar-thy-neighbourliness. Brussels may be a

parody of the Tower of Babel, but a trading bloc still needs a tower if it is to

retain competitive potency in the world.



Cameron and the sceptics therefore need to be constructive to be plausible. They

need to argue for a European Bretton Woods, to write off bad debts and

recalibrate regional economies by returning to revalued regional currencies.

They need to propose European institutions that respect national politics and

character, not just grab more power to the centre. There needs to be a sceptics'

vision of Europe.



Closer European union was an answer to war. After that it offered an answer to

communist dictatorship. In both it could claim success. Finally, at Maastricht

in 1992, it flew too near the sun. It pretended that one currency traded within

a single politico-economic space could overcome economic diversity and yield a

common wealth. It overreached itself. In refusing to recognise this failure,

Barroso and his colleagues now risk jeopardising even Europe's earlier

successes.

Politics: Profile: He 'sounds like Labour' - but now Johnson's in No 10



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 19



LENGTH: 564 words





It takes a certain chutzpah for a relatively new MP to stand their ground on a

public platform with Peter Mandelson and to make the former business secretary

look slightly out of touch.



But that is exactly what Jo Johnson did when he dismissed an attempt by

Mandelson to goad him into criticising David Cameron's plans to hold a

referendum on EU membership.



Johnson, announced as the new Downing Street policy chief on Wednesday night,

sat calmly at a recent Policy Network conference at the Guildhall and never

raised his voice as he told Mandelson repeatedly that the "referendum genie" was

now out of the bottle and would never return.



Mandelson thought Johnson, one of the most pro-European Tory MPs of the 2010

intake, would echo the widespread criticisms of the prime minister's pledge to

hold an in/out referendum on Britain's EU membership.



Johnson, 41, is certainly cut from a different political cloth from the vast

majority of Eurosceptic Tories, including his older brother Boris. But the first

member of the Johnson family to secure a perch in Downing Street is a

sophisticated operator who is too canny to fall into a trap set by Mandelson.



The exchanges with one of the founders of New Labour highlight the area that

prompted many Tories to raise their eyebrows at Johnson's appointment. One Tory

said: "Jo Johnson has a cool intellect and is very civilised. But he is very

leftwing. He is very pro-European."



Even members of the shadow cabinet were surprised. One said: "When you talk to

Jo Johnson it sounds like he should be in the Labour party."



The prime minister is fully aware of Johnson's background, not least because

they share a great deal in common. Both attended Eton, though not at the same

time, and both were members of the Bullingdon club at Oxford. Johnson was a

member at the same time as his Oxford contemporary George Osborne, and looked

more self-possessed than the future chancellor in their famous Bullingdon group

photograph.



Johnson, who is particularly close to his older sister Rachel, is a strong

supporter of his more famous older brother. While they share the same

brainpower, they are contrasting characters. Johnson minimus - he is the

youngest of three brothers - appears not to have an ostentatious bone in his

body. They both married women who do not exactly hail from the Tory tribe:

Boris's wife, Marina, is a human rights lawer; Jo's wife, Amelia Gentleman, is

an award-winning Guardian writer on poverty.



Cameron has appointed Johnson because he admires the razor-sharp intellect of

the Balliol scholar who took a first in history. The most significant factor in

Johnson's favour is that he understands the challenge posed to European

countries by the emerging economies of India and China. Johnson, who served as

the Financial Times's bureau chief in Delhi, accompanied the prime minister on

his first overseas trade mission to India, in July 2010.



Johnson's writings on how to ensure Britain survives in such a competitive world

provide a mine for Tory critics of Cameron. The pro-European Business for New

Europe group, regarded with great suspicion by many Tories, provided Johnson

with £1,750 in travel and accommodation costs last April to help him research an

essay on improving links between Britain and India.

Simon Hoggart's sketch: Miliband fails to sting like a bee



BYLINE: Simon Hoggart



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 505 words





'I am," said David Cameron in response to a question about bees, "the life

patron of the Oxfordshire Beekeepers' Association!" "Resign!" yelled a Labour

voice. Possibly whoever it was imagined the PM was at last contemplating Plan

Bee. It was the only lightish moment in a dire prime minister's questions. Oh,

David Amess had a query about his 101-year-old mother wanting Cameron to bring

the EU referendum forward so she could vote. But that's the kind of gag that

amuses MPs and very few others.



How did Ed Miliband get things so wrong? It was the first PMQs for five weeks -

thanks to a long Easter holiday and Margaret Thatcher's funeral - and last time

the Labour leader had easily worsted the PM. Cameron certainly looked nervous.

The bald patch, slightly larger than before, was alarmingly low on the scalp.

And when Huw Irranca-Davies (Lab, Ogmore) asked if his dabs were all over the

rejection of Tanni Grey-Thompson to the chair of Sport England (as a disabled

person, she has had the naked effrontery to criticise the government's attitude

to disability benefits) his face went red, which is never a good sign.



So we were expecting a tremendous fight, Frasier v Ali, perhaps, or even Suarez

v Ivanovic, with both sides chewing lumps out of each other.



And there was plenty for Miliband to sink his fangs into. Another ratings agency

marks us lower than France: France, the Italy of northern Europe! Borrowing

almost imperceptibly down. Unemployment - the one proud claim the coalition

could make - back up again. And if we avoid the triple dip today, that doesn't

mean it ain't coming. Cameron should have been punch drunk, tottering round the

ring, his brain rattling round in his skull.



In fact we got the usual tedious exchange of pointless figures. Miliband had

decided to devote all his six questions to the NHS, which might play well with

focus groups, but only leads into a quagmire or meaningless claims,

counterclaims and dodgy figures. And there are so many statistics attached to

the NHS that either side can prove anything. Twelve-hour waits in A&E, said

Miliband. A&E targets breached only 15 times, said Cameron.



Miliband fought back with numbers conjured from - where? He hit out with

888,000. Cameron fought back with £3bn. Miliband talked about "one in 10

hospitals" without adequate staff; Cameron countered with 6,000 more doctors

(without actually mentioning that these had been recruited for training under

Labour). He also, as Miliband must have realised, could quote reams about the

NHS in Wales, run by Labour.



It wasn't a snarling, bruising, wrestling bout, but more like one conducted with

those giant cotton buds they used to use on the old Gladiators show. Except that

at least those knocked people down.



Immediately afterwards we heard Theresa May talk about the latest setback in her

attempt to deport Abu Qatada. This has become an obsession. If I were David

Cameron, I would say: "Calm down, dear, you have too much on your plate already.

And he is in jail! He can't do any harm to anyone! Chill!"

Front: Defence put at risk by EU poll, Germany tells Cameron: Defence put at

risk by EU poll, Cameron told



BYLINE: Nick Hopkins, Berlin

LENGTH: 737 words





Britain's standing as a leading military power with the ability to influence

events beyond its own borders will be jeopardised if the country leaves the

European Union, the German minister of defence has warned.



In an interview with the Guardian, Thomas de Maiziere insisted the defence

implications for Britain, Europe and Nato would be profound, and said this was

an aspect of the argument David Cameron did not appear to have recognised.



"This is not mentioned by David Cameron in our discussions, but for us

especially, it is important," said De Maiziere, who is a close political ally of

the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.



"If Great Britain leaves the EU, it would be a great disappointment to us. It

would weaken Nato, it would weaken the British influence within Nato. I think

from a military point of view the disadvantages for Great Britain would be

bigger than the advantages."



De Maiziere said he knew he was intervening in a domestic debate, but argued it

was too important to stand to one side, particularly with the potential military

consequences for the UK's standing in the world.



"I am not talking about economic issues or social issues, or whether you drive

on the left or the right side of the road, I am talking about security. I am

talking about British influence beyond its own borders. I think it is part of

the British tradition that Britain has to play a role in the world. Outside the

EU it would not lose a role, but it would reduce their own influence and this

cannot be in the interests of Great Britain.



"We in Germany would lose a strong partner for a pro-Atlantic co-operation with

America and a pragmatic British way to deal with security issues."



Under pressure from Eurosceptics in his own party, and with Ukip support

growing, Cameron has promised a simple in-out referendum on membership of the EU

if the Conservatives win the next election.



During the announcement in January, the prime minister warned that

disillusionment with the EU was at an "all-time high", and said he wanted to

renegotiate Britain's role in the EU before he could pledge his support for

staying in. Germany and France have said the UK cannot cherrypick its

membership, and De Maiziere made it clear that Berlin needed strong UK support

within the EU to counter French hopes of weakening Nato at the expense of

Brussels.



"France has asked us to take more lead within the EU on defence. France is not

in favour of a stronger role for Nato. The UK is just the opposite," he said.



Germany has also been irked by public demands from the UK and the US for Berlin

to spend more money on its military, to bolster Nato's defences at a time when

Washington has made Asia its priority.



De Maiziere, 59, made it clear he was not minded to take advice from countries

that were cutting their defence budgets; the UK slashed defence spending by 8%

in the 2010 strategic defence and security review (SDSR), which led to 60,000

civilian and military job losses, and the loss of equipment such as the aircraft

carrier Ark Royal and the entire fleet of Harrier jump jets.



"For the last five years, the German defence budget has been quite stable.

Nearly no reduction, and in the future it will remain stable. This is nearly

unique in Europe," he said. "Of the bigger countries, only Poland is in a

similar position. I see reductions in Great Britain and France. I am not

criticising that. There are good reasons for that. But if we keep the line, and

they don't, I would like to learn the (reasons why) you hear sometimes we should

have more commitments than they themselves. I am speaking frankly."



De Maiziere said other European countries looked to Germany to take a lead in

economic and military matters, but then balked at the way Berlin wanted to do

things. "In the euro (banking) crisis, when some countries call for German

leadership, they mean Germany should pay more. They criticise us when we say

leadership means we, Europe, shouldn't spend so much raising debts. But when we

say this, they say this perhaps is not good leadership. You can't have the cake

and eat it. When the leader only fulfils the wishes of the others, that is not

leadership."



He made clear that Germany had been urging Nato to adopt a counter-insurgency

strategy in Afghanistan long before it was finally adopted, but had been sneered

at for suggesting the military approach could not work on its own.

National: Europe: Business chiefs urge 'new deal' for Britain



BYLINE: Rajeev Syal



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 12



LENGTH: 225 words





Five hundred British business leaders, including Ocado chairman Sir Stuart Rose

and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have backed a campaign urging David Cameron to

negotiate a new deal for the UK with Brussels.



The Business for Britain campaign, whose supporters range from blue chip firms

to small companies, has backed the prime minister's approach to renegotiation

and called for a cross-party "national drive to renegotiate the terms of

Britain's membership of the EU".



Cameron has pledged to claw back powers and then offer voters a choice of

staying in the EU in a referendum by the end of 2017, if the Conservatives are

returned to power at the next election.



Business for Britain's co-chairman Alan Halsall, who is also the head of

Yorkshire pram-making firm Silver Cross, said: "Business for Britain has been

formed because many would have you believe that business doesn't want

politicians to try and renegotiate a better deal from Europe."



Retailer JML's founder John Mills, a Labour supporter, said: "This campaign is

not about taking political sides or backing the right horse - it's about doing

what's best for British business.



Other signatories include Lord Bilimoria from Cobra beer, Richard Burrows from

British American Tobacco, hairstylist John Freida, Lord Harris from Carpetright,

Moni Varma, the rice tycoon and John Clement from Littlewoods.

Dame Marjorie Scardino, the first woman chief executive of a FTSE 100 company,

has said she believes the UK business community will ultimately back the

European Union in any referendum on Britain's membership.



Scardino, who was chief executive of Financial Times and Penguin owner Pearson

for 16 years until the end of 2012, said she thought business leaders were

intelligent enough to know where their best interests lay, which was in closer

European integration - even though her faith in the British business community

generally was "at a nadir".



"I think they will be for Europe in the end. I think the business community is

smart enough to realise that just having a trade union is not enough," she said.

"They are smart enough to know they need to be part of a union that has

political and financial power."



In January, David Cameron announced that if the Conservatives won the next

election, they would hold an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU

before the end of 2017.



The prime minister also said that before that he would be seeking a new

settlement between the UK and Brussels, through a full treaty renegotiation or

other means, to repatriate powers to Britain, and that he wants the EU to

abandon its commitment to "ever closer union".



Scardino made the comments on the EU referendum during a question and answer

session after delivering the 2013 Hugo Young lecture in London on Tuesday

evening.



In her speech, she said she thought Young, the pro-European former Guardian

political columnist who died in 2003, would "likely have scolded the government

for pandering to Ukip".



Scardino, who was born and raised in Texas but has lived in the UK for 20 years,

also said the EU was in need of leaders of the stature of George Washington and

Abraham Lincoln to help it through its current political and financial malaise.



In a speech that drew comparisons between the EU and the development of the US

as a political union over more than two centuries, she added that having a

single, strong leader was one of the factors that had helped her native country

survive numerous political crises that could have torn it apart, including the

civil war.



Answering a question on this point, Scardino said she thought there was a "such

a paucity of imagination among politicians and business leaders" responsible for

making decisions about the EU's political and financial future.

Michael White: A last stop at the palace where Lady T rose and fell: Last stop

at the palace for Lady Thatcher



BYLINE: Michael White



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 917 words





Margaret Thatcher arrived at the Palace of Westminster for the last time - two

minutes early - yesterday. The hearse carrying her coffin, draped in white

flowers and the union flag, glided past the regular knot of protesters on

Parliament Square, past the silent sightseers outside the abbey and into the

Peers' entrance at 2.58pm. The Methodist disciplinarian, never quite erased from

her character, would have approved.



Just before the cortege turned up, three ministers - Vince Cable, David Willetts

and Matt Hancock - dashed through the crowd into the building. Overwhelmed with

grief? Not exactly. They were voting to fend off a backbench Tory revolt against

the coalition's relaxation of home extension planning laws, a recipe for

suburban anarchy which might have tested her party loyalty.



Though modest, yesterday's was a showier appearance than Thatcher's debut here,

made after winning Finchley in the Tory election landslide of October 1959. But

not by much. Even then the former Miss Roberts, a wannabe MP since her teens,

had shown a talent for publicity and a capacity to impress despite the handicap

of her gender - one of just 25 "lady members" that year, 12 of them Tories.



"Tories Choose Beauty," the Evening Standard said when the tax barrister

mother-of-twins had beaten the chaps to a safe London seat, despite her husband

being away on business. Finchley Tories "have armed themselves with a new weapon

- a clever woman," said the more perceptive Finchley Press.



Within weeks of becoming an MP pundits were predicting "a brilliant future". "A

star is born," said the Express. The future PM's Labour pair called her

"exceptionally able, also a very nice woman". One patronising Tory MP called her

"over-bright and shiny", another said that she reminded him of one of his

constituency activists "but writ hideously large".



How things change. In 1959 Thatcher's evolving Thatcherite views were distinctly

unfashionable in Harold Macmillan's Keynesian Britain and she was smart enough

to keep them in her handbag. As for some of the rightwing Tories - not all - who

turned out for yesterday's short, simple service in the ancient Chapel of St

Mary Undercroft, they would have been among her most vocal ("should be at home

with her children") critics in the blokeish Smoking Room.



Few visitors seemed to be aware of the quiet drama in the chapel off Westminster

Hall where Charles I was tried for his life in 1649. As for the school parties,

how many of them had tweeted last week "who is Margaret Thatcher?" A Roundhead

in the Cavalier's party is one answer.



Eileen Wright, 82 and a parliamentary secretary since 1946 - yes 1946 - was not

in the crowd by chance. In the early years she used to fill in during Thatcher's

own secretary's holidays. "She was lovely. One Monday I said 'I can't stay late

tonight, I have my floral art class.' The next Monday she said 'it's your floral

art class.' I said 'no, it's only once a month.'" Frugal Thatcher also paid Mrs

Wright in porcelain pieces, not money - "taxes were so high".



At the head of the queue outside the chapel ("why are there so many police and

officials here, don't they have work to do?" Lady T might have murmured) was

Tory eager-beaver Mark Pritchard, unborn when his heroine got her first

ministerial job in 1961.



He was soon joined by Ann and Cecil Parkinson - a derailed Thatcher protege, now

the last survivor of the Falklands war cabinet. Then came Julian Lewis, one of

the day's planning rebels, and ex-MP-now-lord, Patrick Cormack.



"She was a great prime minister, though I voted against her many times," Cormack

admitted. Charles Powell, her loyal foreign policy adviser, and John Wakeham,

her Mr Fix-It, were not far behind.



The Thatcher family arrived last, Carol with what social gossips said is her

"on-off boyfriend of 20 years," a tanned and curly-haired Swiss ski instructor,

Sir Mark, an on-off many things, with his second wife and children.



They too were part of Thatcherism's collateral damage.



Margaret Thatcher never voted against a Tory government until - in the Lords -

she rebelled in 1992 over a referendum on the EU's Maastricht Treaty, the

euro-worm in the bud that still gnaws David Cameron. The PM was not present

yesterday; he will read a lesson at today's public funeral at St Paul's. "This

was a much more intimate service, very emotional," explained John Whittingdale,

another Thatcher intimate from the No 10 years. Prayers, a reading from Psalm

139, verses from St John ("I am the way, the truth and the light"). Nicholas

Soames, grandson of the last British politician to get such a sendoff, was among

those listening.



Yet Labour and the Lib Dems, represented on this Tory tribal occasion by their

chief whips, suspect the Conservatives have mismanaged the death of what the

death certificate called their "retired stateswoman". Emerging from the chapel

(completed in 1365) the rightwing Tory, Bernard Jenkin, put it more generously:

"I have gone out of my way to be nice about people who criticise her. Some scars

will never heal." Nearby tourists respectfully inspected the brass plaque in the

floor marking where Charles I fought for his throne and lost. Parliament

executed him after a public trial and due process. With her own cabinet in 1990

Margaret Thatcher was not so lucky.

Financial: UK business will vote for EU in referendum, says Scardino

US has)," she added. "The politics of Europe is unimaginative and bureaucratic."



However, Scardino said another lesson from the history of the US was that

building a union between disparate groups of people takes time, above all else.



She added that the US grew from 13 British colonies that shared a common

language and culture, where as the EU was trying to forge closer union from

countries that in some cases had been in existence for more than 1,000 years,

with "very, very long histories and very well-dug-in legacies".



"It's not about legislatures being more compromising; it's not about anything

other than time. It takes a long time to build democracy, to build freedom."



The annual Hugo Young lecture is organised by the Scott Trust, the owner of the

Guardian.

Front: Michael White: A last stop at the palace where Lady T rose and fell



BYLINE: Michael White



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 910 words





Margaret Thatcher arrived at the Palace of Westminster for the last time - two

minutes early - yesterday. The hearse carrying her coffin, draped in white

flowers and the union flag, glided past the regular knot of protesters on

Parliament Square, past the silent sightseers outside the abbey and into the

Peers' entrance at 2.58pm. The Methodist disciplinarian, never quite erased from

her character, would have approved.



Just before the cortege turned up, three ministers - Vince Cable, David Willetts

and Matt Hancock - dashed through the crowd into the building. Overwhelmed with

grief? Not exactly. They were voting to fend off a backbench Tory revolt against

the coalition's relaxation of home extension planning laws, a recipe for

suburban anarchy which might have tested her party loyalty.



Though modest, yesterday's was a showier appearance than Thatcher's debut here,

made after winning Finchley in the Tory election landslide of October 1959. But

not by much. Even then the former Miss Roberts, a wannabe MP since her teens,

had shown a talent for publicity and a capacity to impress despite the handicap

of her gender - one of just 25 "lady members" that year, 12 of them Tories.



"Tories Choose Beauty," the Evening Standard said when the tax barrister

mother-of-twins had beaten the chaps to a safe London seat, despite her husband

being away on business. Finchley Tories "have armed themselves with a new weapon

- a clever woman," said the more perceptive Finchley Press.



Within weeks of becoming an MP pundits were predicting "a brilliant future". "A

star is born," said the Express. The future PM's Labour pair called her

"exceptionally able, also a very nice woman". One patronising Tory MP called her

"over-bright and shiny", another said that she reminded him of one of his

constituency activists "but writ hideously large".



How things change. In 1959 Thatcher's evolving Thatcherite views were distinctly

unfashionable in Harold Macmillan's Keynesian Britain and she was smart enough

to keep them in her handbag. As for some of the rightwing Tories - not all - who

turned out for yesterday's short, simple service in the ancient Chapel of St

Mary Undercroft, they would have been among her most vocal ("should be at home

with her children") critics in the blokeish Smoking Room.



Few visitors seemed to be aware of the quiet drama in the chapel off Westminster

Hall where Charles I was tried for his life in 1649. As for the school parties,

how many of them had tweeted last week "who is Margaret Thatcher?" A Roundhead

in the Cavalier's party is one answer.



Eileen Wright, 82 and a parliamentary secretary since 1946 - yes 1946 - was not

in the crowd by chance. In the early years she used to fill in during Thatcher's

own secretary's holidays. "She was lovely. One Monday I said 'I can't stay late

tonight, I have my floral art class.' The next Monday she said 'it's your floral

art class.' I said 'no, it's only once a month.'" Frugal Thatcher also paid Mrs

Wright in porcelain pieces, not money - "taxes were so high".



At the head of the queue outside the chapel ("why are there so many police and

officials here, don't they have work to do?" Lady T might have murmured) was

Tory eager-beaver Mark Pritchard, unborn when his heroine got her first

ministerial job in 1961.



He was soon joined by Ann and Cecil Parkinson - a derailed Thatcher protege, now

the last survivor of the Falklands war cabinet. Then came Julian Lewis, one of

the day's planning rebels, and ex-MP-now-lord, Patrick Cormack.



"She was a great prime minister, though I voted against her many times," Cormack

admitted. Charles Powell, her loyal foreign policy adviser, and John Wakeham,

her Mr Fix-It, were not far behind.



The Thatcher family arrived last, Carol with what social gossips said is her

"on-off boyfriend of 20 years," a tanned and curly-haired Swiss ski instructor,

Sir Mark, an on-off many things, with his second wife and children.



They too were part of Thatcherism's collateral damage.



Margaret Thatcher never voted against a Tory government until - in the Lords -

she rebelled in 1992 over a referendum on the EU's Maastricht Treaty, the

euro-worm in the bud that still gnaws David Cameron. The PM was not present

yesterday; he will read a lesson at today's public funeral at St Paul's. "This

was a much more intimate service, very emotional," explained John Whittingdale,

another Thatcher intimate from the No 10 years. Prayers, a reading from Psalm

139, verses from St John ("I am the way, the truth and the light"). Nicholas

Soames, grandson of the last British politician to get such a sendoff, was among

those listening.



Yet Labour and the Lib Dems, represented on this Tory tribal occasion by their

chief whips, suspect the Conservatives have mismanaged the death of what the

death certificate called their "retired stateswoman". Emerging from the chapel

(completed in 1365) the rightwing Tory, Bernard Jenkin, put it more generously:

"I have gone out of my way to be nice about people who criticise her. Some scars

will never heal." Nearby tourists respectfully inspected the brass plaque in the

floor marking where Charles I fought for his throne and lost. Parliament

executed him after a public trial and due process. With her own cabinet in 1990

Margaret Thatcher was not so lucky.

National: Eurosceptics open to compromise on reforms, says Tory MP



BYLINE: Andrew Sparrow, Political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 11



LENGTH: 447 words





A leading Conservative MP said Eurosceptics in the party were willing to

compromise over their demands for EU reform as David Cameron flew to Berlin to

discuss them with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.



Andrea Leadsom, the MP who heads the Fresh Start Group, which has drawn up a

detailed manifesto for the repatriation of powers to the UK, said that there was

no one in the party who wanted Cameron to "lay down the law" to Britain's EU

partners and that compromise was essential.



Cameron has also been adopting a conciliatory, rather than a confrontational

tone, stressing that the proposals he set out in his Bloomberg speech on Britain

and Europe in January are for the benefit of the EU as a whole, and not just to

appease the demands of British Eurosceptics.



Cameron flew to Berlin with his wife Samantha and their three children after

Merkel, in an unusual move, invited his entire family to stay.



The two leaders were due to attend an informal dinner last night, followed by

more formal talks today covering EU reform, the eurozone, Syria and the agenda

for this summer's G8 summit.



In his Bloomberg speech, Cameron committed himself to change Britain's

relationship with the EU if he wins the 2015 election and then hold an in/out

referendum by the end of 2017 at the latest.



His call for powers to be repatriated to London got a frosty reception across

much of Europe and, with Cameron holding open the possibility of recommending a

no vote in the referendum in the event of his failure to secure a satisfactory

renegotiation, Labour described the speech as the first step in a process that

could lead to Britain leaving the EU.



But now Cameron is trying to cast himself as the architect of pan-European

reform. In a joint interview with European newspapers earlier in the week, he

said his proposals were a benefit to the EU as a whole. "What I want to do is

achieve a reform of the European Union," he said.



"We're in a global race where we have to compete with (countries such as) India,

China, Indonesia and Malaysia. We need a Europe that is more open, that is more

competitive, that is more flexible, that thinks more about the cost that it's

putting on businesses, particularly small businesses. That is the aim."



Leadsom, who was been canvassing support in other EU states for the Fresh Start

proposals, said yesterday that Tory Eurosceptics accepted that compromise would

be necessary as talks about the future of Europe get under way.



"I don't think anybody on the backbenches or the frontbenches of any party

thinks laying down the law is at all possible or plausible or desirable," she

said.

Obituary: Lady Thatcher: Britain's first female prime minister who during her

three terms in office proved to be a dominant but divisive force in politics



BYLINE: Anne Perkins



SECTION: GUARDIAN OBITUARIES PAGES; Pg. 32



LENGTH: 3976 words





Margaret Thatcher, who has died aged 87, was a political phenomenon. She was the

first woman elected to lead a major western power; the longest serving British

prime minister for 150 years; the most dominant and the most divisive force in

British politics in the second half of the 20th century. She was also a global

figure, a star in the US, a heroine in the former Soviet republics of central

Europe, a point of reference for politicians in France, Germany, Italy and

Spain.



In Britain, the Thatcher years were a watershed. After them, the ideals of

collective effort, full employment and a managed economy - all tarnished by the

recurring crises of the 1970s - were discredited in the popular imagination.

They were replaced with the politics of me and mine, deregulation of the markets

and privatisation of the state's assets that echoed growing individual

prosperity. Thatcher did not cause these changes, but she legitimised and

embedded them. Her belief in the moral authority of the individual and the

imperative of freedom of choice led left as well as right to reappraise the

welfare state. Her perception of economics, society and Britain's place in the

world continue to shape British politics.



It is often claimed that she gave no warning of the revolution she was about to

unleash when she won her first majority in 1979. In fact, although the official

manifesto was opaque, her speeches in the years between defeating Edward Heath

for the leadership of the Conservative party in 1975 and coming to power laid

out the ideology that underpinned her policies over the next 11 years.



Thatcher was pragmatic about her methods but constant in her targets: socialism,

the Labour party and above all the collectivist state that Labour, abetted by

one-nation postwar Conservatism, had constructed. She believed that the state

was a burden on private enterprise. Its cost was crippling the economy and

overloading it with debt. Vested interest had been allowed to flourish, most

notably in the trade unions but also in the nationalised industries of coal,

steel and telecommunications.



Many others shared her analysis. The strength of her beliefs gave her the

courage to push on where others might have conciliated. She came to ignore

criticism with a ruthlessness that was in the end her undoing.



She was not the only person who saw a world divided between good and evil. What

marked her out was a willingness to say so, abroad as well as at home. Soviet

leaders, after years of detente, were startled to find their regime denounced as

the embodiment of inhumanity, bent on military expansion. Before she had won a

general election vote in the UK, Thatcher had won the sobriquet overseas of the

Iron Lady.



Only an outsider could have given birth to an ideology as iconoclastic as

Thatcherism, and Thatcher always regarded herself as a challenger of the status

quo, a rebel leader against established power. What mattered to her was less the

breadth of her support than the depth of her convictions.



In time, there grew around her a mythology that rooted her absolute faith in the

individual in her upbringing above the grocer's shop in the Lincoln-shire town

of Grantham. She was the second of two daughters of Alderman Alfred Roberts and

his wife, Beatrice. The two girls were educated at Kesteven and Grantham girls'

school, and at 17 Margaret won a place to study chemistry at Somerville College,

Oxford, where she was tutored by the future Nobel prizewinner Dorothy Hodgkin

(with whom she remained on respectful terms, despite Hodgkin's passionate

opposition to nuclear weapons). She graduated in 1947.



Less than two years later she was selected to contest the hopeless Kent seat of

Dartford, despite the reservations of some party activists who were appalled at

the prospect of a 23-year-old woman as their candidate. She contested Dartford

in both the 1950 and 1951 general elections.



It was at a social function after her first adoption meeting that she met Denis

Thatcher, a businessman with a passion for rugby who had earlier rejected the

chance of fighting the seat himself. Denis drove the candidate back to London.

Well-off, divorced and amiable, Denis ran his family paint firm, which was later

absorbed into Burmah Oil. They were married in December 1951. In 1953, their

twins, Mark and Carol, were born. Denis, it was claimed, spent the day at a

cricket match - Carol later called their marriage "a partnership of parallel

lives" - and while still in the maternity hospital, Margaret signed up to study

for her bar finals. She was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1954.



For a young woman with a new family, to become an MP was unprecedented. But in

1958, she was selected for the rock-solid north London constituency of Finchley,

the seat she represented from October 1959 until she retired at the general

election in 1992.



In October 1961, after only 20 months on the backbenches, the then prime

minister, Harold Macmillan, made Thatcher a junior pensions minister (a job she

later gave to her own successor, John Major). It would be nearly 30 years before

she returned to the backbenches. In 1967, with her party in opposition, she was

promoted to the shadow cabinet by the new party leader, Heath, and when he won

the election of June 1970, she became education secretary, the only woman in the

cabinet.



Here, her public reputation was made as "Thatcher the milk-snatcher", the

minister who cut spending by ending universal free milk for primary school

children. It was a defining moment, but also a rare breach of the Conservatives'

unwillingness to disturb the postwar consensus. Much more in keeping was her

continuation of Labour's plan to replace grammar schools with comprehensives.



But she was at the ringside as Heath's experiments in monetarism and industrial

relations legislation crashed and burned. Heath resumed the interventionist

policies of the 1950s. In February 1974, as a miners' overtime ban prompted

power cuts and the introduction of a three-day working week, Heath asked: "Who

governs Britain?" He lost the general election. Thatcher later claimed she had

always been uncomfortable with Heath's consensual approach. At the time,

however, she was silent and loyal.



However, after Harold Wilson narrowly won a second election victory in October

1974, Thatcher was among the embryonic new right preparing to challenge Heath.

Its intellectual leader was Keith Joseph, but his chance of leading the party

vanished with a notorious speech, claiming that the poor had too many children.

Thatcher decided she would put her name forward for the contest. "Someone who

represents our viewpoint has to stand," she told Joseph. Denis told her she was

out of her mind, a view echoed in every newspaper. To a party that could not

decide whether it was worse to be female or to be suburban, she appeared

entirely unelectable.



Yet she defeated Heath in the first ballot and four other contenders in the

second. The beaten favourites included William Whitelaw, the man who was later

her indispensable deputy. She won in an ambush that capitalised on discontent

with Heath rather than positive enthusiasm for her. As a result, she was never

sure of her party: "Is he one of us?" became the defining question of the next

11 years. Many of her backbench colleagues shared the prevailing view in the

Labour government that Thatcher's leadership made the Tories unelectable. She

worked assiduously to meet a barrage of criticism - criticisms that often

focused as much on attributes of gender as on matters of policy. Her hair, her

clothes and particularly her voice were attacked. Politics remained a largely

male preserve, about the strength to confront, whether it was trade union power,

economic crisis or Soviet threat.



Thatcher's only cabinet-level experience had been in a relative backwater. She

had always conformed to the norms of a woman in public life. Engaged in

discourse largely with men, she observed the conventions, flirted, sometimes

shouted and occasionally wept. Her advisers emphasised the feminine, softened

her appearance and lowered her voice. Yet she was always most authentic when she

was defiant. If a single phrase captured her political identity, it was from her

1980 party conference speech: "This lady's not for turning." She played by the

rules that demanded that she present herself as soft and yielding, but by her

diligent attention to detail, the concentration of her focus, and her appetite

for conflict, ultimately she subverted them.



Thatcher drew up a new settlement with the welfare state, and organised labour

and the City in a way that rewarded enterprise and individual effort over the

collective and the communitarian. She regarded group interests, from trade

unions to the professions, as protectors of privilege.



Although monetarism had already been forced upon the preceding Labour government

by the International Monetary Fund, under Thatcher it was presented as a

crusade, until it was discreetly abandoned in the mid-1980s.As the global slump

reached its nadir in early 1981, she and her chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, defied

all appeals for Keynesian-style reflation. In the first budget of the

administration, VAT was nearly doubled to 15% while personal taxes were slashed

- the top rate of income tax from 83% to 60%, and the standard rate from 33% to

30%. Over the next 10 years, the standard rate came down to 25%, and the top

rate to 40%. Interest rates were to be the principal method of controlling the

money supply. Removing exchange controls was the first symbolic piece of

deregulation. In September 1982, unemployment - which became the de facto weapon

against the trade unions - reached 3 million.



A series of employment acts were introduced which ended trade unions'

traditional show-of-hands votes and brought in secret pre-strike ballots as well

as decennial votes on the political levy. Wages councils were constrained. In a

second tranche of legislation in the late 1980s, the closed shop and secondary

strike action were outlawed.



Thatcher thought the government had no role to play in public sector pay

negotiations or in seeking to secure industrial peace. The steelworkers were the

first to clash, and although, in 1981, planned pit closures were aborted to

avert a miners' strike, by early 1984 the government was prepared - literally -

for what was to be the last stand of the old trade union movement in its heavy

industry heartland: the year-long showdown with the miners that culminated in

mass closures and ultimately privatisation.



Thatcher shrugged off record personal unpopularity and relished facing down her

critics. But she would not have survived without the crisis on the left which

led to the formation of the breakaway Social Democratic party. In 1981 there

were riots in Brixton, south London, Toxteth in Liverpool and Manchester's Moss

Side. From March 1984, striking miners and police were in frequent, violent

confrontation. In 1985 Brixton erupted again, and there was rioting too in the

Handsworth area of Birmingham. In the same year PC Keith Blakelock was murdered

during disturbances on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, north London.



Privatisation, which came to be a fundamental of the Thatcherite mission, was

only hinted at in 1979, and in the depression of the early 1980s caution

prevailed. When the ailing nationalised motor manufacturer British Leyland ran

into trouble in early 1980, Joseph, then Thatcher's industry minister, bailed it

out like a Heathite. Nonetheless, in 1980-81 more than £400m was raised from

selling shares in companies such as Ferranti and Cable and Wireless. Later came

North Sea oil (Britoil) and British Ports, and from late 1984 the major sales of

British Telecom, British Gas and British Airways, culminating at the end of the

decade in water and electricity. By this time these sales were raising more than

£5bn a year.



Conflict was at the heart of Thatcher's style. But it is a myth that she never

ducked a challenge. Ever a pragmatist, she was astute in the fights she picked.

The battles during her first term, from 1979 to 1983, ranged across a

forbiddingly wide terrain and set the tone for the years to come. Not all of the

challenges were sought: the IRA was behind many of them. In August 1979 Lord

Mountbatten and 18 soldiers were murdered in separate attacks. In April 1980,

she authorised the SAS to launch their live-on-TV rescue of 19 hostages from

Iraqi-trained terrorists in the Iranian embassy siege. The following year, she

refused to intervene to prevent the deaths of Bobby Sands and nine other

republican hunger strikers in the Maze prison in Northern Ireland.



The IRA's mainland bombing campaign that ensued added to the impression of a

government under siege. Airey Neave, who had run Thatcher's leadership campaign,

had been assassinated by the Irish National Liberation Army just before the 1979

election. She lost another intimate, Ian Gow, at the hands of the IRA 10 years

later. On 12 October 1984 the Provisionals' campaign nearly claimed Thatcher

herself. Five people died in the bombing of the Grand hotel during the

Conservative party conference in Brighton. Others, including the cabinet

ministers Norman Tebbit and John Wakeham, were seriously injured.



The prime minister responded with resilience. Betraying no sign of shock, she

delivered her speech to the conference later the same day, as planned. She was

already negotiating with Dublin what was to become a year later the Anglo-Irish

agreement, an attempt to improve security co-operation for which she faced down

her Ulster Unionist friends and conceded the acceptance of an Irish dimension in

the affairs of Northern Ireland. She did not seek a settlement, but with

hindsight the agreement can be read as a major step in the peace process.



The conflict with which she was most closely identified, and the one that

arguably rescued her from being just a one-term wonder, was the Falklands war.

On 2 April 1982, General Leopoldo Galtieri invaded the islands in the South

Atlantic. Discussions about a leaseback and the removal of a naval patrol vessel

had been misread as a sign that Britain was ready to abandon its distant colony.

Thatcher, ignoring the initial advice given to her by much of her cabinet - and

inspired by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Henry Leach - took the extraordinary

risk of dispatching a taskforce to retake the islands. While negotiations for a

peaceful outcome stuttered on through the US secretary of state, Alexander Haig,

the Royal Navy steamed south. On 21 May the British landed and on 14 June the

Argentinians surrendered. Less than a year later, the Conservatives were

returned with a majority of 144 over a divided opposition.



Thatcher's years in office were bookended by two defining events of global

significance. On Christmas Day 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Ten

years later, the Berlin Wall came down, heralding the collapse of the Soviet

empire. The invasion of Afghanistan reinforced Thatcher's belief in the

expansionist intent of the Soviet empire. She became the evangelist for

America's ambition to upgrade its own and Nato's nuclear defences with Cruise

and Pershing missiles. In 1980 she announced Cruise would come to Britain. As a

result, the perimeter fence around the RAF base at Greenham Common, Berkshire,

became the centre for a decade of anti-nuclear campaigning by women's groups.

She negotiated to upgrade Britain's independent nuclear deterrent by acquiring

Trident II, at a cost of £7.5bn.



Yet for all the attention to hardware, Thatcher always believed its citizens

would be the ones to destroy the Soviet empire. Visiting the Berlin Wall in

1982, she prophesied that it would be brought down by the "anger and frustration

of the people". She promoted co-operation and fostered relations with Poland and

Hungary, encouraging their leaders to imagine a world after communism. At the

same time, she sought out modernisers in the Soviet Union and brought Mikhail

Gorbachev, when he was still a relatively minor figure in the Politburo, to the

attention of Ronald Reagan as a man "to do business with". She made a triumphant

visit to Russia in 1987 where she was mobbed by the public and took the argument

against communism direct to live television, "as if she was fighting a

byelection in Moscow North," this paper's correspondent wrote. If her subsequent

reluctance to accept German reunification suggests her belief in the people was

less deep-rooted than she would claim, she was a leading force in undermining

the power of the Soviet Union.



In her battle against communism, she marched in step with the US. She and Reagan

were in particular sympathy (sorely tested when, in October 1983, the US invaded

the Caribbean island of Grenada, a Commonwealth member), although she disagreed

strongly with his dream of major nuclear disarmament. That, she considered, was

a threat to European security.



The Westland affair early in 1986 marked the beginnings of Thatcher's break with

Europe. She preferred to see the ailing British helicopter company merge with

the American Sikorsky rather than accept the European solution that her defence

secretary and leading critic, Michael Heseltine, had wanted. He resigned. In the

ensuing row, Thatcher came close to being implicated in the deliberate

discrediting of her rival. Her protege, the trade secretary Leon Brittan, was

forced to resign. Her pro-Americanism was sealed in April 1986 by her support,

alone in Europe, for the US bombing raid on Libya.



Thatcher had originally been a supporter of Britain's membership of the Common

Market and Labour's complete rejection of it after the successful referendum in

1975 only strengthened its appeal to her. However, she was elected in 1979 on a

promise to seek a budget rebate, a preoccupation that dogged every summit for

her first five years until she reluctantly agreed a settlement at Fontainebleau

in 1984.



A period of relative calm, during which Thatcher advocated speeding up the

single market negotiations followed, until the passage of the Single European

Act in 1987. At that point, she realised that her ideal of Europe as a trading

partner, a market for British goods and services where remaining trade barriers

would wither away, was at odds with the vision of closer political integration

shared by the European commission president, Jacques Delors, and most other

European nations. Her battles against it became one of the deadly fissures in

her relations with her cabinet.



It is one of the paradoxes of an era that will be remembered for its hostility

to the EU that in the Single European Act (which led to the Maastricht treaty),

Thatcher ceded more control over British affairs than any prime minister before,

while in sponsoring the Channel tunnel, she established a permanent land route

to the continent.



In 1988, she made a speech in Bruges attacking "creeping Euro-federalism".

Throughout the following year, her chancellor, Nigel Lawson, fought for a date

for sterling to join the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), to which the UK was

committed and which would allow interest rates to fall. Thatcher was determined

that the value of the pound should not be pegged to European currencies.

Protesting at the influence of the economist Alan Walters as a rival centre of

advice, Lawson resigned.



Thatcher's desire to build a free-market Europe was matched by her attempt to

strengthen the role of the individual against the state at home. The election of

June 1987 produced another landslide, her third election victory. It heralded a

programme of radical public sector reform intended to assert the power of the

consumer and bring market discipline into schools and hospitals.



The 1988 Education Act brought in city technology colleges and grant-maintained

schools, free of local authority control. Housing action trusts further limited

local councils' room for manoeuvre. A purchaser-provider split was introduced

into the NHS. The rhetoric of public spending cuts continued, although the

records show that public spending rose every year in her time in office,

declining only as a share of GDP.



Local councils, particularly Ken Livingstone's Greater London council, were

among Thatcher's most effective critics. Her response was the poll tax, properly

known as the community charge, levied on an individual basis that would link

council spending to local taxes. She ignored advice that such a tax would be

impossible to collect and that it was also severely regressive. In March 1990

there were protests and riots in a mass rejection of an unjust tax.



Meanwhile the party splits over Europe were reaching a climax. Geoffrey Howe, an

early and loyal Thatcherite, had supported Lawson over Britain's membership of

the ERM. Only the threat of their resignation had forced her to agree to join.

In revenge, Howe was sacked as foreign secretary and made leader of the House

and deputy prime minister. In October 1990, as Thatcher stood at the dispatch

box after the Rome summit (where she had been ambushed with demands for further

integration) dismissing, it seemed, any progress at all with "No! No! No!", Howe

finally resolved to resign.



The defiance that had once so impressed her party, and many in the country, now

sounded dangerously deluded even to some of her closest supporters, especially

those in marginal seats. It took less than 10 days - from 13 November when Howe

made his resignation speech to 22 November when Thatcher announced her

resignation - for Conservative MPs to eject her.



At the 1992 election, Thatcher retired from the Commons and took a seat in the

Lords. Powerfully affected by a sense of injustice, she found it hard to desert

the field of domestic politics. Her only consolation was that in ensuring the

accession for her favourite, Major, she denied it to Heseltine. But she was soon

letting it be known that Major was not, after all, one of us. After his defeat

in May 1997, his successors - with the exception of Iain Duncan Smith - were

found to be disappointments too.



The first of her two volumes of memoirs, The Downing Street Years, appeared in

1993, followed two years later by The Path to Power. She also established the

Thatcher Foundation, which, funded by the large fees she could command for

public speaking in the US and Japan, was intended to promote her ideas, not

least in the emerging democracies of eastern Europe. In March 2002, after a

series of minor strokes, she gave up public speaking.



Thatcher broke the pattern of postwar politics and changed its nature. Labour

accommodated rather than reversed her attack on the welfare state and left her

employment legislation almost untouched. When the Conservatives finally returned

to power in May 2010, in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, David Cameron and

George Osborne shared her priorities and used her language. So complete, it

seems, was her undermining of the role of the state that even the catastrophic

failure of deregulated markets has yet to trigger a reappraisal.



It is a paradox of her period in office that, while seeking to limit the scope

Comment: Hollande is losing the battle for the eurozone: The president's woes

matter outside France. The failure of his anti-austerity pledge has left the

balance of power with Germany



BYLINE: Jonathan Fenby



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 26

It is just 11 months since France elected Francois Hollande as its first

Socialist president since 1995, spurring a wave of expectation on the European

left that he would lead a pro-growth offensive against the cheerleaders of

austerity. When his party and its allies won an absolute majority in the

national assembly, it seemed Europe might be acquiring a real challenger to the

Berlin-Brussels-London consensus.



It has not turned out like that, of course, evoking inevitable reminders of the

last Socialist presidency, that of Francois Mitterrand. He came to office in

1981 on a reflationary platform declaring that there was nothing wrong with

dreaming; the trouble was that waking up proved very jarring, as the Hollande

administration is now discovering.



Growth under the would-be expansionary champion has not risen; in fact, it has

positively slumped. Finance minister Pierre Moscovici says it might total 0.1%

this year compared with the official forecast of 0.8%. The economy contracted by

0.3% in the last quarter of 2012. France will miss the target of reducing its

deficit to 3% of national output in 2013. Unemployment is at 10.6%, and much

higher among young people.



France has been running a monthly trade deficit of euros 5 billion and its

falling competitiveness in costs is widely acknowledged. The structural reforms

the economy needs have been held back by vested interests, largely in the public

sector. Hollande is the first president of the Fifth Republic who is a creature

of his own party rather than its progenitor, limiting his authority, while his

attempt to be a "normal" president sits ill with the quasi-monarchical character

of the post crafted by Charles de Gaulle.



What's more, the political crisis that has blown up over a former French budget

minister's secret foreign bank deposits, and the revelation by the Guardian and

other newspapers that Hollande's presidential campaign treasurer has off-shore

accounts in the Cayman Islands, gave the head of state his toughest test to

date, exacerbated by his harping on the evils of money.



Already scoring the lowest opinion poll ratings of any president (27% in the

latest survey), Hollande seems caught in a downward spiral. In a big television

interview last week, he was earnest and spoke sense, but offered nothing to

galvanise a jaundiced nation. At the weekend, the Elysee palace played down talk

of a government reshuffle, but the prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, cuts a

lacklustre figure and some Socialists are calling for a referendum on public

morality. The National Front's Marine le Pen thunders about national decline and

the hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon is mobilising his troops against "an

intrinsically rotten system".



Hollande's woes matter outside France's frontiers. The way the country is

stumbling economically has shown just how hard it is for the European left to

craft policies to redress the continent. Ed Miliband is likely to be rather more

circumspect in his embrace of the beleaguered figure in the Elysee than he was

in the first flush of Hollande-mania.



That leaves the field to belt-tighteners and bond markets. The chaotic outcome

of the election in Italy reinforces this; having saved his country from a

Greece-style crisis, the prophet of austerity, Mario Monti, trailed in fourth

place, but the Socialists have been unable to form a government. The Five Star

Movement of comedian Beppe Grillo is a recipe for chaos and, incredibly, Silvio

Berlusconi still lurks on the fringes of power. The crisis of authority across

southern Europe has been exacerbated by scandal allegations against the

government in Spain while Greece remains mired in the morass of dodgy

accounting. The terms of the bailout of Cyprus introduce a whole new level of

uncertainty.



The wider effect of all this and, in particular, of Hollande's troubles, is to

reinforce Germany ahead of the federal elections in September. Berlin would

prefer not to find itself in increasingly lonely leadership. But there is

nothing Angela Merkel can do. Though her Christian Democrats have suffered

setbacks at state elections and the polls show the CDU short of an overall

majority - opening up the possibility of an alliance with the Greens against the

Social Democrats - Merkel is personally popular. She enjoys support for her

European policies. But the context is shifting.



Her country's relationship with France has provided the backbone for the

construction of Europe since the Franco-German friendship treaty signed by de

Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer in 1963, but it is now in questionable shape. Merkel

and Nicolas Sarkozy did not get on well, but the Frenchman knew better than to

get out of step with the chancellor in public. Paris and Berlin can agree on

some things, such as their rejection of David Cameron's plan for a new European

treaty to pacify his euro-sceptics. But Hollande's proclamation of a pro-growth

agenda in his election campaign widened the division; the Germans regard the

pace of French structural reforms as too slow and take a dim view of France's

sympathy for critics of austerity in southern Europe.



If Hollande had been able to set out a strong pro-growth stall there might have

been an equilibrium between the two big continental states, even if this

discomforted Merkel. But his weakness makes that a remote prospect, with no

serious alternative policies in sight to those put forward by the chancellor,

despite popular resentment at austerity and the inner contradiction of expecting

spending reductions to breed growth.



This means that a two-speed eurozone, divided between northern and southern

states, becomes more likely, with Brussels and Berlin incurring rising

unpopularity in the latter as anti-austerity election results underline the EU's

democratic deficit. France risks being caught in the middle, its heart with the

south, its economic prospects tied to the north, while Cameron's search for a

fudge on Europe increasingly irritates leaders with more serious matters on

their minds. Europe's politicians have been adept at kicking the can down the

road in this crisis, but the nature of the road is changing, abetted by the

storm swirling round the Elysee.

Cameron insists he wants to bring EU nations closer: PM 'has no shopping list'

of powers to repatriate Policy proposals would be for all of Europe



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 494 words





David Cameron will today move to win over some of his fiercest critics in Europe

when he rebrands his January speech on the future of the EU as a project for all

member states rather an attempt to set out a "shopping list" of British demands.



Amid deep suspicion across the EU at the tactics of the prime minister, who

pledged in January to hold a referendum on British membership by the end of

2017, Cameron will tell the leaders of France and Spain that his proposals are

designed to bring the EU closer to all its citizens.



The prime minister will conclude his EU diplomatic charm offensive when he stays

overnight on Friday as a guest of Angela Merkel at Schloss Meseberg, the German

equivalent of Chequers. Merkel and Francois Hollande, the French president who

will host the prime minister at the Elysee Palace in Paris tonight, showed their

unease with Cameron recently by boycotting a British exercise to assess the

impact of EU laws across Europe.



As he prepared to travel to Spain and France, the prime minister reached out to

his European critics by saying he was not looking for favourable British

treatment when he outlined plans to hold an in-out referendum. In an interview

with journalists from five EU member states - including Suddeutsche Zeitung and

Le Monde - he said he hopes his proposed reforms, including changes to the

working time directive, would apply to all member states.



Asked which policies he would like to repatriate, Cameron said: "I don't want to

give you a shopping list. I think this should be a discussion across Europe

about how we make the EU more flexible, and how we make clear that powers can

flow back to nation states as well as flow forward to the EU. So I don't want to

put a list of powers; I think it's more important to (ensure) the principles . .

. that people talked about in the past, are more clearly established."



He said other EU leaders might benefit from some of his changes as a way to

tackle unease with the EU across Europe.



His remarks were designed to address the impression that he would like to use a

revision of the Lisbon treaty to repatriate powers. Aides point out that the

word repatriation does not appear in his speech. His interview was intended to

flag up a passage in the speech where he calls for EU leaders to implement the

Laeken Declaration of 2001 which was designed to create greater transparency and

democracy in the EU. The prime minister said in that Britain would demand the

changes for itself if they were rejected by other member states.



Cameron repeats his warning that it is important to respond to falling support

for the EU in Britain. "We need to recognise that consent for Britain's

membership of the EU and all the ways that it's changed has become wafer-thin in

Britain."



Cameron will find common ground with Hollande today, making clear Britain will

call for the EU arms embargo to be amended, allowing weapons to the Syrian

opposition. Germany is a supporter of the embargo.

Analysis: Cyprus is not an exception - the eurozone needs unity: Other

beleaguered nations have been quick to proclaim how different they are from the

troubled island. They're not, writes Larry Elliott



BYLINE: Larry Elliott



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 21



LENGTH: 1118 words





It had all started to look promising. The US was picking up, China had avoided a

hard landing and in Japan the early signs from the new government's

anti-deflation approach were encouraging. Even in Britain, the first couple of

months of 2013 provided some tentative hope - from the housing market and

consumer spending, mainly - that the economy might escape another year of

stagnation.



Then Cyprus came along. The last two weeks of March brought the crisis in the

eurozone back into the spotlight, and by the end of the month the story was no

longer rising share prices on Wall Street on the back of strong corporate

profitability or the better prospects for Japanese growth. It was, simply, which

country in the eurozone would be the next to require a bailout.



The past few days have seen what Nick Parsons, of National Australia Bank, has

called the "reverse Spartacus" effect, after the scene at the end of Stanley

Kubrick's epic in which captured slaves are offered clemency if they identify

the rebel leader. All refuse.



In the aftermath of Cyprus, it has been a case of "I'm not Spartacus". Four

members of the eurozone felt the need to issue statements explaining why they

were different from the troubled island. We now know that Portugal is not

Spartacus, Greece is not Spartacus, Malta is not Spartacus and Luxembourg, which

has the highest ratio of bank deposits to GDP in the eurozone, is not Spartacus.

As Parsons noted wryly, Italy was unable to say it was not Spartacus because it

still doesn't have a government to speak on its behalf. Otherwise it would

probably have done so.



Few of the independent voices in the financial markets take such attempts at

reassurance seriously. Another crisis in the eurozone could be avoided, but only

if those in charge (sic) act more speedily and effectively than they have in the

past. As things stand, another outbreak of trouble looks inevitable.



Cyprus has enough money to get by for a couple of months, but by then will be

feeling the impact of a slow-motion bank run as depositors remove their money at

the rate of euros 300 (£250) a day. The economy has been crippled by the terms

of the bailout, a Carthaginian peace if ever there was one, and the country's

debt ratio is bound to explode.



Investors are already casting a wary eye over Malta, which appears to have been

the short-term beneficiary of capital flight from Cyprus, but the bookies'

favourite for the next country to need a bailout is Slovenia, where the

government is already making contingency plans for bank losses.



By focusing on the eurozone's minnows, the markets are in danger of overlooking

a much bigger potential problem. If attempts to put together a new government in

Rome fail, Italy will be facing a second general election and in such a scenario

opinion polls currently put Silvio Berlusconi ahead.



It is not hard to sketch out a sequence of events in which Berlusconi completes

a political comeback, the markets take fright, Italian bond yields go through

the roof, the European Central Bank (ECB) under Mario Draghi says it will only

buy Italian debt if Berlusconi agrees to a package of austerity and structural

reforms, the new government refuses and then calls a referendum on Italy's

membership of the single currency. Italy has already had six consecutive

quarters of falling GDP and is on course for a seventh, making the recession the

longest since modern records began in 1960. So when Berlusconi says he cannot

let the country fall into a "recessive spiral without end", he strikes a chord.



If policymakers are alive to the threat posed by one of the six founder members

of the European Economic Community from back in 1957, they have yet to show it.

The assumptions seem to be that Cyprus is exceptional, that the ECB will ride to

the rescue if it proves not to be, and that Europe will be dragged out of the

danger zone by the pick-up in the rest of the global economy.



This is the height of foolishness. The factors causing the crisis in Cyprus are

replicated in many other member states. The ECB's "big bazooka" - buying the

bonds of struggling governments without limit - has yet to be tested, and

because Europe is the world's biggest market, the likelihood is that the

re-emergence of the sovereign debt crisis will seriously impair growth prospects

in North America and Asia.



Economists at Fathom Consulting draw a comparison between the eurozone today and

the UK at the start of the financial crisis. Mistakes were made with the

handling of Northern Rock because of fears that a bailout would create problems

of moral hazard - ie helping a bank that had got itself into trouble through its

own stupidity would encourage bad behaviour by others. The systemic risks were

not recognised, with disastrous consequences.



Similarly, the eurozone has not understood the systemic potential of the current

crisis, Fathom argues, not least the "doom loop" between fragile banks and

indebted governments. Austerity is making matters worse because cuts to public

spending and higher taxes hit economic activity by more than they reduce

government deficits. Public debt as a share of national incomes goes up, not

down.



Austerity can work, but conditions have to be right for it. It helps if a

country's trading partners are growing robustly, because then the squeeze on

domestic demand can be offset by rising exports. It helps if the central bank

can compensate for tighter fiscal policy by easing monetary policy, either

through lower interest rates or through unconventional measures such as

quantitative easing (QE). And it helps if the exchange rate can fall. Not one of

these conditions applies in the eurozone, which is why the fiscal multipliers -

the impact of tax and spending policies on growth - are so high. Put bluntly,

removing euros 1 of demand through austerity leads to the loss of more than

euros 1 in GDP.



So what should be done? Clearly, the self-defeating nature of current policy

needs to be recognised. Countries need to be given more time to put their public

finances in order. The emphasis should be shifted from headline budget deficits

to structural deficits so that some account is taken of the state of the

economic cycle, and the ECB needs to be ready with its own version of QE.



Simultaneously, work needs to speed up on creating a banking and fiscal union.

Europe could have dealt with Cyprus cheaply and painlessly had there been a

pan-European body capable of recapitalising the country's banks. Delay in

setting up such a body threatens to be costly.



Finally, the eurozone needs to start talking with one voice. A bit of "I'm

Spartacus" would not go amiss.

Cameron snubbed as Germany and France ignore UK survey on Europe: 'Balance of

competences' review gets few responses Boycott seen as indication of Tories'

isolation in EU



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 686 words





David Cameron has been dealt a major blow after Angela Merkel and Francois

Hollande snubbed a special UK exercise to assess the impact of EU laws and

regulations on Britain and the rest of Europe.



In a sign of the prime minister's growing isolation in Europe after his decision

to promise a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, Paris and

Berlin are boycotting the British "balance of competences" review.



The decision by France and Germany is a particular setback to Cameron, who said

in his long-awaited speech on the EU in January that nothing should be off the

table in the review, which will examine every area of EU lawmaking.



In an attempt to show it has an open-minded approach, Britain sent letters to

the other 26 EU members asking for their thoughts on the impact of EU laws in

areas ranging from the single market to the environment. The letters, dubbed

questionnaires in Paris and Berlin, were sent after William Hague, the foreign

secretary, launched the review last July.



But France and Germany have decided to steer clear of the review because they

see it as driven by British politics. A French diplomat said: "This is a British

domestic political exercise. We have therefore decided we would not

participate."



Only a few EU countries have replied to the letters. These include Italy, run

until recently by Mario Monti's technocratic government, and Sweden, whose

centre-right prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, is Cameron's closest ally in the

EU.



The boycott by France and Germany, which went to the trouble of co-ordinating

their positions at senior levels, will disappoint Cameron, who set great store

by Merkel's guarded welcome to his speech.



Berlin's decision to ignore the British review follows a clear private warning

from Merkel that, if re-elected in September, she would grant little of

substance to Cameron in his demands for a renegotiation of the terms of

Britain's EU membership before the UK's referendum, which the prime minister has

said would be held by 2017 at the latest. Hollande has been publicly dismissive

of Cameron's speech.



The Tories plan to use the review to decide on which areas to renegotiate.

Cameron said in January: "Our balance of competences review (will) give us an

informed and objective analysis of where the EU helps and where it hampers."



Whitehall sources are putting a brave face on the snub. One senior figure said:

"It is shrug your shoulders time. We are not put-out."



A government spokesperson said: "This is intended to be an open and transparent

process so of course we have invited other EU countries to contribute, and

indeed several have along with a number of international organisations, but we

recognise others consider this an essentially domestic review and have decided

not to."



The Franco-German decision shows how Britain has become isolated in Europe. The

foreign secretary had high hopes of co-operation from across the EU for his

review when he launched the exercise in a statement to MPs. Hague said: "The

review will be an outward-facing exercise, both domestically and

internationally."



The boycott will disappoint ministers because British diplomats across the EU

have gone out of their way to stress that the exercise will be even-handed.

Civil servants will submit reports to a three-strong ministerial team chaired by

David Lidington, the Europe minister, which also includes Mark Hoban, the work

and pensions minister, and Lord Wallace of Saltaire, the Liberal Democrat whip

and European affairs academic who is the party's representative in the Foreign

Office.



The ministers are due to receive the drafts of the first six reports within

weeks. These cover the internal market, foreign policy, development and aid,

taxation, health, animal welfare and food safety.



The senior Whitehall source said: "The letters explained our approach and said

we would welcome contributions. It was important to show that this is not about

putting together a list of demands that form a path to the exit route."

Analysis: Has EU dropped sanctions against Zimbabwe too soon?: The reward for a

'peaceful' referendum may have been premature amid fears of intimidation in this

year's elections, says David Smith



BYLINE: David Smith



SECTION: GUARDIAN INTERNATIONAL PAGES; Pg. 27



LENGTH: 818 words





A leading human rights lawyer spends eight days in jail; the prime minister's

office is raided, six of his staff arrested and three computers allegedly go

missing; civil society groups warn of rising political violence and intimidation

tactics. Plus ca change in Zimbabwe.



Yet thousands of miles away that is not, apparently, how things look from

Brussels. On Monday the European Union dropped most of its sanctions against the

southern African country, the most far-reaching olive branch for more than a

decade.



This was in effect a reward for a "peaceful, successful and credible" referendum

on a new constitution and designed to encourage further progress. The EU dropped

its targeted measures against 81 officials and eight firms in Zimbabwe. Only 10

people, including President Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace, and two companies,

including the state-run Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC), remain

on the sanctions list, restricted by asset freezes and travel bans.



The move comes after years of declining political violence and slow economic

recovery under a power-sharing agreement that followed the violently disputed

2008 election. Since then, with the world's gaze diverted by the Arab spring and

African coups, Zimbabwe has dropped down the list of crises requiring urgent

attention and begun to woo tourists again. Now the incident-free referendum and

easing of sanctions appears to put the seal on the notion that the country has

more or less "normalised".



Yet the unfortunate coincidence of the referendum with the arrest of lawyer

Beatrice Mtetwa, finally released on Monday, and six members of prime minister

Morgan Tsvangirai's staff, suggests that in Zimbabwe "normal" is still a long

way from ordinary. Mtetwa warned: "It is a personal attack on all human rights

lawyers but I was just made the first example. There will be many more arrests

to follow as we near elections."



Hardliners in Mugabe's Zanu-PF party are accused of ongoing abuses. Four rights

and advocacy groups have been raided by police searching for alleged subversive

materials so far this year. Activist Okay Machisa was locked in police cells for

almost a month only for the charges to be dropped.



Analysts predict a rise in intimidation before elections this year. "It looks

somewhat incongruous to lift sanctions in the context of some of the violations

that are continuing," said Piers Pigou, Southern Africa project director of the

International Crisis Group. "It's another episode of bad timing from the EU.

They said, 'If you have a good referendum process, we'll reward you'. They could

have put it in a broader context with qualifiers. They've been clumsy in the way

they've handled this."



Emily Armistead, a lead campaigner on conflict diamonds at Global Witness, said:

"It's a relief that the EU has at least maintained sanctions against state-owned

diamond miner ZMDC. Our research shows the company is involved in off-budget

financing of the army and secret police, organisations linked to violence and

intimidation in previous elections. We remain concerned, though, that relaxing

sanctions reflects the EU's keenness to see the Zimbabwe problem 'solved' before

free and fair elections have taken place, so that it can turn its attention

elsewhere.



"Now is a critical time for EU governments to do all they can to support

Zimbabwe's full democratic transition."



However, the relaxation of sanctions is welcome news to those who believe they

have long been counter-productive, gifting Mugabe an excuse for the country's

economic troubles and a rallying point to whip up anti-western sentiment. From

this perspective, Mugabe has just lost a major propaganda tool.



David Coltart, the education minister and member of an MDC faction, said: "My

view is that sanctions have outlived their purpose and were being cynically

manipulated for political ends. Often we see that when sanctions are about to be

lifted some appalling action is taken, which may help explain the arrest of

Beatrice Mtetwa. It happens too often to be a coincidence."



The new constitution was endorsed by Zanu-PF and the MDC, so serious violence

was never likely during the referendum. The elections, which Mugabe wants in

June, are likely to be a different story. "Although things have improved

dramatically in the last four years, there are still terrible things happening

in the country and there are still hardliners doing all they can to derail the

process," warned Coltart.



Few believe the elections will be as disastrous as in 2008 when some 253 people

died, according to an MDC count. The new constitution will be in place and

Zanu-PF is seen as less united. But its hardliners may have become more adept at

using intimidation without spilling blood. And it is still hard to imagine a

scenario in which Mugabe, who has ruled for 33 years, accepts defeat and leaves

the stage gracefully. As Pigou noted: "We are far from out of the woods."

Cyprus: Markets tumble as euros 10bn bailout raises spectre of more bank raids:

Dutch finance minister suggests future eurozone bailouts could follow Cyprus

'template' with levy on deposit holders



BYLINE: Helena Smith in Nicosia, Miriam Elder in Limassol, Ian Traynor in

Brussels and Jill Treanor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 30



LENGTH: 843 words





Fears that bank accounts could be raided in any future eurozone bailouts spooked

markets yesterday, as Cypriots prepared for their banks to reopen on Thursday

for the first time in over a week following a deal to secure a euros 10bn

lifeline.



Markets took fright after the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers

indicated that the Cyprus rescue could be a template for similar situations.

Cyprus is the first of five bailouts in the eurozone where depositors have been

hit.



"What we've done last night is what I call pushing back the risks," Jeroen

Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, told Reuters and the Financial Times

after clinching an agreement for Cyprus. "If the bank can't do it, then we'll

talk to the shareholders and the bondholders, we'll ask them to contribute in

recapitalising the bank, and if necessary the uninsured deposit holders," he

said.



Bank of Cyprus and Laiki, the two largest domestic banks, will remain shut until

Thursday while the latter is split into a good and bad bank and a levy - of

potentially 40% - is imposed on accounts of more than euros 100,000.



A big percentage of those deposits belong to Russians. Yesterday the Russian

president, Vladimir Putin, said there would be a deal to rework the terms of a

euros 2.5bn loan to the Mediterranean island, which had become attractive for

its low tax regime and lax vetting laws.



Cyprus president Nicos Anastasiades made a televised address in which he

admitted that measures would be in place to stop money pouring out of the banks

when they reopen. "The central bank will implement capital controls on

transactions. I want to assure you that this will be a very temporary measure

that will gradually be relaxed," he said.



Markets were initially buoyed by news of the "painful" bailout for Cyprus,

clinched late on Sunday night following threats by the European Central Bank to

switch off liquidity to Cypriot banks, which, carried by international deposits,

had grown to eight times the euros 17bn economy.



But markets reacted badly later in the day after Dijsselbloem's remarks. As

markets tumbled, he issued a clarification insisting that bailout programmes

were "tailor-made" and that "no models or templates are used".



Nevertheless, all markets erased their early gains to close down on the day. The

FTSE 100 index lost 0.2% and the German stock market fell 0.5%. Bank shares fell

across Europe while the euro, which had nudged up through $1.30 initially, fell

back to below $1.29. US markets, which had largely shrugged off the Cypriot

problem, were also lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down over 70

points, 0.5%.



Cypriots had reacted to the agreement with European leaders with relief as it

appeared that at least deposits below euros 100,000 had been spared the levy.



In the streets and cafes of Nicosia, and on TV chat shows, the feeling was that

the country had been saved but at a price.



Interior minister Sokratis Hasiko encapsulated the mood, describing the EU

-IMF-backed bailout as the best of a bad range of choices. "We had got to the

point where we were discussing a (depositor) haircut of between 50 and 60%," he

said, adding that the Cypriot parliament's rejection of the first accord, with

its highly controversial levy on depositors big and small, had been hugely

negative for the country's banks. "So this is the best we could get."



There were warnings the impact could reach beyond Cyprus, particularly with

repercussions from Russia, where the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said:

"They are continuing to steal what has already been stolen." This was a phrase

Lenin used to answer the allegation that the Bolsheviks were thieves. Russian

officials have repeatedly compared the Cypriot bank levy to Soviet-era

expropriation.



"For sure there is anger," said Marios Cosma, head of K Treppides, a firm that

serves international clients, mainly rich Russians. "For the first time in

Europe, you have a situation where depositors are being called to 'bail in'."



While Cyprus' banking sector has exploded, other countries have even larger

banking sectors relative to GDP. Malta's and Luxembourg's banking sectors are

relatively larger, more than 20 times' GDP in the case of Luxembourg. Malta's

finance minister wrote an article in the Malta Times expressing concern about

what would happen if it encounters similar problems in the eurozone.



In Cyprus there were calls for a referendum on the bailout package. "It is

illegal and undemocratic," said Christos Tombazos, general secretary of the

Pancyprian Federation of Labour.



The Bank of Cyprus is 9.7% owned by Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian based in Monaco

whose wealth is estimated at $9.1bn according to Forbes.



One Russian oligarch, Alexander Lebedev, played down the amount he stood to lose

in Cyprus as no more than $10,000. "It's not worth talking about," he said.

National: Osborne behind gossip over May leadership bid, say Tories: Rumours

said to be effort to defuse anti-cuts stance: Home secretary accused of

furthering own ambitions



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt, Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 15



LENGTH: 826 words





George Osborne is being blamed by rightwing Conservatives for fuelling

speculation about the leadership ambitions of Theresa May as part of the

chancellor's attempt to "disable" cabinet ministers who are fighting further

spending cuts.



As backbenchers express increasing confidence that David Cameron will face a

challenge to his leadership later this summer, the home secretary will today set

out her views at a conference organised by the ConservativeHome website.



The speech by May, who has been leading calls by cabinet ministers against

further cuts to their budgets, follows a series of carefully calibrated

interventions to burnish her credentials on the right. Earlier in the week the

Daily Mail reported that the home secretary was planning to impose a financial

bond on some immigrants.



One senior Tory said: "When you are halfway through a parliament there is a

natural tendency for people to start positioning themselves. I do not

underestimate the ambitions of Theresa May."



But a leading rightwinger detected the hand of the chancellor under pressure

from the so-called national union of ministers. This group, led by the home

secretary with support from the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, is attempting

to focus future spending cuts away from departments such as the Home Office and

the Ministry of Defence. The MP said: "George is clearly encouraging speculation

about Theresa and Philip. It disables them."



May was thrust into the spotlight this week when Ed Miliband made light of her

apparent leadership ambitions during prime minister's questions when she sat

next to Hammond. The home secretary gave Miliband a thunderous look when he

said: "I am looking forward to facing her when they are in opposition."



The speculation has been prompted by a growing belief among some backbenchers,

as the Guardian revealed last weekend, that the prime minister will face a vote

of no confidence later in the summer if the chancellor fails to inspire

confidence in the budget and the Tories perform poorly in the local elections in

May.



A vote will be triggered if 46 Tory MPs write to Graham Brady, the chairman of

the backbench 1922 committee. "It is surprising how widely the unease is

spreading," one MP said.



According to today's Times, only seven percent of Conservative party members

believe Cameron can win an outright majority at the next general election.

Quoting an internal party poll the paper says three-quarters of party members

believe Labour will be in power after the 2015 election.



Tory MPs have mixed thoughts about May. She is said to be modelling herself on

John Major, who carefully and surreptitiously positioned himself to succeed

Margaret Thatcher by reaching out to the right. One MP said: "Theresa is clearly

serious about it. But she is not a leader. She is a loner. She works very hard.

She is clearly a good home secretary. But she is not a leader."



One well-placed Tory was scornful of May's "submarine" strategy, in which she

adopts a low media profile and surfaces at times of her own choosing. "It's not

much of a submarine strategy if we are all talking about it," the MP said. "I

think Theresa's submarine must have a defective sonar." Another MP thought a

telltale sign was May's decision not to dampen speculation about her leadership

intentions. The MP said: "If Theresa thought all this was ridiculous she could

say it's all daft and there is no vacancy. But nobody in her team has done

that."



Others say the speculation about May has been prompted by the tactics of her

parliamentary private secretary, George Hollingbery, who replaced Edward Timpson

when he was appointed children's minister. Hollingbery, a millionaire who has

put his north Cornwall cottage at the disposal of Cameron's family, has run a

more political operation for the home secretary.



"George has made a simple calculation," one MP said of Hollingbery, who is a

member of the executive of the 1922 committee. "He knows that the job of a home

secretary involves permanently crossing a minefield where you never know if it

is going to blow up in your face. She therefore needs to have good links with

the backbenches and will do herself no harm if she tacks to the right. George

has been instrumental in all of that because he is a little more worldly than

Edward."



Another MP said: "Is George plotting to ensure Theresa May is replacing David

Cameron? No, he is not. Is he thinking that his star could rise with Theresa's

in the future? Of course he is."



The speculation about May comes as the Tory right plans to intensify the

pressure on No 10 by demanding that the prime minister issue an immediate

challenge to the Liberal Democrats on an early EU "mandate" referendum. This

would be an initial referendum to give the prime minister a mandate to negotiate

a change in the terms of Britain's membership of the EU. This would then be

followed be a "decision" referendum.

Westminster gossip suggests Theresa May has designs on Downing Street

May boosts Tory leadership chances with approach to right



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 18



LENGTH: 508 words





Theresa May has burnished her rightwing credentials as a candidate for the

Conservative party leadership by suggesting that immigrants may be forced to pay

a cash bond if they want to travel to Britain.



As ministers jostle for position amid speculation that David Cameron could face

a leadership challenge this summer, the Daily Mail reported that May, the home

secretary, wants to impose a bond that would be refunded if immigrants do not

claim benefits.



The idea for the levy, which can be imposed on temporary immigrants under the

1999 Immigration and Asylum Act, was floated by the prime minister in a speech

in October 2011. Home Office sources told the Daily Mail the bond would be aimed

at "high-risk" individuals of "two or three nationalities".



Ministers are joking about how May is "on manoeuvres" as she prepares to

highlight her leadership credentials this weekend in a long-awaited speech to a

conference organised by the ConservativeHome website.



Her strategy is being likened to that of Sir John Major as he positioned himself

for the leadership in 1990. May will follow Major's example in making no attempt

to undermine the prime minister, but will be ready should a vacancy arise.



The Guardian reported at the weekend that rebel Tories were planning to write

letters to Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, if George

Osborne's budget on 20 March falls flat and if the Tories perform badly in May's

local elections. If 46 Tory MPs write to Brady, Cameron will face a leadership

contest.



May looked highly unamused when Labour leader Ed Miliband made light of her

ambitions at prime minister's questions after he taunted Cameron for asking him

questions. "All I can say is that it is good to see him preparing for

opposition," Miliband said. Turning to May, he added: "The home secretary shakes

her head. I am looking forward to facing her when they are in opposition."



May is being compared to Major because he was not associated with any particular

wing of the party, but was assiduous in courting the right, ensuring that he won

the support of Eurosceptics when Margaret Thatcher finally fell. The home

secretary has followed these tactics by regularly briefing rightwing newspapers

on her plans to distance Britain from the European Court of Human Rights. There

is one major difference between now and 1990: Thatcher's position was weak and

Cameron's position is relatively strong, although a significant group on the

right would like to replace him.



The speculation about May follows reports that Eurosceptic Tories are to step up

the pressure on Cameron by demanding that legislation to guarantee a referendum

on Britain's EU membership is passed before the election.



Today's Times reported that an early referendum was discussed at a private

dinner attended by Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, Liam Fox, the former

defence secretary, and David Davis, the former shadow home secretary.

Comment: Ignore the howls. If bankers leave, it would be no loss: They took home

unheard- of sums. Only in Britain do ministers dance to their tune. But public

fury cannot be defied for ever



BYLINE: Simon Jenkins



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 30



LENGTH: 918 words





The peasants are revolting across Europe. They want bankers' blood and mean to

get it. Until now, public response to the credit crunch has been one of general

bafflement and wrist-slapping. The banks persuaded the world it was all an act

of fate. As it was, they were too big to fail and their leaders too saintly to

atone for it. For four years, British banks were showered with nearly half a

trillion pounds of public and printed money. They duly recovered and stayed

rich, while everyone else went poor.



The worm has turned. The banks and government alike have failed to deliver

recovery. The people want revenge, and have found it - of all places - in the

European parliament. It has declared that EU bankers cannot get bonuses bigger

than their salaries, or twice as big if shareholders approve. This applies

wherever EU bankers work, and to any overseas banker working in the EU.



Meanwhile, a Swiss referendum now requires top executives to seek explicit

shareholder approval for their pay, with a ban on golden hellos and goodbyes.

The Netherlands is talking of a tighter 20% cap on bonuses. Even laissez-faire

Britain has seen the National Association of Pension Funds demand that boards

keep executive pay rises down to inflation.



Europe's once omnipotent banking lobby has been all but neutered by the scale of

scandal. The German government caved in to the EU parliament under pressure from

the opposition Social Democrats. This was after the Libor scandal revealed

Deutsche Bank cutting one trader's bonus by £34m, thus implying a staggering

original sum. The Swiss campaign was kicked into life by the drugs firm Novartis

giving its departing chairman a $76m gift. Some 68% of Swiss voted for the new

curb.



Only in Britain do ministers still dance to the bankers' tune. Last month RBS

executives brushed aside their state shareholder and paid themselves £600m in

bonuses after posting a £5bn loss. Loss-making Lloyds gave senior staff an extra

£365m. Money-laundering HSBC announced 78 of its London executives would take

home more than £1m each. They all say bonuses were unrelated to fines or losses,

but they always say that. George Osborne was humiliated in Brussels yesterday by

having to plead their fruitless cause.



Last year the City of London's much-heralded "shareholder spring" got nowhere.

Revolts against executive pay at WPP, Barclays, Trinity Mirror and elsewhere had

little noticeable impact. While overall pay stagnated, that of top executives

rose 12%. Opinion polls showed the public overwhelmingly hostile to top pay.

Only the government and the London mayor stand between the very rich and a

furious public. The peasants' revolt means that even British ministers cannot

defy opinion for ever.



The reality is that the banking community has allowed this thirst for revenge to

build up for over four years, and it just did not care. Ever since the 1980s and

financial deregulation, the profession took home sums of money unheard of in any

other line of work.



This had nothing to do with free markets, except within a tight group of

high-rolling traders. Modern bankers derive "economic rent" from exploiting

oligopolistic cartels in financial services, with shareholders kept at one

remove. The astronomical traders' bonuses are asymmetric returns on cash that

properly belongs to depositors and shareholders whose money bears the risk. In

any other business such bonuses would be regarded as theft from the firm.



For four years the British government - Labour and the coalition - huffed and

puffed but was too terrified of the banks to act. Regulators were suborned by

lobbyists and ministers, their offices packed with seconded bankers, and did as

they were told. They gave huge sums to the banks in the belief that this was

benefiting the demand economy. In Britain, some £400bn of cash was "pumped into

the economy" via the banks. They merely traded or hoarded it, to their ever

greater enrichment. The money vanished. A thousand pounds handed to every

British citizen would have had more impact on the economy.



Last year, as if learning nothing, the Treasury gave the banks another £80bn to

boost business and mortgage lending. This week it was predictably revealed that

lending to small businesses actually fell as result. It was like giving money to

a drunk and telling him to support his children. Never in the history of money

can policy have been so glaringly inept. The banks laughed.



No trade unions are fiercer in defending their interests than the rich

professions. As we saw this week with lawyers, cut their largesse and they

threaten to take it out on the poor, the economy, the government, everyone. The

banks howl that the bonus cap means their greed will go "offshore". This seems

exaggerated. But the EU curbs could possibly see the start of the high-rollers

moving out of over-regulated Europe towards the Americas and Asia.



This would not be wholly good news for Britain: finance has been the boom

industry of the past quarter-century. But more likely is that the more toxic

activities will go, and that is no loss. Either way, the banks have themselves

to blame. They flew their golden wings too near the sun, and rage has melted

them. They have only one plea on their side. The culture of greed in the City

was nothing to the culture of ineptitude at the Bank of England and the

Treasury. They pumped out the money. Never in British economic history can so

much have been so wasted on so fruitless a cause. And still no hint of remorse.

Front: Osborne rebuffed as Europe says it will plough ahead with limits on

bonuses



BYLINE: Ian Traynor in Brussels



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 904 words





George Osborne suffered a bruising defeat in Europe yesterday as the 26 other EU

finance ministers imposed curbs on bankers' bonuses in an unprecedented move

targeted at the UK financial services sector.



Osborne had travelled to Brussels in a vain attempt to defeat proposals outlined

last week to set a limit of a year's salary on bankers' bonuses, protecting the

status of the City and Britain's biggest industry - financial services. "I

cannot support the proposal on the table," he told the session.



But his plea was ignored and Britain was left isolated, with no other government

opposing the move - which was also supported by the European Central Bank and

the European commission.



The City is by far the EU's biggest financial centre and financial services are

a tenth of the UK economy. It is an absolute, if unspoken, rule that EU

governments never take decisions opposed by a national government if it feels

that vital interests are imperilled. Germany had invariably supported Britain on

issues of EU regulation of financial services.



It is also not yet clear if the bonus caps will apply to European bank

subsidiaries operating outside the EU or to US and other foreign banks based in

London, Frankfurt and Paris.



The "broad political support" to clamp down on bankers represents a watershed in

Britain's relations with the EU, which have seldom been in greater uncertainty

as a result of David Cameron's actions in using a veto at an EU summit, when he

demanded an overhaul of the terms of UK membership and pledged a referendum on

whether to stay in the EU if he were to win a second term in 2015.



Martin Schulz, the president of the parliament, acknowledged Britain's position

but said: "An agreement has been reached on all aspects of the legislation.

There is no possible route for one member state to block the legislation. It

would appear that one state has severe difficulties with the agreement but the

EU must press ahead and get this important legislation on the statute book."



In what looked like a move to give Osborne an opportunity to save some face,

Germany suggested a slight postponement and slight adjustment of the new regime.

The timing and some of the fine detail of how the limits are implemented are to

be renegotiated over the next three weeks. But there was no doubt that the

central decision, to clamp down on bonuses, was irreversible.



Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the single market, said the year's

salary ceiling - or payouts equal to two years' salary only if approved by a

large majority of a bank's shareholders - was set in stone. He said it was

"crystal clear" that the cap would go ahead.



Barnier rounded on the recklessness of the casino capitalism culture he blamed

for the financial crises of the past five years, arguing that bankers were being

rewarded for dangerous risk-taking, while taxpayers had to foot the bills for

their failures. "Enough. It's over," he declared.



The new regime is to apply to 8,300 banks. Barnier wished "good luck" to those

in London considering legal action to try to overturn the bonus ceilings. The

new legislation, he said, would be on "a very solid legal basis."



Session chairman, Michael Noonan of Ireland, said the meeting achieved "broad

political support" for the limits on bankers' remuneration.



Osborne came under attack from Labour for being too slow to try to counter the

new legislation and for failing to table alternative proposals over the past

couple of years. "It shouldn't take the EU to rein in excessive bonuses," said

Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor.



He accused Osborne of "failing to engage with these sensible proposals until the

very last minute. It's no wonder that in Brussels he was outnumbered 26 to 1".



Osborne had mounted a robust argument against the proposals, asserting the curbs

could have a "perverse" effect, generating steep rises in bankers' pay, breaking

the link between performance and bonuses, and making it more difficult to "claw

back" bonuses when unmerited.



Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, offered a way to soothe the

British, hoping to coax Osborne into not voting against the new rules, expected

to come into force next year. "There are a few technical issues still to be

clarified," he said. "Then I hope in the end the United Kingdom will agree."



The details still to be settled involve how the bonuses are structured, when

they are implemented, and who is subject to them. Under the existing proposal,

25% of a bonus can be made in the form of deferred payments, which are

discounted. Britain is trying to get that figure increased, perhaps to 30%.

Osborne is also seeking to delay the measures taking effect and may win a

postponement of between six and 12 months.Any changes will need to blessed by

the European parliament, which drove the new caps regime through.



The CBI said the bonus cap would hit the UK hard: "The proposals will damage the

competitiveness of the EU's financial services industry, hitting the UK

particularly hard at a time when growth should be the key priority." Britain's

powerful financial sector fears the rules will put London at a disadvantage and

provoke an exodus of major banks and staff to rival financial centres. A

spokesman for London-based Standard Chartered Bank said: "We are concerned about

it because we are a global bank and 97% of our staff are outside the EU. We are

concerned about our ability to be competitive in attracting talent."

Labour review calls for tougher rules on pay in the boardroom



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour and Ian Traynor in Brussels



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 28



LENGTH: 480 words





Labour proposes a fresh crackdown on boardroom pay in a report released today,

which comes as the chancellor faces defeat in his efforts to head off a European

cap on bankers' bonuses.



The review of short-termism in industry calls for checks to end executive pay

based on short-term profits and tax incentives to encourage long-term

investment.



The report, prepared by Sir George Cox for Labour, represents the first serious

official thinking from the party on how to address City short-termism. It also

marks a new emphasis on industrial policy.



It comes as George Osborne goes to Brussels today in what looks like a forlorn

attempt to prevent the European Union from imposing severe curbs on bankers'

bonuses in the City.



In a highly unusual defeat illustrating the UK's deepening isolation in Europe

and the reluctance of EU partners to do Britain any more favours, finance

ministers of the other 26 are expected to endorse legislation to slash "fat cat"

bonuses.



The decision to limit bonuses ordinarily to a year's salary was made last week

at negotiations between the European parliament and officials from the 27 member

states. Despite David Cameron's opposition and Osborne's pledges to contest the

deal, it appears irreversible. The UK is unable to wield a veto as the decision

can go to a qualified majority vote if necessary.



Britain has been unable to muster enough allies to block the proposal. Its

likeliest supporters, Sweden, the Netherlands and, crucially, Germany have all

come out in favour of capping bonuses.



On Sunday, the Swiss voted in a referendum for even tighter controls on bank

pay, envisaging jail terms for those who break the new rules.



The Cox report suggests that the company governance code be altered so at least

30% of executive director remuneration be paid in the form of shares that cannot

be cashed in for five years or until after the director has completed his or her

period on the board.



It proposes a ban on voting rights for shareholders who appear on the register

during a takeover bid and says measures are needed to remove the tax bias that

favours companies funding loans through debt as opposed to equity.



In an effort to encourage so-called "patient capital" the report suggests

capital gains tax on shares could be tapered in a series of yearly steps from

50% in year one to 10% after year 10. The report suggests the measure would be

revenue neutral.



The report also proposes that all major infrastructure investment, such as

airport capacity, could be taken out of party politics so that responsibility is

handed to an independent agency that is accountable to parliament but

independent of MPs.



Matthew Fell, director for competitive markets at business body CBI, said:

"There is a need to encourage a more long-term focus from investors and the

report's recognition that industrial strategy should be a cornerstone of policy

is welcome."

Comment: Finally the Lib Dems have found the fire in their belly: After

Eastleigh, Clegg must use the euphoria and prove his party is more than a

fig-leaf for the Tories' cruellest cuts



BYLINE: Polly Toynbee



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 33



LENGTH: 1096 words





Things are shifting. Watch the Westminster balance tilt now the Lib Dems' tails

are up and the wind's in their sails, all mid an excited flutter of mixed

metaphors that they have flourished at me over the last few days.



In the beginning in the rose garden they struck a feeble deal, partly out of

fear. Had David Cameron proclaimed that their intransigence on the economy left

him no choice but a return to the polls to seek a clear majority, voters might

well have given him one. That was the fear, so the Lib Dems insisted on a

fixed-term parliament to stop either side cutting and running. As his party's

fortunes plummeted, Nick Clegg's bargaining position weakened by the month - and

he has played a weak hand exceptionally badly.



But with the Tories beaten into third place in Eastleigh, see the climate change

in the coalition. Angry Tories are lashing out in a fury of failure, as the Lib

Dems bristle with demands. "Now we know our fortresses are secure," says their

president, Tim Farron, a smirk of triumph in his voice, "we can collect 25 or 30

more Tory seats." "We are stronger, organisationally and psychologically," says

the deputy leader, Simon Hughes, with a matching hint of gloat.



Their new resolve will be tested this week. Will they repair the damage of a

year ago when they nodded through the Health and Social Care Act? The mighty

medical royal colleges have combined to protest, and we wait to see if the Lib

Dems insist that the statutory regulations attached to the act are withdrawn. In

parliament Lib Dem objections were bought off with Tory assurances that there

would be no compulsory tendering out of the NHS to private companies. But

sneaked into the dense legalese of the regulations is a duty to open up all the

NHS to commercial competition. If any commissioner fails to do so, Monitor, the

regulator, will intervene.



Last time the Lib Dems were duped, but they swear they won't be now. Their

health minister, Norman Lamb, is resolute, says Baroness Jolly, leading on this

in the Lords. They need a promise to withdraw all the relevant clauses before

the Lib Dem spring conference on Friday, or an emergency motion will be tabled

and passed overwhelmingly. Farron assured me they think it "critically important

we make sure there is no privatisation of the NHS". The act will still mean a

shambolic NHS re-disorganisation shaped for commercialisation, but it would

remove the most extreme clauses.



Look where else the emboldened Lib Dems are asserting muscle. On the budget

Vince Cable says he's arguing "very, very, very strongly" for a huge increase in

capital spending on 40 projects in housing, hospitals, roads, rail and

universities. Simon Hughes agrees, demanding councils be allowed to borrow what

they like against their own assets for new building. Farron and Cable have told

the Tories not to cut benefits again in the budget. "Immoral," says Farron; cut

Trident first, says Cable.



A surprisingly public budget war is erupting among Tory ministers: they all want

austerity - but not on their turf. Osborne plans a centrepiece sweetener to ease

the soaring costs of childcare. But he wants it as a tax allowance to compensate

higher earners who lost their child benefit. The Lib Dems rightly press for it

to be channelled to low earners through childcare tax credits. The Institute for

Fiscal Studies has shown how Lib Dem insistence on raising income tax thresholds

has helped the better off far more than low earners who don't pay much, if any,

tax. We shall see if the Lib Dems stop Iain Duncan Smith disguising the dismal

effects of his policies by changing the way poverty is measured. Overall, who

gains and loses most in the budget will tell us how hard the Lib Dems fought,

and on whose side.



Cable demands international students be removed from the immigration headcount:

it's "irrational" and "potty" to raise visa barriers, causing a fall in numbers,

while xenophobic rhetoric chases them away. Nick Clegg says he'll put his foot

down on withdrawing from the EU arrest warrant: already a tax shelter, does the

UK want to become an offshore costa del crime as well? The Lib Dems call for

de-carbonisation targets to keep prices steady, encourage investment, prevent an

energy gap and hit legal climate change obligations.



Windmills? That sums up everything the Tories and their press detest about their

coalition partners. All this inflames the Tories' present mad mood. Thrashing

around in a ferment, pincered by both Lib Dems and Ukip, Cameron proclaims he

will not lurch rightwards, as he sends out his ministers to do just that - on

immigration, benefits, tax cuts and human rights. Theresa May wants to take

Britain out of the European convention on human rights. The Tory angry brigade

calls for an instant vote to abolish the Human Rights Act, and for an EU

referendum. But Simon Hughes is quick to point out that the Tories can't put

forward a bill contrary to the coalition agreement: that says any UK bill of

rights must include every ingredient of the existing Human Rights Act.



Worse still, Lord Neuberger, the supreme court president, warns that leaving the

convention would see us ejected from the UN too. What use then our investment in

Trident to keep our prized UN security council seat? Despite all the disarray of

the past two years, Cameron's chaotic crew still have to learn that a catchy

headline for their friendly press frequently collapses with perverse

consequences. Glib one-liners don't easily turn into practical policies.



Is Clegg capable of seizing the moment - or will all this euphoric

post-Eastleigh rebellion come to nothing? His mishandling of the bargain until

now leaves deep doubts. Yes, Farron says, the Lib Dems were on "a learning curve

for next time" when they rushed too fast to sign the coalition agreement. Even

so, how did Clegg fail on tuition fees, blowing away their reputation for

honesty? The AV referendum was a fiasco without Cameron's pledge of support.

Losing Lords reform was a humiliation, only just rescued by blocking the

boundary changes. Lib Dem tax cuts have not been designed to help those in most

need. Instead Clegg has let his party act as a convenient fig leaf for the

cruellest benefit cuts affecting disabled people and poor families.



The greatest dereliction of all has been Lib Dem support for failed austerity,

sending the economy into a downward spiral - in growth, living standards,

investment, sterling, exports, manufacturing and construction. Unless they win

changes now, they will have helped accelerate the great inequality.

National: Eastleigh byelection: Ukip's dream could become the Tories' worst

nightmare: As with the SDP and Labour in the 80s, the Conservatives fear that

Farage's party could split their vote in 2015 and cost them 40 seats



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour, Political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 8



LENGTH: 856 words





Ukip's surge to 28% in Eastleigh, its best ever result in a byelection, leaves

the Conservatives scrambling to assess the root causes of Ukip's popularity and

whether its cheerful amateur leader Nigel Farage truly has the potential to

deprive the oldest political machine in British politics of as many as 40 seats

in a general election.



Cameron's nightmare is that Ukip now owns the potent cocktail of EU-related

issues, including migration and wage squeeze, and so can split the Eurosceptic

right in 2015 - just as the SDP crippled Labour in the mid-80s. For the first

time in a century the Conservative party has lost monopoly control of the right.



Farage is already promising to put up 2,000 candidates in the May county council

elections. Ukip could well come first next year in the European parliament

elections, which are run on a proportional system.



Some Tories such as the former whip Michael Fabricant, in his leaked November

discussion paper, urged Cameron to recognise that the real Ukip threat rests in

"stealing votes at general election rather than posing an actual threat to take

any one seat". He argued that Ukip started to split the right at the 2010

election. "On a realistic estimate Ukip by standing and taking a mere 3-4% of

the vote, the Conservatives could lose 20 to 30 seats," Fabricant argued.



He pointed out: "In the European elections in 2009 they became the second party,

overtaking Labour and gaining 13 seats and 16.5% of the vote. Fast forward a

year to the 2010 general election, and Ukip stood in 572 seats and took 3.1% of

the popular vote."



Yesterday Fabricant emphasised that the Conservative party now had to respond.

In a series of tweets he said: "Everyone from the PM downwards must focus on the

economy, immigration, crime, Europe and not allow other side policies to

distract.



"Of course, liberal (small 'l') policies do not distract government from the

core issues, but they are seen to do so by the electorate. With Ukip clearly

announcing policies the public want to hear, we must do the same."



Ukip, as Eastleigh showed, has pretty well broken through. A longer campaign,

and Ukip could have gatecrashed Westminster. Fabricant in his November paper

said Cameron needed to respond to the Ukip threat by promising an EU referendum,

and seeking an electoral pact with Farage. Cameron did promise the referendum,

and put up a Eurosceptic candidate in Maria Hutchings - yet it gave no

protection from a Ukip surge.



Moreover, the idea of a Ukip-Con pact was yesterday ruled out, not only by

Farage but also by Michael Gove. Personal relations between Farage and Cameron

are poisonous.



Some say, "Ukip is for people who would like to vote BNP, but shop at M&S." But

the polling work done by Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative vice-chairman,

suggests something more inchoate than racism, or even anti-Europeanism. In his

influential study of Ukip voters titled They Are Thinking What We Are Thinking,

he said his research showed "discussion amongst Ukip voters and considerers was

dominated by what they saw as the twin themes of immigration and welfare, much

more than Europe.



"But many complained that migrants from within the EU and outside had changed

the character of their local area beyond recognition. Recession and austerity

brought their complaints into sharper focus ." He went on: "They do not think

mainstream politicians are willing or able to keep their promises or change

things for the better. Ukip, with its single unifying theory of what is wrong

and how to put it right, has obvious attractions for them."



In the introduction to a poll on Eastleigh published on Thursday, Ashcroft

writes: "The Ukip attraction . . . reflects a frustration with the political

class and with the way they think things are going in Britain. Our task is not

to become more like Ukip, the party of easy answers, but to be the party of

government that people want to vote for." But one greater danger for Farage is

that he will now come under less benign media scrutiny, and that can be

dangerous, as the Liberal Democrats have discovered.



Ukip make the Lib Dems look like an oasis of normality. Blogs abound describing

the obscure factional fighting and legal challenges that disfigure Ukip's

internal politics. Some of its MEPs have ended up in jail for expenses fiddles,

been expelled or, like their South East England MEP Marta Andreasen, defected to

the Tories. She described Farage as a "Stalinist dictator with a problem about

women".



Another defector, David Campbell-Bannerman, said Ukip had "become very much a

one-man band and a bit of a cult". Farage's own views, if more widely known,

might repel some voters. He writes in his autobiography that "20% of the UK's

teachers should be sacked because they are useless functionaries. Parents,

teachers and politicians have cowered away from their responsibilities."



Farage loves the limelight, and generally receives sympathetic interviews

because he is quotable and engaging, but whether he will love it as much in six

months' time is unlikely. For after Eastleigh he is now playing in the big

league.

Front: Lib Dems hold off Ukip surge in Eastleigh: Clegg's party shrugs off

scandal while Tories come third in key byelection vote



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour and Steven Morris



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 746 words





Relieved Liberal Democrats claimed a narrow victory early this morning in the

Eastleigh byelection, fending off a surge by Ukip that forced the Conservatives

into third place - putting huge pressure on David Cameron to show he has a

strategy to win the 2015 election.



The Liberal Democrat candidate Mike Thornton won the seat with a majority of

1,771, taking 13,342 votes to Ukip's 11,571.



The Tories' candidate Maria Hutchings came in third with 10,559. Labour's John

O'Farrell came fourth with 4,088. Turnout was 52.8 %.



Nick Clegg, facing growing questions over his own leadership, will regard it as

a stunning triumph that his party survived against the backdrop of the previous

Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne resigning and now facing a prison sentence for asking his

wife to take speeding points.



Clegg also faced a week-long media barrage in the run-up to polling day over his

handling of allegations of sexual impropriety by the party's former chief

executive, Lord Rennard.



The former party leader Paddy Ashdown praised Clegg's resilience, saying he had

withstood "the most ravenous media feeding frenzy I have ever experienced as a

Lib Dem in 40 years of politics".



Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, said the result showed the party could

retain its fortresses at the 2015 election, and was a victory for its local

organisation. An even more ebullient party president Tim Farron claimed: "This

is a staggering result and the people who had written us off will have egg all

over their faces. It will a turning point in this parliament and that we are in

a position to win this seat completely changes the narrative of the parliament".



Thornton praised the effective fighting spirit in his party.



The Conservative failure in Eastleigh raises searching questions over whether

Cameron has a credible strategy not just to topple the 15 Lib Dem-held seats

needed to secure an overall majority, but also to prevent Ukip as the new party

of protest gnawing into his wider vote in the next general election.



All the mainstream parties will now have to decide whether to respond to Ukip's

growing popularity by becoming more Eurosceptic and anti-immigrant, or instead

challenging the party as an empty vehicle of protest. Cameron had hoped he had

immunised himself from the Ukip threat by promising a referendum on EU

membership after the election, and ramping up the rhetoric on EU migration.



The Ukip candidate Diane James said: "The result was momentous. Three weeks ago

we said we wanted to create a four way marginal what we have done is create a

two-way marginal. To have come from absolutely nowhere to achieve that is a

fantastic result".



Nigel Farage, Ukip's leader, promised to put 2,000 candidates into the field in

the May county council elections, insisting that "this was not a freak result,

but shows that something is moving".



He predicted border controls and immigration will become central to the future

EU debate in the UK, and claimed a "political earthquake" was coming.



The Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said it was rare for a governing party to

capture a seat, but insisted that "come a general election voters will make a

choice between whether they wanted David Cameron or Ed Miliband walking up

Downing Street".



Labour came a disappointing fourth, but denied the result casts a shadow over Ed

Miliband's claims that his vision of One Nation Labour has enough content to

appeal in southern England. In 2010, Labour won nearly 10% of the vote in

Eastleigh, but instead of Labour becoming the vehicle for a protest against the

government, Ukip - which had 3.6% share in 2010 - has surged past Labour.



Labour admitted immigration had been the main national issue on the doorstep,

and Miliband is to dedicate a TV political broadcast to the issue next

Wednesday,



Labour insisted it could still win its target seats in the south but added that

in Eastleigh it simply did not have the local base in a short campaign to match

the Lib Dems' ground operation.



The Lib Dems poured thousands of activists into the seat, they have a

stranglehold on the council and Clegg visited the constituency five times.



But as recently as the 1994 byelection, when there was a Conservative government

and Labour were the main opposition, Labour secured 27.6%.



In 2005, when Labour last won a general election, they scored 20.6% in

Eastleigh.

National: Cameron faces isolation over EU shakeup: Van Rompuy says no other

leader likely to back plan: UK faces new battle over cap on bankers' bonuses



BYLINE: Ian Traynor and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 890 words





David Cameron was put on notice last night that no other EU leader is likely to

support his campaign to rewrite the terms of British membership of the union and

then put the outcome to a referendum.



As Britain faces a fresh EU battle over a proposal to cap bankers' bonuses,

Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European council, attacked the way the

prime minister was waging his campaign for a "new settlement" in Britain's

40-year membership of the EU.



The president said he presumed leaders of other EU countries "neither

particularly like . . . nor particularly fear" Cameron's plans to demand the

repatriation of powers during a future revision of the Lisbon treaty.



"How do you convince a room full of people, when you keep your hand on the door

handle? How to encourage a friend to change, if your eyes are searching for your

coat?" he asked at a Policy Network conference in London.



The intervention by Van Rompuy, who chairs and organises the regular EU summits,

came as Cameron served notice that Britain would challenge an EU agreement to

slash bankers' bonuses at a meeting of European finance ministers next week.



Amid fears that the EU agreement could deal a hammer blow to the City of London,

Cameron said EU regulations needed to be flexible enough to allow international

banks to operate in Britain and the rest of the EU.



At a meeting of Nordic leaders in the Latvian capital, Riga, he said: "We need

to make sure that regulation put in place in Brussels is flexible enough to

allow (international) banks (in London) to continue competing and succeeding

while being located in the UK."



Britain will need to win allies to amend, or reject, the plans hammered out in

Brussels on Wednesday night between officials from the EU's 27 members, MEPs and

the European commission. They are decided by qualified majority voting, which

means no member state has a national veto.



But there were signs that the UK is in danger of alienating one of its closest

allies when the Netherlands questioned Cameron's plan to use a future treaty

change, which may be held to underpin the euro, as a way of repatriating powers.



Frans Timmermans, the Dutch foreign minister, told the Policy Network: "We will

do everything to avoid treaty change if we can fix (the eurozone) within

existing treaties. I believe this is the common opinion in almost all member

states. This is going to be an interesting case for the British government. If

they still want a referendum one would ask: a referendum on what if you don't

have a treaty change?"



In the first setpiece response from a European leader to Cameron's speech, Van

Rompuy endorsed the Dutch view that there is scant appetite for renegotiating

the Lisbon treaty. "Changing the EU treaties is not the priority," he said. "The

work ahead is crucial, but I see no impending need to open the EU treaties for

it. Nor do I feel much appetite for it around the leaders' table."



The president warned that UK government policy on Europe was not just a matter

to be sorted out between London and Brussels. It had to be agreed with 26 other

governments which were already adjusting their policies and decision-taking

because of the Cameron campaign.



In remarks not voiced in public since Cameron made his much-delayed referendum

speech last month, and delivered in London to boot, the former Belgian prime

minister said: "The wish to redefine your country's relationship with the union

has not gone unnoticed. I cannot speak on behalf of the other presidents and

prime ministers, but I presume they neither particularly like it, nor

particularly fear it."



Arguing that Britain had much to gain by remaining a central player in the EU,

and that pooling sovereignty with Germany, France and the other 25 member states

actually magnified UK clout, Van Rompuy called on Cameron to play a more

assertive and positive role in pressing its liberal, free-trade agenda.



Olli Rehn, the influential commissioner for monetary affairs, echoed Van

Rompuy's call for Britain to play a more central role, warning that it "should

not seek to undo our community. This is a game in which, if I were a British

citizen, I would want my country to be playing as a midfield playmaker rather

than watching from the sidelines. No one ever scored goals sitting on the

bench."



Van Rompuy conceded that Cameron would be able to discuss the changes he was

seeking at an EU summit, while appearing to rule out any fundamental revision of

British membership terms.



Senior officials and EU ambassadors in Brussels confirmed this was the

prevailing view among the other governments.



Appearing to deliver a message to Cameron and Britain that had been co-ordinated

with other EU capitals, Van Rompuy said: "The thing is, stepping out of existing

areas of co-operation is not just a matter between 'London' and 'Brussels'. It

would impact on the relationship between your country and 26, soon 27 others. It

is with each of them - friends, neighbours and partners - that you'll have to

make your case."



Van Rompuy warned that Britain was free to exit the EU, but that the exit

"doesn't come for free. It would be legally and politically a most complicated

and unpractical affair. Just think of a divorce after 40 years of marriage."

Front: Cameron warned over failure at byelection: Warning for PM over Eastleigh

byelection



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour and Steven Morris



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 695 words





David Cameron's leadership will be in crisis if the Conservatives come third in

the Eastleigh byelection today behind the Liberal Democrats and Ukip, the

rightwing Tory David Davis warned yesterday.



His remarks, before the critical by-election for the coalition partners, reflect

Conservative concern that the main route to an overall majority at the next

election will be blocked if Tories cannot capture a string of Liberal Democrat

seats.



Eleven of the Tories' top 43 target seats are held by the Lib Dems, and senior

Conservatives are preparing for a bitter inquest if they fail to capture

Eastleigh.



Davis said: "I think if we came third it would be a crisis, I think that's the

case, and if it's a close second with Ukip on our tail it will also be

uncomfortable."



He insisted neither result would dislodge Cameron. "He's going to be there till

the next election, but the simple truth is that it will make things more

uncomfortable in the House of Commons."



Nick Clegg, campaigning in Eastleigh, insisted the Lib Dems were on the "cusp of

a great, great victory" for their candidate, local councillor Mike Thornton.



Speaking to party loyalists at the Lib Dems' headquarters on a trading estate

yesterday evening, Clegg said it was one of the most closely contested

byelections that he could remember but he believed that his party could squeeze

home.



Conservative chances were boosted by the backdrop of the resignation of the

former MP Chris Huhne and the media controversy over Clegg's handling of

allegations of sexual misdemeanours by Lord Rennard, the party's former chief

executive. Yesterday Clegg was forced to admit that Rennard's resignation in

2009 was not purely on health grounds, but against a backdrop of allegations

about sexual harassment.



The seat is the Tories' 55th most marginal target seat, requiring a 3.3% swing.

But senior Tory sources acknowledged it was highly unlikely they would win in

Eastleigh, saying the Rennard issue had not resonated with the public.



Confidence was expressed that the Tories' candidate, Maria Hutchings, who has

fought a troubled campaign, could see off a last-minute push by Ukip.



But with some betting sites putting Ukip at evens to win, Nigel Farage, the

party's leader, said he would be disappointed if the Ukip candidate only came

third.



Campaigning in the constituency for a seventh time, Farage hardened the party's

line on immigration by suggesting that an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians

next year could lead to a surge in crime.



Pointing to Office for National Statistics figures published this week showing

the number of Romanians arrested over the past five years in London, Farage

said: "I think this highlights even more strongly than in the terms we set out

to begin with why people should use this byelection as an opportunity to send a

shattering message to the coalition that we do not want total open-door

immigration to Romania and Bulgaria."



On his party's chances, he said: "We're excited. If Cameron loses it's a

disaster, if Clegg loses it's a catastrophe. Us losing doesn't do us a lot of

harm, us winning will break the dam."



The Ukip candidate, Diane James, said she believed she could send shockwaves

through the political establishment.



Davis, who contested the Tory leadership with Cameron in 2005, suggested the

Tory right would pump up the pressure for a different economic strategy in the

budget next month.



He said the cuts programme needed to be fiercer. "We've had a lot of rhetoric

about austerity; we need a bit more reality about it. We need more cuts I'm

afraid, or at least those same cuts faster."



He added the route to growth lay through lower taxes.



Labour is preparing for its candidate, the writer John O'Farrell, to come fourth

in what may be seen as a rebuff for Ed Miliband's one nation message.



Shadow cabinet members who have been in Eastleigh say immigration was an issue

on the doorstep. Miliband has already made two speeches on immigration since he

became leader and a third is in the pipeline. Cameron has attempted to stave off

a Ukip surge both by promising a referendum on the EU after the general

election, and by hinting at restricting EU migrants' access to benefits.

Comment: Italy's voters may yet shake the whole European system: Beppe Grillo

showed how to ride the wave of wildcat populism sweeping the continent.

Eastleigh could be next to feel its force



BYLINE: Simon Jenkins



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 28



LENGTH: 917 words





Oh happy day. The Italian election result is a triumph for democracy. "No pope,

no government, no police chief," went yesterday's viral tweet, hailing the

arrival in Rome of "punk politics". The outcome is an antidote, not just to

Italy's corrupt politics, but to the dogma of austerity that now has Europe's

economy by the throat. The only way of loosening its grip is through the ballot.

Congratulations, Italy.



The most spectacular victor is Beppe Grillo, a rollicking satirist but with a

clear message: that austerity, the euro and corruption are jointly to blame for

Italy's ills. We can argue the issues, but why bother when no one listens? Just

tell those in charge, as he says, to fuck off. When politicians banned Grillo

from TV, he turned to the blog and the piazza. His knockout blow was the ballot.



Grillo's chief victim is the short-lived prime minister, Mario Monti. He was

pushed into office by the banks a year ago to impose unlimited suffering on the

Italian economy, so as to shore up the euro and thus protect German and other

bank loans from devaluation. Darling of the bankers' ramp, he was Super-Mario.



Like Greece and with no local currency to take the strain, the Italian economy

had to be waterboarded. It shrank by at least 2.2% last year, with official

unemployment at about 10%. Monti promised to hold the Italian economy in its

downward spiral, without growth and ever less able to repay its mounting debt.

Future generations would be in perpetual bondage to German banks.



Grillo spoke for those generations. His one roughly coherent policy may be a

referendum on the euro, but leaving the euro is the key that unlocks the prison

door. Even the revival of the outrageous Silvio Berlusconi is good news: his

irresponsibility might contribute to pushing Italy into financial crisis and

eventual salvation.



For what seems an entire decade, Europe is to be dominated by the "politics of

austerity", a gamble with the economy of an entire continent on a par with that

of the 1920s. Leaders (and their bankers) claim that austerity is a "necessary"

punishment, to be visited on European people for allowing their governments to

borrow beyond their means. The policy offers no growth to pay off the debts, and

for the eurozone no devaluation to reduce their incidence. The message is forget

Keynes and take the medicine, even if it is poison.



Despite being outside the euro straitjacket, Britain's George Osborne holds that

austerity knows no bounds. As he starves the economy of demand and it duly

shrinks, his revenue slides - and the debt and deficit rise. There is a classic

vicious circle. Sooner or later, austerity becomes an end, not a means: an

obsessive self-flagellation. These finance ministers are like Aztec priests at

an altar. If the blood sacrifice fails to deliver rain, there must be more

blood.



You can fool a democracy only so long. The current anti-Keynesian dogma has

lasted four years and is just not working. In Greece and Spain, unemployment is

touching an appalling quarter of the workforce. France is in trouble and, even

in Germany, the strain is telling as growth falls.



Europe's leaders are steadily dragging their joint economies towards depression,

afflicting their competitive relation with the outside world possibly for ever.

Nor can they blame others. They are doing it to themselves, voluntarily, in

obeisance to the gods of confidence, who long ago abandoned them.



Clearly no new idea will dent these dogmatists. Economists are to modern

government what doctors were to tobacco companies, as good as the last fee.

Change will only come, as Chesterton said, with "a sharp blow to the head" and

from a blunt instrument.



That instrument is the ballot. If there is one thing a politician dreads more

than a central banker, it is an election. Greece briefly fell last year under

the spell of the anti-austerity star, Alexis Tsipras. Holland is fiercely

anti-austerity. France saw the anti-austerity left bundle Nicolas Sarkozy out of

office. Spanish austerity is at the mercy of maverick separatists. Italy has

Grillo, with heaven knows what result.



Tomorrow at the Eastleigh byelection, the party of Britain's own Grillo is

predicted to shock the coalition government. Ukip's Nigel Farage may come from

right of stage, but his appeal is similar to Grillo's. Conventional politics has

gone bureaucratically native. The European tier of government is aloof and the

eurozone rigid. One-solution Europe does not fit all. The wildcats have the same

cry: follow me to the forum and throw the bastards out.



Italy has long been Britain's favourite foreign country. Even as its two great

institutions, the republic and the catholic church, stumble into corruption and

immorality, all must be well. This is Italy where even the ungovernable is bella

figura. No one believes this will cease.



Yet wildcat populism always terrifies the existing order. In America it is the

Tea Party and Occupy. In Scandinavia, Holland, Austria and France, a communist,

poujardist or fascist periodically crashes the system. Mosley did it in pre-war

Britain. Since then Powellism, nationalism, Respect, even the odd Liberal has

threatened, for a while, to upset the bipartisan apple cart.



It seldom lasts. Italian politics will establish a new equilibrium. If lucky it

will be outside the euro and on the way to recovery; if not it will be in

lifetime bondage to eurozone bankers. Either way Italy will remember the heady

moment of February 2013, and so should we.

Front: EU in turmoil as Italy halts austerity plan: Germany urges Rome to

continue cuts programme as poll fallout hits markets



BYLINE: Ian Traynor in Brussels, John Hooper in Rome and Phillip Inman



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 997 words





Three years of German-led austerity and budget cuts aimed at saving the euro and

retooling the European economy was last night facing one of its biggest

challenges as Italian voters' rejection of spending cuts and tax rises opened up

a stark new fissure in European politics.



The governing stalemate in Rome and the vote in the general election - by three

to two - against the austerity policies pursued by Italy's humiliated caretaker

prime minister, Mario Monti, meant that the spending cuts and tax rises dictated

by the eurozone would grind to a halt, risking a re-eruption of the euro crisis

after six months of relative stability.



Fears that the deadlock will lengthen Italy's near two-year recession and spill

over into the rest of the eurozone hit markets across Europe. The Italian

banking sector fell 7% in value, dragging the main MIB stock market index 4%

lower.



The market turmoil in Milan spread to Germany, France and the UK, with domestic

banks among the biggest fallers. Deutsche Bank saw almost 5% knocked off its

value, while Barclays suffered a 4% decline. The FTSE 100 fell 1.4%. The German

Dax slumped more than 2% and the Paris Cac was down 2.75%.



The cliffhanger vote saw the maverick comedian Beppe Grillo's 5 Star movement

take almost one in four of the votes and the political revival of the ex-prime

minister Silvio Berlusconi. But the narrow victor, Pier Luigi Bersani, on the

centre-left, claimed the mantle of the premiership, although it was unclear if

he would be able to form a government.



Despite the withering popular verdict on cuts and taxes, Brussels and Berlin

insisted the austerity programme had to be continued in Italy. France and others

seized on the outcome for their own purposes, arguing for a relaxation of

spending cuts and greater emphasis on policies to boost growth and job creation.



Bersani moved to try to cobble a government together by wooing the upstart

Grillo with tentative talk of a reformist leftist coalition. Looking weary,

Bersani said it was time for the 5 Star movement to do more than just demand a

clean sweep of Italy's established political order.



"Up to now they have been saying 'All go home'. But now they are here too. So

either they go home as well, or they say what they want to do for their country

and their children."



Grillo said earlier his followers in parliament would not join a coalition, but

would consider proposals "law by law, reform by reform".



Bersani said that, since his four-party alliance had won an outright majority in

the lower house of the Italian parliament and more seats than any other grouping

in the Senate, it had a responsibility to suggest ways in which Italy could be

governed, despite the deadlock in the upper house.



Shunning the idea of a grand coalition with Berlusconi and the right, he

proposed a government committed to a five-point plan for sweeping reform of

Italy's political parties and institutions.



The north-south split in Europe opened up by the election presaged clashes

between eurozone governments, likely to surface at an EU summit next month, amid

calls for a shift away from the harsh regime prescribed and driven through by

Berlin in recent years as the price of bailing out insolvent eurozone periphery

countries.



The Italian stalemate combines with tough negotiations over a bailout for Cyprus

- being resisted by Germany - worries about the French economy, an unresolved

debt crisis in Spain, and David Cameron's decision to throw Britain's future in

Europe into question, making EU politics unusually volatile.



"Italy plays a central role in successfully overcoming Europe's debt crisis,"

said the German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle.



"So we assume that the policy of fiscal consolidation and reform will be

consistently followed by a new government."



Angela Merkel, bidding for a third term as German chancellor in September, has

been banking on a period of eurozone calm in the runup to her election, but

Italian voters have wrecked that calculation.



The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, recently made head of the

political committee that runs the euro, said Monti's policies had to be

continued: "They are crucial for the entire eurozone."



The European Commission echoed the calls for sticking with the austerity

medicine. Italy has the highest national debt level in the eurozone after

Greece, although its budget deficit is in better shape than many others,

including France and the Netherlands.



But Paris led the chorus for a policy shift. French government ministers,

including Pierre Moscovici, the finance minister, demanded a change of course in

remarks directed at Berlin.



Spain waited anxiously to see what impact the Italian leap in the dark would

have on its debt crisis. "This is a jump to nowhere that does not bode well

either for Italy or for Europe," said the foreign minister, Jose Manuel

Garcia-Margallo, adding he was "extremely concerned" about the effect on Spain's

borrowing costs.



Both Berlusconi and Grillo have been harshly critical of the Germans, decried

Monti's austerity packages, and have raised questions as to whether Italy, the

eurozone's third biggest economy, should remain in the single currency. Grillo

has called for a referendum on the matter.



Berlusconi rounded on the Germans yesterday, declaring that the "spread" - the

difference between how much Italy and Germany pay to borrow on the bond markets

- had been "invented" two years ago. This was code for saying that Berlin and

Frankfurt, the German government and the European Central Bank, conspired to

push up the cost of Italian borrowing in 2011 in order to topple Berlusconi and

bring in Monti, the technocratic darling of the eurozone elite.



The turmoil saw Italian bond yields also jump, indicating that any new

government will be forced to pay a higher interest rate on its debts.



The 10-year Italian bond yield edged back into dangerous territory yesterday

after it passed 4.9%, although this is a far cry from 2011 when the yields shot

up above 7%.

Italian election: You are in the establishment now - Bersani reaches out to

Grillo: Five Star founder finds himself cast as kingmaker Left leader tries to

lure rising party into coalition



BYLINE: John Hooper in Rome



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 16



LENGTH: 665 words





The leader of Italy's centre left, Pier Luigi Bersani, set out yesterday to lure

Beppe Grillo and his Five Star Movement (M5S) into a coalition government after

their spectacular breakthrough in the general election.



At a press conference in Rome, a weary-looking Bersani said it was time for the

upstart movement to do something more than just demand the removal of Italy's

mainstream politicians.



"Up to now, they have been saying: 'All go home.' But now they're here, too. So

either they go home as well, or they say what they want to do for their country

and their children."



Grillo had earlier said his followers in parliament would not join a coalition,

but would consider proposals "law by law, reform by reform".



Bersani said that since his four-party alliance had won an outright majority in

the lower house of the Italian parliament, and more seats than any other

grouping in the senate, it had a responsibility to suggest ways in which Italy

could be governed, despite the deadlock in the upper house caused by the M5S's

stunning gains.



Pouring cold water on the idea floated by Silvio Berlusconi of a grand coalition

with the right, he proposed a government committed to a radical overhaul of

Italy's politics and institutions, outlining a five-point plan for sweeping

reform.



In a clear attempt to lure M5S into the mainstream, he hinted that Grillo's

movement, as the party with most votes, should get the speakership of the lower

house.



Talking to reporters outside his home in Genoa, Grillo, who has always denied

being the leader of the M5S, announced he would be representing his movement in

the negotiations with President Giorgio Napolitano aimed at forming a new

government. But he made clear that the movement he co-founded just over three

years ago remained as anti-establishment as ever.



He said he would like to see the iconoclastic Nobel prize-winning playwright and

actor Dario Fo succeed Napolitano as head of state. And he declared that Italy

was in the midst of a "generational war".



Grillo also predicted that Italy's next government would last no more than six

months. "They won't be able to govern," he said. "Whether I'm there or not, they

won't be able govern."



Bersani made it clear that he considered his alliance to have been defeated in

the election. "We have not won, even if we finished first," he said. He also

acknowledged that the elections signified "a rejection of politics as it has

been presented in recent years: (a rejection of) inefficient institutions and of

politics that have appeared as morally non-credible."



The five points on which he was inviting a consensus were: reform of

institutions; reform of political parties; legislation on public and private

morality, an apparent reference to measures to tackle corruption; the defence of

those most exposed to the effects of the recession; and a commitment to a new

European employment policy.



But, in a reference to the thorniest issue that is likely to lie between him and

Grillo, Bersani made it clear he would not compromise on his party's policy

towards the EU or the euro. Grillo has called for a referendum on membership of

the single currency. But, said Bersani, "Italy out of the euro would run into

disaster."



Though at one point he left the door open a crack to Berlusconi's Freedom People

movement, he later said that he and the leader of the right would "confront each

other in parliament".



Bersani was not the only one to be courting Grillo, the new kingmaker of Italian

politics. His overtures to M5S came as his leading partner in the centre left,

Nichi Vendola, dropped a hint he might be considering a separate deal with

Grillo's movement. Vendola, the governor of Puglia, where the centre left took

one of its worst hidings in the election, is also the leader of the radical

Left, Ecology and Freedom party. In a message sent through Twitter, he flattered

the founder of the M5S, saying: "Grillo is the true winner of the elections."

And he added: "Phoney alliances will not be enough."

Front: Italy election result sparks fresh fears for euro



BYLINE: John Hooper and Lizzy Davies in Rome



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 1051 words





Italy threatened to pitch the eurozone into fresh turmoil last night as the

result of its general election pointed to a hung parliament and confirmed the

anti-establishment Five Star Movement, led by a comedian-turned-politician, had

exploded on to the national stage.



With almost all the votes counted, the centre-left had a lead in the race for

the lower house, the chamber of deputies, where it would be assured an outright

majority under electoral rules. It was also reckoned to have more seats in the

senate, beating a resurgent right led by Silvio Berlusconi by a narrow margin.

However, the figures and estimates given did not include the results of four

overseas constituencies.



Neither right nor left had an outright majority in the upper house, where the

balance will be held by Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement (M5S). Grillo has

ruled out supporting either side in his drive to sweep away Italy's existing

political parties and the cronyistic culture they support - a sentiment he

appeared to reiterate last night by insisting the M5S was not planning on "any

stitch-ups, big or small" and lambasting Berlusconi's voters for committing "a

crime against the galaxy".



In an audio message broadcast live online, Grillo said that, after his

movement's "exceptional" results, the mainstream parties were "finished, and

they know it". "We've started a war of generations . . . They've been there for

25 to 30 years and they've led this country to catastrophe," he said. "We will

be an extraordinary force . . . We will be 110 inside (the parliament) and

several million outside."



Exceeding even the most adventurous pre-electoral predictions, the M5S emerged

as Italy's biggest single party in the chamber - a result that will send

shockwaves through the eurozone and beyond. Grillo boasted it had achieved its

prominence in the space of little more than three years, "with no money and no

(state) funding." However, Grillo's movement lagged the two big alliances in the

number of seats because it is running alone and not in a coalition.



The result indicated that fresh elections were a strong possibility and, at

best, foreshadowed a weak government unable to pass the tough reforms Italy

needs to enhance its grim economic prospects.



Pier Luigi Bersani, the leader of the centre-left Democratic Party, appeared to

signal that his party would attempt to form a government. "It is clear to

everyone that a highly delicate situation is developing for the country," he was

quoted by the Ansa news agency as saying. "We will manage the responsibility

these elections have given us in the interest of Italy."



Gianfranco Fini, a former foreign minister whose party ran as part of outgoing

prime minister Mario Monti's centrist alliance, said: "I think the worst is yet

to come for Italy."



European leaders have been desperate to see a stable government in Italy, and

are likely to be horrified at the triumph of populism in the eurozone's third

biggest economy.



The likely results threaten to reignite the euro's instability after months of

relative calm. The markets took fright: the "spread" between Italian and German

government bonds, which increases in line with investors' concern over Italy's

ability to repay its debts, shot up and the Milan bourse had a rollercoaster

session, closing 0.73% up - before the full degree of uncertainty was apparent.

Meanwhile the Dow Jones fell 216.4 points, or 1.55%, to end at 13,784.17.



Grillo, and to a lesser extent Berlusconi - both showmen politicians - were the

victors. The understated Bersani saw an initially substantial lead in the polls

slip away. Angelino Alfano, named by Berlusconi as the right's prime minister in

case of victory, said the result was "very positive - I would say extraordinary,

even - and we are very satisfied".



But the biggest loser of all was the sober, professorial Monti. His ill-assorted

alliance of free-market liberals, Christian Democrats and former neofascists

appeared to have garnered barely 10% of the vote. Its failure was the price of

the tax increases and unpopular reforms that Monti's administration imposed

after taking office in November 2011.



Monti insisted he was content with the result, having created a programme that

had presented voters with a "realistic" way forward for the country. "Ours is a

satisfying result," he told a press conference.



But his dismal showing could have a decisive impact on the prospects for a

stable government because his bloc seems to be unable to furnish either of the

two main alliances with the seats needed for a senate majority.



A representative of the M5S avoided ruling out a deal to elect the country's

next prime minister. Alessandro Di Battista told the news agency Ansa: "We are

waiting for the official figures. First, we need to know how many we are - count

ourselves up. Then we'll meet, listen to the web and decide what to do."



The projections suggested the movement could have more than 50 seats in the

315-seat senate and well over 100 in the 630-seat lower house. While paying

tribute to Grillo's contribution to the M5S's result, Di Battista stressed the

movement's elected representatives would take their decisions independently of

him.



Grillo embarked on a barnstorming tour of the country that took him to 77 towns

from the Alps to the tip of the "boot" and on to Sicily. He rounded it off with

a rally in Rome that attracted several hundred thousand people.



Turnout was about 75% - the lowest since the Italian republic was founded after

the second world war. Abstention was encouraged by heavy snow in parts of the

north and centre of the country and storms and flooding in the south. But it was

rooted in widespread disillusionment over the corruption and stagnation in

Italian politics.



Former Berlusconi supporters who had been toying with abstention seem to have

been persuaded to vote in force by the media tycoon's promise to abolish an

unpopular property tax on primary residences and refund the euros 4bn (£3.4bn)

levied in 2012.



The tax was imposed as part of a drive by Monti's technocratic government to put

Italy's public finances in order after a collapse at the end of 2011 in investor

confidence.



Now that risk is fast taking shape again. Berlusconi is deeply mistrusted in the

markets and Grillo wants a referendum on whether Italy should quit the euro.

National: Make English the language of EU - German president



BYLINE: Kate Connolly, Berlin



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 502 words





Germany's president called yesterday for English to be made the language of the

European Union as he appealed to the UK to stay in the EU.



Joachim Gauck earned applause for his remarks, made in Berlin in a speech on

Europe's future at a time of rising German scepticism towards Brussels.



"Dear English, Scots, Welsh, Northern Irish and new British citizens, we want to

continue having you on board," he said. "We need your experience as the oldest

parliamentary democracy, we need your traditions, your sober-mindedness and your

courage."



He said that to encourage a greater sense of commonality, Europe needed a common

language as well as encouraging multilingualism. "I am convinced that, in

Europe, both can live side by side," he said. "The sense of being at home in

your mother tongue, with all its poetry, as well as a workable English for all

of life's situations and all age groups."



Appealing to Britons' sense of historical responsibility he emphasised the

formative role the UK had played in founding modern Europe by its fight against

Nazi Germany; if only for that reason, he said, the UK had an important role to

play.



"You helped to save our Europe with your engagement in the second world war - it

is also your Europe, and more Europe cannot mean a Europe without you. Only with

you can we tackle the future."



The remarks, which took up two minutes of his hour-long speech, followed David

Cameron's pledge to call a referendum on Britain's EU relationship, a prospect

that has caused much consternation in Berlin. Later on in the speech, which was

made at his Berlin residence, Schloss Bellevue, Gauck cracked a subtle joke

about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU, when he referred to the union's

"27 states" before smirking and correcting himself, saying to laughter from the

audience: "No, 28 of course."



Gauck used the nationally televised address to call for "more Europe" and

greater communication between members, but also sought to allay fears that

Germany was becoming too powerful and aspired to impose a "diktat".



"In Germany, more Europe does not mean a German Europe. For us, more Europe

means a European Germany," he said, adding that Germans had a very specific

relationship with and sense of obligation towards Europe precisely because of

their past. "After all, it was from our country that the attempts to destroy

everything European, all universal values, were unleashed," he said.



He pointed out that today's young Europeans "experience more Europe than

everyone else before you", and that they had become so used to travelling across

the continent without needing to show passports or change money, that they now

took those advantages for granted.



But, he said, at a time of crisis, the time had come for Europeans to have a

more active relationship with the union. "Don't ask what Europe can do for you,

but ask what you can do for Europe," he said.

International: Opponent calls Turkish PM an elected dictator



BYLINE: Simon Tisdall



SECTION: GUARDIAN INTERNATIONAL PAGES; Pg. 43



LENGTH: 304 words





Turkey's prime minister is behaving like an elected dictator and inciting a

constitutional crisis in a bid for greater personal power, the leader of the

country's main opposition party has warned.



Kemal Kilicdaroglu, chairman of the social democratic Republican People's party

(CHP), said Recep Tayyip Erdogan, premier since 2003, was determined to change

the constitution to create an executive presidency, to which post he would

switch after elections due next year.



"Turkey needs a new constitution to protect individual rights," Kilicdaroglu

said. The 1982 charter was out of date and at odds with Turkey's EU ambitions,

he said, but Erdogan's plans ignored the need for a separation of powers, for

instance by allowing the president to appoint judges.



"The prime minister is more and more authoritarian, unfortunately," Kilicdaroglu

said. "The sovereignty of fear is ubiquitous. No one can talk with ease on the

telephone . . . the media are fearful.



"There is not one single dissenting voice within his own party. The attempt to

create an executive presidency is all about the concentration of power in a

single hand. It will be a disaster for Turkey."



The constitutional row is expected to come to a head next month, after Erdogan's

ruling party indicated it would impose a guillotine on debate in the

constitutional commission by the end of March.



If agreement is lacking, the government needs the backing of at least four

opposition MPs to push through the new charter and send it for ratification in a

referendum, which it is confident it would win.



Kilicdaroglu was interviewed during a meeting at the House of Commons sponsored

by Keith Vaz MP and chaired by Jo Glanville of English PEN, which promotes and

defends freedom of expression.

Leading Article: Ed Miliband and the week in politics: Something blue and

something new



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 44



LENGTH: 682 words





Two speeches yesterday, one by a man who has been this country's prime minister,

the other by a man who wants to be our next one, mark what may be a watershed

moment in the party politics of this parliament. Sir John Major's speech at

Chatham House supporting David Cameron's EU referendum proposal was a decent

speech by a decent man. But it could not escape being a reminder of what was,

and still is, wrong with the Conservative party. Significant though the issue

unquestionably is, Europe is neither the most important question facing Britain

today nor the one that tops most people's list of concerns. But it is the number

one obsession of large parts of the Tory party, and that obsession warps

everything else. Sir John is right that a vote to stay in the EU would be good

for Britain, but he of all people ought to know that a Tory party consumed by

the European issue is not good for this country - and will deserve to be

punished for it.



Ever since Mr Cameron focused his attention on this predominantly internal party

issue last month, the Tory party's poll ratings have suffered. The Guardian's

ICM poll this week, showing the Tories down at 29% and a strong Labour lead of

12 points, was striking evidence of the penalty the Conservative party is

paying. ICM's findings have subsequently been confirmed by other polls this week

where the figures are in similar territory. The Tories' wilful misreading of the

public mood is inescapably an opportunity for Labour to cement its appeal. But

it is also a challenge to the opposition too. To win an election and govern

effectively, Labour will have to win the voters' confidence, not simply offer

itself as the vessel through which voters express their irritation with Tory

failings. The purpose of Ed Miliband's speech in Bedford yesterday was to begin

the task of winning that confidence.



Mr Miliband's overarching aims were to establish the declining living standards

of ordinary people as the central battleground of the 2015 election and to

address Labour's trailing poll ratings on economic management. His narrative of

modern Britain, as he explained to our political editor this week, is that the

disproportionately growing wealth of those at the top is not just squeezing the

living standards of those on the middle and bottom rungs of the ladder, but is

also smothering the chances of growth. The message yesterday was that rewards

and incentives for the many can be both the engine of new growth and also a more

generous form of wealth distribution. It is a powerful message, giving a bit of

substance to the rather nebulous One Nation slogan, and potentially well suited

to hard economic times. And while Mr Miliband's specific pledges of a (welcome)

mansion tax on property worth over £2m and the (questionable) restoration of a

10p in the pound tax bracket do not seal the deal, they are clear markers of the

direction that a Labour government could take. Promises of cheaper train tickets

and energy bills are easier to make than deliver, but this is plainly fertile

terrain.



There was tactical cunning in Mr Miliband's speech as well as a big picture.

Embracing the 10p tax pledge - which has its supporters on the Tory benches -

cramps George Osborne's style in his budget planning. Taking up the mansion tax

gives Labour something substantive to talk about to the Liberal Democrats if a

differently configured hung parliament emerges in 2015. Openly criticising

Gordon Brown goes some way towards answering taunts that Labour's Eds are part

of the problem not the solution. It would be naive to pretend that this speech

is a game-changer.



Labour has an economic credibility deficit that will not be overcome by a single

speech. Mr Miliband has not won the argument yet and still seems reluctant to

talk about Britain's economic problems in the wider global context with which Mr

Cameron, for all the false conclusions he draws, seems more comfortable. But Mr

Miliband has begun to write something specific on what for too long has been

Labour's fiscal blank page. For that alone, he deserves credit for a good day's

work.

Analysis: Tory blunders do Miliband's work



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 597 words





There is an old adage that any poll that makes a good headline is probably

wrong, and it is possible that the Guardian/ICM poll giving Labour its largest

lead since 2003 is an outlier. But ICM is probably the most respected polling

organisation in the country and does not have a notable history of producing

wild results from out of the blue.



This poll shows a sharp reversal in the coalition's fortunes. In the previous

poll, last month, Labour's lead narrowed from eight points, a margin it had

enjoyed for three consecutive months, to five. Now that lead has widened to the

largest since the fall of Saddam Hussein, when voters praised Tony Blair for his

decisive action in ridding the Middle East of a brutal dictator.



It is hard to pinpoint a set of events in the past month that justifies a surge

in Labour support. Ed Miliband has had a relatively low profile in the new year,

while David Cameron has played his populist card on an EU referendum.



Those in Downing Street who thought the prime minister's move would not only

quieten the backbenches but lead to a poll boost have been frustrated. Dissent

on the Tory benches over Cameron's leadership and the issue of gay marriage has

continued unabated.



Almost all polls show that jobs and the economy are what move voters most. There

is some evidence that the Conservative lead on the economy is receding, and long

has been among female voters. February's Guardian/ICM poll shows 29% of voters

still blame Labour for the economic crisis and 23% the Conservatives.



It is possible that the economy's return to negative growth in the fourth

quarter of 2012 was a turning point. The chancellor, George Osborne, will have

to work ever harder to convince the electorate that the economy is healing, and

if it is not, that the responsibility lies with Ed Balls and Ed Miliband.



The poll also shows Cameron, despite a year of internal discussion in No 10 on

how to address this issue failing to improve his popularity with women voters.

Whereas among men Labour enjoys a seven-point lead over the Tories (36%-29%),

among women it is 26 points (51%-25%). The government's recent handling of

childcare announcements has obviously not instilled confidence.



So if the coalition continues to bang goals into its own net, Labour can reach

full-time in 2015 without its defensive lines being tested. At the moment it

survives week after week without any serious media scrutiny. But even strong

Labour supporters acknowledge that the party's lead is at best soft.



Anthony Painter, writing on the website Labour List and drawing on polling

prepared by the former Conservative deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, points out

that on three of the four most salient issues - welfare dependency, immigration

and cutting the deficit - Labour not only trails the Conservatives but

significantly so.



Painter concludes: "If Labour fails to narrow its deficit on welfare,

immigration and debt, and the economy turns for the better before 2015, then its

poll lead is likely to narrow very rapidly."



The Institute of Fiscal Studies said recently that the UK economy could grow

rapidly in late 2014 or early 2015, and certainly faster than the rest of the

EU. At that point Osborne will ram home the argument that voters should not give

the keys back to the driver who steered the car into the ditch. From here it

sounds a compelling argument.



By then Labour will have to convince voters that it has the values to lift the

economy. The issue is whether Labour has the intellectual resolve and internal

unity to come up with policies to turn that aspiration into reality.

Poll shows Labour leading Tories by biggest margin in a decade: ICM survey shows

party with 12-point lead Women turn backs on Conservatives



BYLINE: Tom Clark



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 701 words





Labour has forged a 12-point lead over the Conservatives for the first time in

almost a decade, according to a Guardian/ICM poll.



Ed Miliband's party stands at 41% of the vote, up three points on ICM's January

figure, and the Tories are on just 29%, having slipped back four from 33% last

month. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have sunk two points, to 13%, whereas

Ukip has inched up three to 9% - setting a new record for Nigel Farage's

anti-European outfit in the Guardian/ICM series.



Underlying the dire numbers for the Conservatives are signs of a gender divide

that will concern No 10. Among men Labour enjoys a seven-point lead over the

Tories (36%-29%), but among women the gap is 26 points (51%-25%).



Last month's coalition proposals to shake up childcare provision were aimed at

attracting the female vote. The crushing two-to-one split in the female vote

against the Tories is far too large to be explained by any quirk of this month's

ICM's sample. In January's poll - a better month for the Tories - whereas prime

minister's party was actually one point ahead of Labour among men (36%-35%),

among women it was already 16 points behind (29%-45%).



The Labour lead is the biggest - and the Conservative vote share the smallest -

in the polling series since May 2003, during the brief political bounce for Tony

Blair which came between the felling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad and

first stirrings of civil war in Iraq and arguments about dodgy dossiers.



With his party plumbing the sort of depths associated with the second half of

the John Major era, David Cameron will be dismayed with the continuing surge in

Ukip support, a challenge on the right flank which the prime minister's recent

speech proposing a referendum on the EU was designed to head off. In the runup

to this month's Eastleigh byelection yesterday's poll suggests that Conservative

hopes in the seat formerly held by Chris Huhne will have to rest more upon the

weakness of their coalition partners than anything else.



Labour's 12-point lead with ICM is larger than leads of nine and 10 points

recorded by two other polls reported by the Sunday Times and the Observer at the

weekend, and it is striking because ICM's methodology - which has delivered many

impressive predictions in past elections - adjusts the figures for "shy Tory

voters", the name given to the difference between the proportion who vote for

the party in elections and the proportion who say they will vote for the party

in opinion polls.



The detail of the new poll warns that Labour's new lead is not solid. The

sluggish economy will be the decisive battleground of the next election, and

after Britain's dive into a fresh economic contraction in the final quarter of

2012, the opposition might have expected to be winning the blame game. Instead,

more voters point the finger at the last Labour government than the coalition.



Asked to name the chief culprit for the economic slowdown, 29% identify Labour's

"debts . . . racked up to finance unsustainable spending". This is the same as

when the question was asked last May.



While Labour has failed to make any progress in this respect since May, the

coalition has slipped back. At that time only 17% of voters blamed government

cuts, compared with 23% now, whereas 24% identified "chill economic winds

blowing in from the eurozone", a proportion that has now shrunk to 16%, as the

crisis in the single currency has entered a less acute phase. The 21% of voters

who blame bankers for "refusing to provide loans" that firms need for investment

remains unchanged.



Among other assorted parties, the Scottish National party is at 2% (down one on

the month) while Plaid Cymru holds steady on 1%. The Greens' numbers also remain

unchanged, at 2%, while the British National party picks up a point, to stand at

2%.



ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1001 adults aged 18+ by telephone on

8-10 February 2013. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results

have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British

Polling Council and abides by its rules.

National: Cameron and Merkel finally drag EU into the age of austerity: Northern

Europeans win the day as EU budget is cut: But Britain's contribution still set

to increase



BYLINE: Ian Traynor and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 809 words





The age of austerity caught up with the European Union yesterday when a

gruelling 26-hour negotiation resulted in agreement to slash the new seven-year

EU budget by 3.3%, or euros 32bn, the first reduced budget in the union's

history.



The outcome was seen as a notable victory for David Cameron, who spearheaded a

north European campaign for budget cuts, and a defeat for his polar opposite in

the bargaining, Francois Hollande, whose pleas for a relaxation of austerity and

for more spending to spur growth were rejected.



"The British public can be proud that we have cut the seven-year credit card

limit for the EU for the first time ever," Cameron said. "The major problem we

have had is the credit card limit for the EU has been too high. It has always

been pushed up and at last someone's come along and said this has got to stop."



But Cameron acknowledged that, while the EU budget as a whole would be reduced,

Britain's own contributions to the EU would increase. He blamed this on changes

to the UK's EU rebate, introduced by Tony Blair in 2005, which ensure that the

12 new member states have a partial exemption from the compensatory payments to

Britain.



Cameron's satisfaction contrasted with Hollande's downbeat tone: "Europe has not

won as much as it could have."



In the short term, Hollande managed to protect French farmers by securing a

euros 1bn increase in the contested common agricultural policy compared with

figures proposed in November. The CAP took up by far the biggest chunk of the

new budget, 39%, but overall farm subsidies and spending are being cut by euros

50bn compared with the seven-year period ending this year as its share of the

total comes down progressively.



Following three years of financial crisis that threw the survival of the euro

into doubt and triggered swingeing cuts in public spending and services in many

EU member states, Cameron argued that the EU budget could not be immune from the

austerity. The summit agreed to cut the budget from more than euros 992bn in the

current period to euros 960bn, or 1% of EU gross domestic product, the figure

stipulated by the strongest politician in the EU, Angela Merkel.



This figure refers to spending pledges, while Cameron opted to focus on the

lower figure of euros 908.4bn, agreed as the supposed ceiling on what may be

spent.



France sought to get the second figure increased to euros 913bn, triggering an

overnight clash between London and Paris, with Germany cast in the role of

mediator and ultimately siding with Cameron.



After snubbing a bargaining session with Cameron and Merkel as the summit opened

on Thursday afternoon, Hollande later conceded. Unusually, senior French

officials paid tribute to the PM.



"He's a true negotiator with a lot of tenacity," said a French official. "At one

point (Hollande) said there needs to be a compromise . . . Cameron did not need

an agreement because the rebate is safe."



The crucial swing factor was Merkel, who broadly sided with Cameron, while

Hollande decided against leading a troika of France, Italy, and Spain.



Given Cameron's recent speech on Europe, committing the UK to an in-out

referendum by 2017, there was much rancour that his views should prevail when it

is not clear if Britain will be in the EU by 2020.



If Cameron won and Hollande lost, there were many who argued that Europe's

future prospects also lost out in a bout of horsetrading that prioritised

national and vested interests over smart investment.



National lobbies were bought off essentially by ransacking planned funding for

digitalisation, broadband investment, hi-tech, research, transport networks, and

infrastructure.



Some euros 50bn was raided from these areas in order to accommodate competing

national claims on the two biggest items in the budget - the CAP and the

cohesion funds that go mainly to eastern Europe and the less developed parts of

the union.



Unlike national budgets, the EU budget cannot be financed by borrowing and

deficit spending is outlawed. The euros 52bn gap between pledged spending and

the spending cap insisted on by Britain had critics predicting trouble ahead.



Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, said the budget figures

would break EU law and warned that the parliament would refuse to endorse them.

The budget needs to be passed by an absolute majority. The four biggest

parliamentary caucuses promptly denounced the deal. France sounded supportive of

a rejection.



The PM also demanded savings of up to euros 7bn in the salaries, pensions and

administration costs of the EU institutions. The issue is symbolic - the costs

are only 4% of the budget. The administrative budget was finally cut by only

euros 1bn.

National: Analysis Good result at the ideal time for PM: Nicholas Watt



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt in Brussels

Fuelled by copious cups of coffee, David Cameron chalked up a Brussels first at

the all-night EU summit. Looking mildly tired after 25 and a half hours on the

go, the prime minister hailed his achievement in negotiating the first ever cut

in an EU budget.



"The British public can be proud that we have cut the seven-year credit-card

limit for the EU for the first time ever," he said before travelling home.



Cameron will receive a warm, and possibly rapturous, reception from Tory MPs on

Monday when he reports back on securing his aim of a cut or real-terms freeze in

the EU's near-euros 1tn (£845bn) budget. While his red, puffy cheeks showed

signs of a gruelling experience, it is difficult to imagine a better outcome or

more fortunate timing for the prime minister.



Weeks after he was warned that he was marginalising Britain in the EU by

outlining plans for a referendum by 2017, Cameron has shown that Britain can

shape events. He believes the summit shows the wisdom of his three calculations

about the EU: that Britain should never underestimate its ability to be a major

player in the EU; it should not be frightened of laying down red lines not to be

crossed; and most importantly, that the key player in EU negotiations is the

German chancellor, Angela Merkel.



If she is pushed too far, Merkel will bite, as she did in 2011 when she drew up

the eurozone fiscal compact treaty outside the EU after Cameron wielded a veto.

But if she believes that Cameron's demands are reasonable, then she will work

constructively with him, as she did over the EU budget.



Cameron might, however, like to bear in mind the thinking of Merkel's officials

before the first budget summit in November. Berlin was prepared to see Cameron

isolated to show Merkel's displeasure as she awaited his speech on the EU, which

she feared would be hostile. In the end, Merkel worked closely with Cameron in

November for one simple reason: she agreed with his call for restraint.



The German chancellor is keen to co-operate with Cameron at a tactical level -

if she agrees with him - and at a broader strategic level to maintain the UK as

an influential member of the EU as a counterweight to the protectionist French.

But Merkel's support should never be taken for granted.



Cameron will need to calibrate his negotiating stances with care when he embarks

on the delicate task of repatriating EU powers, as he promised in his Bloomberg

speech on the EU.

National: Gay people, migrants and foxes put Eastleigh Tory on the spot: Tricky

first outing for byelection candidate: 'I would not have voted for same-sex

marriage'



BYLINE: Steven Morris



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 18



LENGTH: 699 words





The Conservative candidate in the Eastleigh byelection endured a tricky first

campaign outing when she faced awkward questions on comments attributed to her

about subjects including immigration, Europe, gay marriage and fox-hunting.



Maria Hutchings demonstrated that she is likely to receive plenty of coverage

during the campaign by saying that she would support Britain leaving the EU if

there was a referendum now and would have voted against gay marriage.



Hutchings also appeared to attempt to distance herself from the Tory leadership

by emphasising she was not a "rich toff" and vowed to fight housing developments

in the countryside, which could put her at odds with the coalition's planning

reforms. The Conservatives were the first party to unveil a candidate for the

byelection prompted by the fall of Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne. The Tory party

chairman, Grant Shapps, came to the Hampshire town to launch Hutchings's

campaign.



The first curveball was pitched within moments when Hutchings was asked how she

would have voted on gay marriage. "I would have not voted for same-sex

marriage," she replied. Candidate and chairman walked along Market Street and

visited Smedley's butcher shop before adjourning to the Poppins cafe, where she

did a round of interviews.



Hutchings, 51, explained how she had lived in this former railway town since

being selected to run against Huhne at the last election. She said she was a

hard-working mother-of-four who "lived and breathed the constituency". She was

determined to run a clean campaign and would not be drawn to comment on Huhne's

conviction. "That issue is in the past," she said.



Hutchings, who describes herself as a worker in the communications industry,

admitted she once had to borrow £1.80 to pay for parking from members of a job

club she ran in Eastleigh because a cash machine would not give her any money.



But the first really awkward moment came when she was asked about interviews she

gave to the Daily Mail eight years ago. Hutchings, who has a son with autism,

hit the headlines - and attracted the attention of Tory strategists - during the

2005 general election after confronting Tony Blair about education for children

with special needs.



In one subsequent interview she is quoted as saying: "I don't care about

refugees." In another she allegedly said: "It is the minority groups that have

benefited from Labour's time in office - the immigrants, the gays, the bloody

foxes."



Of the first interview, Hutchings explained: "What I said to the Daily Mail

journalist was there is a limited pot of money, my son is very vulnerable, I'm

told he needs these services and yet that pot of money has got to stretch. That

Daily Mail journalist said to me: 'So what do you think abut immigration and

asylum seekers?' What I said was: 'I don't care about talking about asylum

seekers because I'm here to talk about my son.'"



Of the second interview she said simply: "I've never said anything about gays or

bloody foxes. . . and I don't know where that's come from." Pressed on

immigration, she said: "My thoughts about immigration are very much like the

people of this country. People are out for fairness, it's got nothing to do with

race."



She pointed out that her mother, Vicky, is from Malta and continued: "We have a

very good record of caring about people coming to this country. But we are going

though very difficult times and people want to be sure that they are getting the

most they can get for their families."



Asked if immigration should be limited she replied: "Yes, which is what we are

doing." She declined to say what the limit should be, arguing: "That is well

above my pay grade."



She spoke about the need to protect the countryside against development. On her

website she says: "Everyone wants to see new family homes, but bulldozing over

our green spaces is not way to do it."



Inevitably, the issue of Europe was brought up. Initially Hutchings managed to

bat the questions away. But as she was being ushered away by her minders, she

was asked how she would vote in a referendum and replied: "If there was a

referendum now, I would vote out."

UK is main obstacle to EU budget deal - Hollande



BYLINE: Ian Traynor in Brussels and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 416 words





Britain and France are heading for a battle at a European summit on the EU's

trillion-euro budget this week after Francois Hollande singled out the UK as the

biggest obstacle to a breakthrough agreement.



As Downing Street indicated that David Cameron would join forces with Angela

Merkel to demand cuts in the budget, the French president criticised those

calling for "swingeing cuts" while also seeking to preserve their rebates. That

was a reference to the unloved British compensation won by Margaret Thatcher in

1984.



The French leader also indirectly criticised Cameron's recent speech on Europe

pledging a referendum on UK membership of a reformed EU, stating that there

could be no "a la carte Europe".



In his first address to the European parliament in Strasbourg two days before

what is certain to be a gruelling Brussels summit of EU leaders on a new

seven-year budget, Hollande made clear that his key objective was to defend the

contested common agricultural policy which eats up almost 40% of EU spending and

of which France is the biggest beneficiary.



Hollande said he was attending the Brussels summit on Thursday and Friday

looking for a compromise agreement. "I'm told that can't happen with the United

Kingdom. But why should one country decide for the other 26?"



This week's summit follows a failed first attempt to reach a deal on the budget

in November, with the British arguing for further reductions of at least euros

30bn (£26bn) on the overall package of euros 973bn proposed by Herman Van

Rompuy, the summit chair.



Cameron, who won support for his position from the Germans, Dutch and

Scandinavians in November, told the cabinet yesterday that spending needed to be

reduced below the Van Rompuy proposal. The prime minister, who spoke to Merkel

on Sunday, warned ministers that negotiations are often difficult and can take

time.



His spokesman said: "The position is very much that of November where we were

working with countries such as Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany

because we all agree that spending needs to be reduced further. It is something

the prime minister and the German chancellor reiterated on Sunday. In terms of

reaching agreement - these negotiations have always been difficult. They can

often take considerable time."



But in a sign that Britain could be a more isolated this week, Merkel is to go

to Paris today to try thrash out a deal with Hollande ahead of the summit.

G2: Losing the plot: The same-sex marriage bill has opened up deep rifts between

the different factions within the Tory party. So how do insiders view the crisis

that threatens to engulf David Cameron, asks John Harris

In November 1990, Conservative MPs brought to an end the reign of Margaret

Thatcher - and, as some still see it, their party has never been the same since.

There was an obvious rationale to what they did: though she had led them to

three general election victories, she had become an electoral liability, so

disliked and mistrusted that even her closest former colleagues now spoke out

against her. But when she was toppled, a poison seemed to enter the Conservative

soul: from thereon in, it seemed, the party had an insatiable taste for faction

fighting and plotting against its leaders, an obsession with Europe - and a

strange underlying self-loathing, perhaps born of a sudden lack of

self-confidence.



The last point is highlighted in author and columnist Geoffrey Wheatcroft's

brilliant modern history of the Conservatives, The Strange Death of Tory

England. "In one light," he writes, "the defenestration of Mrs Thatcher could be

seen as a supreme display of Tory toughness, but that was not the whole story."

He recounts the story of a Tory MP talking about her downfall with the writer

and Thatcher-confidant Paul Johnson, and expressing his dismay thus: "I'm afraid

it means we've become a party of cowards."



"And shits," replied Johnson.



"No," said the MP. "We've always been that."



History does not record the MP's identity - but whoever he was, the following

years would arguably prove him right, in both senses. John Major's turbulent

time in office speaks for itself. Between 1997 and 2005, the Conservative party

got through four leaders, often suggesting it was much more comfortable with

regicide than thinking about why it suddenly seemed to be on the wrong side of

history. But having been stabilised by the caretaker leadership of Michael

Howard and then electing David Cameron, it seemed to belatedly understand the

need to comprehensively reinvent itself, cut down on the in-fighting, "stop

banging on about Europe" and get back to being a party of power.



When Cameron successfully ran for the leadership, his slogan was "Change to win"

- but he did not quite manage that feat. Two-and-a-half years after the

Conservatives missed outright victory election in 2010, the Tories seem to be in

danger of resuming their old habits. With Cameron's encouragement, their

obsession with Europe has been revived, and then some. There is talk of plots

against the leadership, and Conservative factions seem to multiply by the week.

Worse still, with their proposed changes to constituency boundaries having been

scuppered by the dastardly Lib Dems, there is a rising sense that the best they

can hope for at the next election is a repeat of the hellishly uncertain outcome

of 2010.



Were he to update The Strange Death, Wheatcroft tells me, the central idea of

Tory decline would still be present and correct. "In the 1990s," he says, "they

abandoned even the pretence of loyalty and unity, and just began hacking each

other apart. In a way, it's remarkable they have recovered from where they were

in the mid-90s, to be in government at all." He credits them with an often

overlooked achievement: getting a higher share of the popular vote in 2010 than

the supposedly triumphant Tony Blair managed in 2005. But in the context of

their current problems, he suggests that things hardly look glowing.



"There's a flavour of a doomed garrison about them," he says. "Even though

they're in office, they're full of irrational hatreds. And they seem to have

lost their old instinct for what kind of party to be: are they a moderate,

Christian Democrat-type party? Or are they a party that yearns to be Ukip?"



Today, the House of Commons will vote on the proposals for same-sex marriage

that Cameron has decided to talk up as a symbol of whether his "modernisation"

project still amounts to anything. On Sunday, he was visited at Downing Street

by a deputation of outraged senior Tory activists, and up to half his MPs -

including as many as four members of the cabinet - are expected to oppose the

measure, leaving it dependent on Labour and Lib Dem support.



Among the more elevated protests against the plans is a report co-authored by

the conservative philosopher Roger Scruton and Phillip Blond, the policy thinker

who was once celebrated as one of Cameron's intellectual gurus, thanks to the

school of thought he called "Red Tory". When he launched his thinktank

ResPublica, Blond was joined by Cameron; at around the same time, Cameron quoted

Blond in at least one of his speeches, and credited his ideas with providing

some of the intellectual substance for that long-faded notion, the "big

society".



But no more. In modern Tory politics, it seems, friendships might not last for

long, and reputations can quickly wax and wane. As Blond sees it, Cameron has

taken the wrong path in two ways: carrying on the zealous free-marketry that

defined the Tories under Thatcher, and embracing the metropolitan liberalism of

New Labour, as evidenced by today's vote in the Commons. While doing so, Blond

suggests, he has lost any sense of a coherent project, and fomented endless Tory

dissent. "By failing to lead intellectually, Cameron risks not leading at all,"

he says. "He's failed to develop on the initial insights that he had, and he

hasn't come up with principles that people could unify around. So of course

there's disunity. If you don't have a coherent programme at the top, you're

going to get division at the bottom."



Conservative politics did not used to be like this. There were regular outbreaks

of internal strife, for sure. But until the arrival of Thatcher, the Tories were

a party of power: pragmatic, flexible, supremely confident - and rarely moved to

the extent of passion by much more than vague patriotism and a sense of their

own importance. The party-at-large was more of a giant social club than a

political organisation, and the people at the top often cleaved to the mindset

beautifully captured by Arthur Balfour, the Tory prime minister between 1902 and

1905: "Nothing matters very much, and most things don't matter at all."



For most of the past century, it was Labour that was most often distracted by

internal strife, something that prompted the senior party figure and political

diarist Richard Crossman to bemoan the different ways that each of the titans of

British politics responded to political difficulties. "When the Tories are in

trouble," he wrote in 1956, "they bunch together and cogger up. When we get into

trouble, we start blaming each other and rushing to the press to tell them all

the terrible things that somebody else has done."



Were Crossman alive six decades on, he would presumably laugh like a horse at

how much things have changed. For the moment at least, Labour is strangely quiet

and apparently united. Even though they are in power, it's the Tories who are

riven by factional divisions, and prone to huge bust-ups. Whatever is happening,

there is little sign of anyone wanting to "cogger up", and lots of examples of

people rushing to the newspapers - or, rather, Twitter and the fantastically

influential website ConservativeHome - to tell tales, and worse.



Cameron's recent promise of an



in/out referendum on the EU was presumably meant to calm Tory nerves, but last

week brought claims that a rebellious hardcore of Conservatives are toying with

two big ideas: a no-confidence motion in Cameron if the party's standing hasn't

materially improved by the summer of 2014, and a more immediate demand for the

sacking of chancellor George Osborne if March's budget fails to work any

economic magic.



By way of a strange punchline to the story, there is also the whirl of whispers

surrounding Adam Afriyie, the backbench MP whom very few people had heard of,

until he was suddenly being talked up as someone who might be a "stalking horse"

candidate prepared to topple the prime minister, a serious prospect for the

leadership, or a glorious example of delusions of grandeur. "The plot is all

completely mad, but No 10 really need to listen," said one anxious MP quoted in

the Daily Telegraph. "I'm afraid they simply don't understand their

backbenchers. What is most significant is that some people feel the need to do

this." That's pretty much spot on, though it ignores the figure who must surely

haunt Cameron like a tousle-headed ghost, and whose current absence from

parliament makes his position all the more interesting: Boris Johnson, whose

last big public intervention was an apparently harsh critique of Osborne's

approach to the economy.



Rather than being a unifying, broad-church kind of leader, Cameron has turned

out to be a divisive figure, widely disliked among some MPs for his supposedly

haughty style of party management - and mistrusted because of his failure to

bring the Conservatives an outright majority. Moreover, internal dissent now has

a habit of spilling out thanks to modern means of communication, and the fact

that the political right were much earlier adopters of the web and social media

than the left: among their other talents, modern Tories are Olympic-standard

tweeters, bloggers and Facebook-ists, and still much better at online

manoeuvring than Labour people.



There are also Conservative factions and tendencies ("ginger groups", they used

to be called) aplenty, a sure sign of a party that is at risk of losing any

coherent sense of itself. The long-standing Cornerstone Group has a strapline

that reads "Faith, flag and family", and has weekly meetings with the No Turning

Back Group (Thatcherites), and the 92 Group, a very long-standing rightwing

faction so named because they used to meet at 92 Cheyne Walk in Chelsea - which,

as devotees of Tory trivia may know, was a house that belonged to the late Tory

politician Sir Patrick Henry Bligh Wall.



Just along from them are the newly formed Conservative Voice, who seem to want

to re-acquaint the Tories with blue-collar voters, and who educate their people

via what their website calls a "campaign gym". There is also the Free Enterprise

Group (more Thatcherites), the Eurosceptic Fresh Start Group and the

Cameron-supporting 301 group, named after the number of MPs who would have been

needed for a Tory majority in 2015, had the Lib Dems not ratted on them and

killed the boundary changes that would have substantially increased the chances

of a Tory win. For the sake of thoroughness, we should also include Bright Blue,

a self-styled "grassroots movement" that "wants the Conservative party to keep

on modernising", and seems to be a clearing-house for young would-be Cameroons.



Most important, perhaps, is the aforementioned Conservative Home, the

website-cum-movement whose figurehead is Tim Montgomerie, the man who briefly

served under Iain Duncan Smith's leadership as his chief of staff, before going

on to position himself as the voice of Tory activists. It may be some measure of

the febrile state of Tory politics that Montgomerie is one of the most

influential Conservative voices, who torments the leadership on a regular basis.

Yesterday, he was orating from the pages of the Times, arguing that the Tories

were in a "fundamentally unhealthy" state, that Cameron's modernisation project

"has been conducted casually", and that the prime minister's political machine

"has the attention span of a goldfish".



Montgomerie is also a high-profile supporter of Johnson, whose most notable

contributions to last year's Tory party conference were a frenzied "Boris

rally", and a new website that crystallised his view of the correct Tory path,

with its url reminiscent of the political satire The Thick of It:

strongandcompassionate.com. What Cameron thinks of Montgomerie is not a matter

of record, though his constant manoeuvrings may bring to mind what Lyndon B

Johnson famously said of advisers to President Kennedy: "They may be just as

intelligent as you say. But I'd feel a helluva lot better if just one of them

had ever run for sheriff."



All this makes for an unstable, often rancourous atmosphere. It means that any

hot Tory issue - gay marriage, Europe, the government's economic direction -

tends to be the subject of pamphlets, meetings, essays, angry blogs and oceans

of tweets. To be fair to the Tories, their party's political culture is brimming

with ideas and passion: compared with the deathly dull events staged by Labour

and the Lib Dems, their conference last year was by far and away the most

intellectually stimulating and entertaining. But the question demands to be

asked: what kind of future does this internal bickering suggest?



Yesterday, I spoke at length to one senior cabinet minister and Cameron ally. He

warned against reading too much ideological substance into the internal Tory

factions: "They seem to me to be grouped around individuals, and the principle

division is between people who are, to a lesser or greater extent, pro-Cameron

and the government, and those who are anti-him." They range, he continued, from

people who have "positions of principle" to those "who have personal reasons for

disliking the government, some of whom are very passionate".



He made comparisons to the internal Labour dissent that eventually did for

Blair, which prompted an obvious enough question: why is Cameron facing such a

restive party so soon into his first term? "The first thing is, because we

didn't win," he replies. Cameron, he says, was blamed for the simple existence

of the coalition and an election result that has hardened a kind of betrayal

myth held dear by more hard-bitten Tories: "The idea that if he'd fought a

better campaign, and he'd been a truer Tory, we could have been in a position

where we could have indulged ourselves."



Is all the plotting and faction-fighting a worry? "It's important to be neither

complacently dismissive of it - 'Oh, it happens all the time' - nor to panic or

obsess. The most important thing is to try to appreciate why it's arisen and

what can be done about it." Courtesy and engagement, he says, were always

important, but at the same time, "you cannot reason someone out of a position

which they haven't reasoned themselves into. And lots of people hold the view

they do about David and the rest of us because the instinct and emotion come

first and the intellectual justification comes afterwards."



The scale of dissent over gay marriage, he agrees, is a problem. "It's not a

good look to have a party arguing among itself. And it's not a good look if some

of the people arguing, and delivering letters, are delivering letters on this.

If you have a Labour government, and you have a group of people handing letters

into the prime minister - it might be to, say, save nurseries - now, you might

say: 'Well, this is an example of a sentimental lack of reality at a time of

economic pain,' but at least you don't think: 'The bastards.' Whereas, there is

a section of the population that see this, and thinks: 'The one thing they'll

give up their weekend for is to say that gay people shouldn't get married.'



"Without wanting to be Pollyanna-ish about it," he continues, "if you have a

group of people who just don't like you, saying that you simply don't deserve to

be prime minister, when this issue passes, they'll just find another one."

Dissent and periodic turbulence, then, would go on - but, he reckons, there will

be no leadership plots this side of the next election.



We shall see. At the moment, the Conservative party occasionally brings to mind

the Labour party of the 1980s, which was similarly faction-ridden, very

ideological and full of feuds that were often as much personal as political.

Among the Tories' current opponents, then, there is a pronounced tendency to

assume that the forces of history will once against assert themselves, Cameron's

time in government will be no more than a blip, and Labour will soon be back in

office.



But that ignores some things about the Tories that remain firmly in place.

First, the people in charge are a lot cleverer than some people would like to

think. Second, they remain the party of the powerful, backed not just by huge

economic interests, but most of the press, who may sometimes make Cameron's life

more difficult than he would prefer, but will come running once the next

election comes into view. This strange mixture of strife and power, then, may

yet continue - in which case, just wait until that Europe referendum, when all

the Tories' post-Thatcher tensions may well explode, making their current woes

look like an unimaginable period of love and peace.

Front: Tories tell PM: lift poll ratings or face revolt: Cameron given until

summer 2014 to avert backbench confidence vote



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt, Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 806 words





Downing Street has been warned that David Cameron risks facing a confidence vote

over his leadership in the summer of 2014 if his poll ratings fail to improve

and the party performs poorly in the local elections.



A diehard group of party rebels, who would like to remove the prime minister

immediately, will significantly grow in numbers over the next 17 months if the

Tories fail to achieve a breakthrough, according to MPs inside and outside the

government.



An incipient Tory rebellion was blown into the open this week when a leadership

campaign by the former shadow science minister Adam Afriyie was exposed by the

Mail on Sunday. The campaign, which was hoping to collect 120 signed letters in

support of the millionaire MP for Windsor, has been widely derided by MPs who

have said that it would be "mad" for the party to turn to a relative unknown who

has never held ministerial office. Cameron made light of the challenge this

week, telling MPs: "The Conservative party has always stood for people who want

to work hard and get on and I'm glad that all of those behind me take that very

seriously indeed."



But the Guardian understands from members of the government and from prominent

backbenchers that there is a growing belief that enough MPs are prepared to

trigger a vote of confidence in the prime minister in the summer of 2014 if the

Tories experience a setback in the local elections.



Such a contest would be triggered automatically if 46 MPs - 15% of the

parliamentary party - write to the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady.



One MP said: "There is a core of MPs that is determined to get rid of Cameron

right now. They think he lost the last election, they think he cannot win the

next election and maybe doesn't even want to win the election. They think he

just likes the idea of being a coalition prime minister.



"While this group are wrong to think of a move now, there would be support for a

contest if there is no movement for the party by 2014. There would be no problem

in drumming up 46 letters to Graham Brady at that point. I could name them. I

would support it."



The MP voiced the hope that the prime minister would revive his and the party's

fortunes. "Maybe Cameron will turn things round. He is very good when his back

is against the wall. But he is hopeless at managing the team room."



One member of the government said of the rebels: "This is not necessarily about

waiting until 2015 and seeing if David Cameron loses. This is about being ready

for the moment when the party realises that Cameron is not a winner."



The MP said that while the Afriyie campaign was not credible, it had touched a

nerve as the party looked to a future where it could be led by someone whose

background contrasts dramatically with Cameron's.



"Colleagues are fed up with the posh boys. They do not look like the country. I

would love it if a working class guy of mixed race became our leader. It would

say to Labour - wrong again. We had the first woman leader, the first Jewish

leader and now the first black leader."



The manoeuvring has exposed divisions among supporters of Afriyie. The former

frontbencher maintains that he only ever intended to stand if Cameron resigned

after losing the 2015 election. But some of his supporters want to unseat

Cameron now.



Loyalists insist that the Afriyie campaign had ended up strengthening the prime

minister.



One member of the government said: "What this week has done is guarantee that

David Cameron will lead us into the next election. The Afriyie campaign is mad

and far too premature." But the MP added: "Clearly there are MPs who want David

out."



One minister said: "I have been involved in Conservative politics for 20 years.

The Conservative party is never not plotting."



Others were more dismissive. One prominent backbencher said: "David Cameron will

lead us into the next election. These people are somewhat deluded. What is their

problem?



"The prime minister has an incredibly difficult job and he has just promised us

a referendum on our membership of the EU with a deadline."



The prospect of a leadership contest will focus attention on Brady whose

predecessor, Sir Michael Spicer, was chairman of the 1922 Committee when a vote

of confidence triggered the downfall of Iain Duncan Smith in 2003.



It is understood that Brady already has a handful of letters in his safe calling

for a vote of confidence in Cameron. At least one MP sacked from the Tory

frontbench by Cameron has written. But Brady is praised by Cameron and by MPs

across the party for being the soul of discretion.



The events of the past weeks have also clarified in the minds of senior Tories

that George Osborne enjoys negligible support on the Tory benches should he

decide to stand.

Letter: The dangers of intervention in Mali



BYLINE: Martin Pick



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 37



LENGTH: 141 words





* In his otherwise excellent article on al-Qaida (The war on fear, 29 January),

I fear that Jason Burke gives David Cameron the benefit of too much doubt when

he refers to his comments simply as "dated". Cameron knows exactly what he is

doing. As a consummate PR man, he is appealing to the fear of the Other in a bid

to try to ensure he is re-elected in 2015. He is doing the same in relation to

the in-out EU referendum. As George Monbiot (Comment, 29 January) suggests,

Cameron thinks he has a divine right to govern but even he realises he must win

the next election first.



Articles in the same edition on the destruction of manuscripts and Sufi shrines

in Mali (and even the obituary of Stanley Cohen) show why such issues are

important and why appeals to xenophobia for short-term political expediency must

not pass unchallenged.

National: Ex-chancellor who brought down Thatcher attacks PM on Europe: Howe

comes out against plan for EU referendum: Coalition near breakdown over justice

opt-outs



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt and Alan Travis



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 663 words





Lord Howe, the former chancellor who brought down Lady Thatcher, in part over

Europe, has criticised David Cameron's plan to hold a referendum on Britain's EU

membership.



As the former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown said that the Tories were

intent on taking Britain out of the EU, Howe said that parliament should have

the final say over the UK's place in Europe.



The intervention by the two prominent pro-Europeans in a House of Lords debate

on Europe came amid signs that coalition talks are close to breakdown over

whether Britain will exercise its opt-out of EU police and criminal justice

measures. The Guardian has learned that talks between Danny Alexander of the Lib

Dems and Oliver Letwin of the Tories have effectively broken down over which of

the 130 measures are regarded as so vital that Britain would immediately ask

Brussels for permission to opt back into them.



Howe questioned Cameron's plan to hold a referendum by the end of 2017 if he

wins the next general election. The former chancellor, who prompted Michael

Heseltine to challenge Thatcher in 1990, told peers: "I would like to think I

was wrong in suspecting that the prime minister's sudden conversion to the

merits of a referendum is less about occupying the moral high ground of

democratic consent than the search for a means to overcome the problems of

internal party management."



Howe, who steered through the EEC accession bill as attorney general in Ted

Heath's government in the early 1970s, added: "I don't believe a referendum is

the way in which to address this question. Our own national parliament . . . not

a widely consulted referendum, is the true source of democratic legitimacy and

accountability."



Ashdown spoke of a "virulent little Englander" movement in the Conservative

party, which "want out altogether". He added: "The difference between Britain

and the rest is we are negotiating wanting to get out, while the rest of them

are negotiating wanting to get further in."



The prime minister came under fire in the Lords as the US administration

reiterated its belief that Britain should remain an active member of the EU. An

adviser to Joe Biden, the US vice-president who is to visit Britain next week,

said: "Obviously it's up to member states of the EU to make their own decisions.

With respect to prime minister Cameron's speech, we obviously support his

comments about the important role of the UK in the EU. We leave it to EU member

states to have discussions."



Another US official said: "It's in our interest for there to be a strong UK in a

strong EU."



The remarks echo the intervention by Philip Gordon, the US assistant secretary

for European affairs, who said that the US wanted Britain to remain an active

member of the EU.



The calls from the US came as coalition divisions over Europe risked scuppering

negotiations over British co-operation on EU police and criminal justice

measures. Both sides of the coalition agree that Britain should exercise a

right, granted by the Lisbon treaty, to opt out of around 130 justice and home

affairs (JHA) measures. But the Liberal Democrats will not sanction this mass

opt-out unless the Tories agree to opt back in to key measures such as the

European arrest warrant.



A source with knowledge of the talks has confirmed that "they are not making a

great deal of progress; they are having to work through the package on a

case-by-case basis".



A breakdown over the issue has serious implications for David Cameron's strategy

on Europe, as this is one of the main matters on which he was hoping to secure

Leaving EU would be 'fatal mistake', warns Clarke: UK 'can achieve more in

Europe than on our own' Mandelson, Alexander also advise against no vote



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 586 words





Kenneth Clarke, the veteran pro-European former Tory chancellor, has warned that

Britain would be making a "fatal mistake" if it voted to leave the EU in the

referendum promised by David Cameron.



In a direct challenge to the prime minister, who is pledging to hold the poll

after repatriating a raft of powers from the EU by the end of 2017, Clarke said

Britain should focus on the positive benefits of the EU. "We need to concentrate

on what we are in favour of and just what we are against," Clarke said at the

launch of a new cross-party group, British Influence.



The former chancellor re-enacted one of the most controversial episodes of his

career yesterday evening when he shared a platform with Lord Mandelson and the

Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander at the launch of the new group.



Alexander was press officer for the Britain in Europe campaign group in 1999

when Clarke killed off his chances of ever leading the Tory party by sharing a

platform with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.



In his speech, Clarke was careful to praise the prime minister, who has recently

asked him to help press for a new EU-US free trade agreement. Clarke held talks

on this at a recent EU-Latin America summit in Chile with Karel de Gucht, the

European trade commissioner.



The former chancellor said that Cameron was right to say in his landmark speech

last week on Britain and Europe that the EU could reform. But he made it clear

that Britain must be an active player.



"When the UK plays an active, leading role in Europe, we can achieve enormous

things which we simply could not on our own," Clarke said. "So the real

challenge for us as we debate our role in the EU is working out what we should

be pushing forward, what we should be leading on within the EU, to make it - and

us - a more effective economic and global power."



Clarke called on pro-Europeans to make the case for the EU more effectively as

he called for the fulfilment of Margaret Thatcher's two key European ambitions -

completing the single market and expanding the EU by admitting Turkey.



"The time has obviously now come for us to put the case more strongly and more

coherently," he said. "It is in our vital national interest that we avoid the

fatal mistake that would be a no vote if a referendum is held in the next few

years."



In his speech, Mandelson claimed that Eurosceptics had "got away with murder".

The former European trade commissioner said: "For far too long, those who want

to destroy Britain's interests and influence in Europe have been allowed to get

away with murder with the lies and false propaganda they have poured out about

the European Union and what it represents for our country. This cannot go

unchallenged any more. The pro-Europeans have bided their time. Now we must

unbide our time."



Alexander made clear the Liberal Democrats' deep unease at the prime minister's

plan when he warned of the dangers posed by those who "put anti-European

ideology ahead of our national interest". He said: "We cannot afford to give the

impression that we are going to disengage. Britain's national interest demands

that we maximise our influence and use that influence to boost growth, trade and

jobs.



"That is the only way to protect British jobs. It's a position that is

pro-business and pro-Britain too. It should be obvious to all that we are more

powerful negotiating from inside Europe than from the sidelines."

Reply: Letter: We don't need an EU referendum



BYLINE: Neil Kinnock

LENGTH: 241 words





Vernon Bogdanor is right that referendums are justified on proposals to change

the way in which we are governed, but wrong to conclude that "Labour must back

this vote" (Comment, 28 January). No one in the UK, the other member states or

the EU institutions is seeking treaty amendment or any alteration to governance

of the UK. This vote has nothing to do with such profound issues. David

Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum in several years' time, on issues

yet to be identified and negotiated, by a government yet to be elected, has not

been made in pursuit of legitimacy or certainty or, indeed, democracy. It is

because he is more willing to risk the wellbeing of the UK as an investment

location than to face down the militant Europhobes in his party.



Labour, as Professor Bogdanor says, was "formed to combat the power of elites".

That is why there is strong support in the UK and other EU labour movements for

the major advances in working conditions and rights, environmental standards,

consumer protection, improving banking rules and supervision, and many other EU

achievements. Many of those obligations on employers and business are also among

the prime reasons for Tory anti-EU zeal. Professor Bogdanor and others who

support sustained UK engagement in the EU should recognise that, resist the

siren call of Cameron's referendum and focus on stopping his reckless wheeze by

beating the Tories in 2015.

EU referendum plan brings warning from defence and aerospace firms



BYLINE: Dan Milmo Industrial editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 19



LENGTH: 536 words





Britain's most powerful aerospace, defence and security companies have joined

the debate over Europe in the wake of David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out

referendum on Britain's EU membership, by warning that the government must

ensure close co-operation with its biggest trading partner.



The head of ADS, the trade association for major manufacturing names such as BAE

Systems, Babcock and GKN, will state that British companies are "at the heart"

of Europe's aerospace industry. The comments by Robin Southwell, the ADS

chairman, will be given extra credence by his day-to-day role as the chief

executive of UK operations at EADS, the Franco-German industrial conglomerate

that owns Airbus, one of Britain's biggest manufacturing employers.



In a speech at the ADS annual dinner tonight, Southwell will say: "As we debate

Britain's role in Europe in the years to come, what we should not question is

our role at the heart of the European aerospace sector. After all, if you look

at both exports and imports, the eurozone does more business with the UK than

with any other trading bloc. How many of you know that the UK recently overtook

France and the US to become Germany's single largest trading partner?"



He adds: "If that doesn't place us at the heart of Europe, then nothing does. So

whatever the outcome for Britain's role in Europe, we must ensure that we remain

part of the European economic community in protecting opportunities for

investment, partnership and growth in our sector."



The failure last year of the euros 35bn (£30bn) merger between EADS and BAE

Systems, Britain's biggest defence contractor, has stoked fears within

government and industrial circles that work on the next generation of Airbus

aircraft, as well as other big aerospace and defence projects, will drift away

from the UK. Airbus employs about 10,000 people in the UK, largely at its wing

manufacturing plant in Broughton, north Wales, and at its design and testing

facility in Filton, near Bristol.



Ministers and aerospace industry executives are drawing up a new strategy

document that is likely to include plans for an aerospace research centre, in

addition to the centre of excellence for aerodynamics announced by George

Osborne last year. The strategic update is being co-ordinated by the Aerospace

Growth Partnership, a body that brings together government ministers, officials

and UK-based aerospace companies including Rolls-Royce, the aircraft engine

maker; Bombardier, which makes plane wings in Belfast; GKN, the components

supplier; and AgustaWestland, the Yeovil-based helicopter maker.



British business leaders, including the CBI and the WPP boss, Sir Martin

Sorrell, have warned that the prime minister's promise of an in-out referendum

on the European Union in 2017 will create an atmosphere of uncertainty that

could jeopardise investment plans. ADS represents the aerospace, defence,

security and space industries in the UK, which are among the biggest employers

in the British economy. Aerospace and defence companies alone employ about

400,000 people in the UK and generate about £60bn for the British economy,

according to ADS.

Comment: Labour must back this vote: The party's history shows that a referendum

can help it bring Europe's elite project back to the people



BYLINE: Vernon Bogdanor



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 24



LENGTH: 728 words





The constitutional argument for a referendum on Europe is clear. We elect MPs to

make decisions in parliament on our behalf, but not to transfer the powers of

parliament to other bodies. That is why the transfer of legislative powers

downwards, through devolution, requires a referendum. So also, since the

European Union Act 2011, does the transfer of powers upwards to the EU.



But since we entered Europe in 1975, numerous powers have been transferred

without our consent. And the referendum requirement poses a particular dilemma

for a party of the left, which seeks to be both internationalist and sensitive

to the demands of the people. That is why Labour has always had a bad conscience

about Europe.



In 1962 its leader Hugh Gaitskell famously declared that a federal Europe would

end "1,000 years of history". His successor Harold Wilson agreed but in office

sought - unsuccessfully - to enter Europe. In opposition he veered again,

opposing entry in 1973 on "Tory terms", but uniting the party through the device

of the referendum which, in 1975, yielded a two-to-one majority for Europe - the

greatest triumph pro-Europeans have ever enjoyed.



In opposition, however, Labour swung again and, in 1981, proposed leaving Europe

without a referendum - one of the issues that led to the SDP breakaway, helping

to put Labour in opposition for 18 years. Michael Foot and Tony Benn put their

prejudices on Europe above the needs of social democracy. Today pro-Europeans

must avoid doing the same.



On no issue has there consistently been a greater gap between the people and the

political class than Europe. Survey evidence shows that a large minority, and in

some polls a majority, want to leave the EU; but, in the Commons, only a small

minority of MPs favour exit. On Europe, parliament no longer represents the

people.



Critics say that the referendum will lead to uncertainty which is bad for

investment. But without popular endorsement, Britain's position in Europe is

bound to be enveloped in permanent uncertainty, so weakening its chances of

constructive engagement.



The EU, moreover, is in flux. Britain cannot remain unaffected if the eurozone

moves towards banking union. The eurozone in any case remains highly unstable,

and Greece, along with other Mediterranean states, might well exit.



Britain has, of course, always been the awkward partner. There are good reasons.

They were summed up by President de Gaulle when, 50 years ago this month, he

proclaimed his veto. De Gaulle declared that the Treaty of Rome had been signed

by six "continental states . . . which were of the same nature". Britain, by

contrast, was "insular, she is maritime, she is linked through her exchanges,

her markets, her supply lines, to the most diverse and often the most distant

countries; she pursues essentially industrial and commercial activities, and

only slight agricultural ones". That was why she was so opposed to the Common

Agricultural Policy.



De Gaulle concluded that "the nature, the structure, the very situation that are

England's differ profoundly from those of the continentals". But he accepted

that Britain might, in the future, evolve "little by little towards the

continent". The referendum will test whether Britain has done so.



There is a fundamental decision to be made and only the British people can make

it. Europe has for too long been an elite project. The pro-Europeans have been

content to win the argument in the corridors of power. That is why, since 1975,

the argument has been lost by default. But Labour was formed to combat the power

of elites, not to yield to it.



The constitutional argument for the referendum is based fundamentally on the

need for legitimacy. Some decisions are so momentous that they cannot be decided

by MPs alone, but need popular endorsement. It is difficult to think of a more

momentous issue than whether Britain should remain in the EU.



Harold Wilson's policy adviser, Bernard Donoughue, said that, while Edward Heath

took the British establishment into Europe, it needed Wilson to take the British

people into Europe. Today the political and financial establishment remain

committed to Europe, but the people are leaving in droves. That is the basic

case for the referendum and the left should support it.

PM will grab your EU rights to destroy them, says TUC boss: O'Grady calls on

unions in Europe to fight Cameron Focus on UK economy instead, warns Clegg



BYLINE: Rajeev Syal



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 670 words





David Cameron will use EU reforms to repatriate and weaken workers' rights,

Frances O'Grady, the new leader of the Trades Union Congress will warn today .



Speaking at a conference in Madrid she will say that, if the prime minister gets

his way, employees across Europe may no longer receive health and safety

protection, equal treatment as part-time workers and women, or paid holidays.



The TUC general secretary's words come after Nick Clegg yesterday warned his

coalition partner that a promise to hold a referendum on EU membership risked

damaging the fragile economy.



Cameron said on Wednesday that he wanted to stay in the EU but pledged to claw

back powers and offer voters the choice of a new relationship or an exit by the

end of 2017 if the Conservatives were back in power in 2015. His stance

delighted Eurosceptic backbenchers.



O'Grady will tell the European Trades Union Congress that Cameron has already

made it easier for employers to sack people and more difficult for workers to

get justice in the courts.



She will state: "There's one set of workers' rights David Cameron can't touch.

Those are the rights provided for by social Europe - paid holidays, health and

safety, equal treatment for part-time workers and women, protection when a

business is sold off, and a voice at work. The prime minister wants to

repatriate those rights, and not because he thinks he can improve them. Cameron

wants to make it easier for bad employers to undercut good ones, drive down

wages, and make people who already work some of the longest hours in Europe work

even longer. To do that he needs agreement from the rest of Europe."



She will urge European unions to mount campaigns in their own countries against

Cameron's reforms. "What (he) is trying to do isn't just opt out of social

Europe, he wants to undercut it."



Clegg yesterday dismissed prospects of securing a significant renegotiation and

suggested that Cameron should concentrate on the economy.



Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, the Liberal Democrat leader said Cameron

was engaged in an "arcane" debate about the precise terms of the membership of

the EU. "It is not in the national interest when we have this fragile recovery,

when we have a very open economy which is very dependent on investors in the car

industry and the banking system and so on. You must always, when you are trying

to piece together a recovery, foster those precarious conditions of greater

confidence in the economy."



He claimed most businesses he had spoken to were worried by the uncertainty

concerning a referendum and its consequences. "Is it deliverable to, in effect,

say to the rest of the EU: we want to do all the bits that we like, but can you

keep all the stuff that we think is not good for the economy? That is not

plausible."



Grant Shapps, the Tory chairman, said the government was not ignoring the

country's economic position by developing a new policy on Europe. "Europe is a

big central issue which has a major effect on most people's daily lives," he

told Dermot Murnaghan on Sky News.



Later, speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he raised the possibility of Britain

leaving the EU if renegotiations fail. "I think most people in this country

agree that Europe isn't what we originally signed up for. If we can't get any

powers back at all, then we'll be in a different position," he said.



Meanwhile, Ed Miliband, Labour's leader, defended his opposition to a referendum

on the EU. "Right now it doesn't make sense to commit to a referendum years

ahead.



"Has (Cameron) changed his mind because he's changed his view about the national

economic interest? Or has he changed his mind because he's worried about Ukip? I

contend it's the second, not the first."



A ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday put the Tories up

five points on 33% following Cameron's speech. Labour was unchanged, with 39%,

but its lead had slipped from 11 points to six in a month. Ukip's support has

fallen.

Backbencher forced to deny reports of plot to oust Cameron



BYLINE: Rajeev Syal



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 307 words





It was the coup that never was. Rumours had been circulating in Westminster that

with the Tories behind in the polls, a challenger could take on David Cameron.



Yesterday morning, a name emerged from the shadows in two right-leaning

newspapers - and it was not Boris Johnson, Michael Gove or any of the big names.



It was Adam Afriyie, the suave multimillionaire MP for Windsor, who within hours

was rather keen to insist he had no designs on Downing Street as a "stalking

horse candidate" if the Tories fail to deliver a majority government in 2015.



Both the Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Times had claimed he had a campaign team

in place and backbenchers were being asked to sign a pledge of support in

expectation of a future leadership challenge.



After several hours of speculation, Afriyie appeared on Sky News to say he had

held regular talks with colleagues "about the long-term future of the party" but

rejected suggestions he was being lined up as part of any plot to oust its

leader.



"I will never stand against David Cameron, I am 100% supportive of David Cameron

and I am working with many colleagues but to make sure we give the Conservatives

the best chance of winning . . . the 2015 election," he told Sky News.



"When you are working with an organised team to try to achieve something

positive for the party and for David Cameron, it is inevitable that all sorts of

rumours leak out. There is no truth to any of it."



The newspaper reports and Afriyie's qualified denial of them, will concern No

10. The prime minister's supporters have been trying to argue this week that he

has won over the parliamentary party with a promise for a future EU referendum.



Afriyie, who is worth £50m-£100m, grew up in poverty in Peckham, south-east

London, the son of an English mother and a Ghanaian father. Elected in 2005, he

was the first black Tory MP.

Financial: Nils Pratley on Saturday: Apple has reached its peak - but is it the

start of a rot?



BYLINE: Nils Pratley



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 27



LENGTH: 1158 words





A little sympathy for Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, is in order. Following

Steve Jobs was never going to be easy, but he has hardly been helped by the hype

and expectation piled on the company. Yes, Apple exploits the mood merrily when

it has a new gizmo to flog. But Wall Street as showbiz on steroids can be an

absurd spectacle. At Apple, the machine has been in ridiculous overdrive for the

past year.



The first sign was analysts competing to be the first to predict a $1,000 share

price. Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets was the winner, declaring "Apple

fever is spreading like a wildfire around the world". Others piled in.



Given the size of the company and its weight in various indices, not owning the

shares suddenly became a career risk for the average US fund manager. Who would

want to be the fool who stood alone against the iPhone 5?



At $700 the stock was clearly priced for perfection. After a small slip - a

wonky mapping app - the machine went into reverse. With tech stocks there is no

neutral gear -they are either on their way to the moon, or they are ex-growth

companies that have run out of ideas.



So this week's numbers were greeted as evidence of the latter - a confirmation

Apple has peaked. It is true that quarterly profits were flat year on year at

$13.1bn (£8bn) and that the annual outcome could be the first decline for a

decade. Higher manufacturing costs are a fact of life and Samsung, which has put

a dent in Apple's profit margins, is a formidable competitor. The shares fell

another 12% to $450.



But take a step back. After the ride on Wall Street's rollercoaster, Apple's

shares stand almost exactly where they did a year ago. For a company in

transition, that is hardly humiliation. The ex-growth label may sting but it is

the rate of decline that matters. Middle age comes to everybody and handing out

the winnings (Apple has $137bn in cash) in the form of dividends or buy-backs

would be no disgrace.



But can anybody really be confident Apple is ex-growth and the 48m iPhones sold

in the past quarter represent a last hurrah? It is far too early to judge. The

big event is the next product - it always is. Is it television? That has been

the buzz for the past year but nothing has appeared. Is that because the

in-house tech geniuses have come up short, or because the chief executive knows

better than to talk casually? Nobody knows.



But give the guy a break. It is fair to beat up Cook for failing to spot, until

now, potential child-labour abuses in the supply chain (see page 1). But it is

too soon to conclude that Apple's innovation pipeline is broken, or that the

firm has lost its appetite for taking development risks. That verdict will have

to wait a year or two. In Wall Street terms, that's an eternity. But Cook would

be foolish to try to run Apple to Wall Street's timetable.



EU conundrum



Does a possible referendum on membership of the EU represent a terrible threat

to inward investment in the UK? Does half a decade in limbo await? No and no.



OK, an attempted assassination of Ukip is not an uplifting way to launch the EU

debate. But the notion that the "uncertainty" over membership is a game-changer

for inward investment in the UK isn't persuasive. First, there is uncertainty

wherever you look on the European battleground. Mario Draghi at the European

Central Bank has dampened the flames of the eurozone crisis but only an extreme

optimist would say he has extinguished them.



The eurozone is travelling from monetary union to fiscal union. "Ever-closer

union" means what it says. Any non-European investor will look at that journey

and wonder if, when, at what cost, it will be completed. Will Germany really

choose to lock itself into a federalised budget union with Italy, Spain,

Portugal and Greece? If it doesn't, the economics of a shiny new German car

factory, say, are very different.



Second, what if the UK did leave the EU? It remains a possibility but the

divorce terms would be critical. Punitive two-way tariffs seem far-fetched since

Germany has a trade surplus with Britain. Free-ish trade with Europe seems the

way to bet, whatever happens.



Third, David Cameron's gamble might succeed. From the point of view of business,

a reformed EU and a better-functioning single market, with the UK and Germany as

closer allies, would be a useful gain.



Yes, the prime minister's political calculation could backfire. But Angela

Merkel's polite reception to the speech was the important development. In any

risk/reward assessment, the chance of helpful reforms to the single market have

to be included.



The real threat to inward investment in the UK is simple. Foreign investors are

attracted by growth. At the moment, they will see a flat-on-its-back economy and

a government short of ideas. A possible referendum, to be held after several

more chapters of the unpredictable eurozone crisis, will seem like a sideshow.



Tax transparency



Well done, Justin King at Sainsbury's and Dalton Philips at Morrisons. They seem

to be the FTSE 100 chief executives most keen to embrace the idea of companies

giving a country-by-country account of where they pay tax. The rest of the

bunch, to judge by the letters made public by Conservative MP Stephen

McPartland, hate this definition of tax transparency. Ian Livingston at BT does

not like the administrative cost, and Rupert Soames at Aggreko thinks giving

country-by-country detail is "unworkable" for his company.



At least the prime minister, campaigning against corporate tax avoidance, now

knows what he is up against when he raises his plan at the G8. But surely he

could start at home. There's nothing to the stop the UK from obliging companies

operating here - say, those with a turnover of £500m-plus - to publish their UK

tax details.



The purpose? It's the pragmatic argument made by King: "Rather than developing a

new international accountancy standard, which will take a long time, I strongly

believe consumers are best placed to encourage companies to pay a fair amount of

tax in the UK." That modest idea hardly seems likely to cause an outbreak of

anti-business sentiment. There would be winners and losers - but that is the

point.



Playing a bad hand brilliantly



If "resilient dynamism", the bizarre motto of this year's Davos gathering, means

anything its quality is probably best demonstrated by Kate Swann, a chief

executive unlikely to be found clinking glasses at the Swiss jamboree. At WH

Smith, which she will leave in June, Swann has played a bad hand brilliantly.



The high street outlets, as opposed to the ones on railway stations and in

airports, have reported like-for-like sales declines every year during her

nine-year tenure. A relentless focus on costs has saved the day and kept profits

rolling.



Good luck to her successor, Steve Clarke, he's going to need it. Squeezing more

juice out of WH Smith looks a very tall order. Swann, one suspects, may have

timed her exit perfectly. She wouldn't be the first in retail-land.

Comment: Cameron's fatal mistake: As a seasoned negotiator I have seldom seen a

weaker opening hand than this Europe speech



BYLINE: Jonathan Powell



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 34



LENGTH: 687 words





Sometimes politicians are tactical rather than strategic. They seek short-term

fixes to their problems without thinking about the long-term consequences. They

get good reviews on the day but the plan soon unravels. That is certainly the

story of David Cameron's Europe speech on Wednesday. He received plaudits from

his backbenches and temporarily discomfited Ed Miliband, but at the cost of

creating long-term problems for his party and the country.



I have spent most of my life involved in diplomatic negotiations of one sort or

another, including 10 years in No 10 wrestling with EU matters. From a purely

negotiating point of view, I have seldom seen a weaker opening hand than that

which Cameron dealt Britain in his speech on Wednesday.



First, if you issue an ultimatum, the "or else" needs to be something the others

really don't want to happen. Most of the other 27 members would rather we didn't

leave the EU, but they are not going to pay a serious price to persuade us to

stay, especially if we are planning to stay partially in the union.



Second, you get your way in the EU by building alliances. Cameron's emphasis on

competitiveness as the key challenge for Europe is laudable, and widely shared.

As a "pre-in" during the Blair years, we could attract allies, for example, to

stop the French and Germans sticking the Belgian Guy Verhofstadt into the top

job. But nobody is going to want to form an alliance with Britain if we are a

"pre-out". By indicating he will leave if he doesn't get his way, Cameron has

just destroyed his chances of securing any allies.



Third, all Cameron is really saying is that if there is treaty change, there

will be a referendum. That pretty much goes without saying. We proposed a

referendum on the constitutional treaty, but then didn't have to go through with

it because the French and Dutch voted the treaty down first. It is precisely

because Angela Merkel knows that treaty change would require a referendum - not

just in Britain but in other European countries - that she is avoiding a new

treaty. If there is no new intergovernmental conference, how does Cameron get a

negotiation going inside the EU when nobody else wants one? And even if there

were to be a new treaty, the last one took 10 years to negotiate, so we wouldn't

be having a referendum till 2023.



Last, the government has said that it will set out the changes it is seeking in

its next manifesto for us all to see. So if the other Europeans were to decide

to make some concessions to help him out, it would be perfectly apparent to his

backbenches and the Eurosceptic press that he had achieved only a few cosmetic

changes. In those circumstances, how could he lead a campaign with all his

"heart and soul" for Britain to remain in Europe?



Cameron has therefore set up circumstances in which he cannot succeed. The

long-term consequences of snookering himself and the country so completely are

twofold. First, far from solving the division within the Conservative party,

this will make matters worse. Cameron has just fired the starting gun on a

five-year no campaign.



Eurosceptics will spend the intervening period doing nothing but "banging on

about Europe", and Conservative candidates at the next election will no doubt

face demands to pledge to vote to leave the EU or face a Ukip challenge. The

Corn Laws ripped the Tory party apart in the 19th century, imperial preference

(free trade within the British Empire) in the early 20th, and it looks like

Europe will do the same in the 21st.



Second, while I don't for a moment imagine Cameron wants to be the prime

minister who takes Britain out of Europe, he has set things up in such a way

that there is real risk he will do so by mistake. An in-out referendum in this

country could be won. But only with political leadership of the sort we saw in

1975. Since Cameron can't say whether he will vote yes or no until he has

secured all his demands, the field will be left to the anti campaign.



Cameron will have enjoyed the applause on Wednesday, but he and the rest of us

will come to rue the day.

Comment: Comment: A speech that told Europe's emperors to get dressed: The EU's

elder statesmen tried to run before they could walk. We may not like it, but

Cameron's call was brave and timely

Good heavens, it was a baby. The wicked fairies assumed that so long and painful

a labour meant David Cameron's Europe speech would be a limp monster all the

world would hate. Instead it is a healthy, bouncing thing, with even Cameron's

critics patting its head and admiring its dimples.



Wednesday's speech was to the point, workmanlike and devoid of fudge and

platitude. It had a clear narrative argument rare in political discourse.

Cameron must have believed in it. He threw both Labour's Ed Miliband and the

Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, off their stride.



No politician ever finds himself on the spot where he would like to be. All must

dance to the music of time. Nor can they always choose their audiences. Thus to

accuse Cameron of speaking to his party, his backbenchers or the growing horde

of defectors to Ukip is to accuse him of being no more than an ordinary

political leader. In 2011 he had 81 Tory MPs voting against him on Europe, with

public opinion apparently behind them. To expect him to ignore this fact is

naive.



Europe. not a burning issue to many Britons, matters. Had the UK joined the

euro, its currency would now be disastrously overvalued. Europe's political

engineering has to change as a result of the eurozone crisis. It may be

uncomfortable for a Briton to point this out, but Cameron is merely positioning

Britain for such a change, other countries agreeing with him below the parapet.



As for accusations of Britain wanting special treatment, of cherry picking, that

is how France and Germany have always treated Europe. France is currently

demanding the craziest "double-subsidy" farm reform in EU history, with not a

peep of objection from Brussels. Germany's guardianship of its banks, disastrous

for the Greeks among others, has been entirely self-interested. Those are not

cherries but watermelons.



In all history the conundrum of Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe

has never been resolved. This is especially true when some power has, as now,

sought "pan-European" ambitions. Proud states - and all states are proud - are

seldom at ease with a regional superpower. Almost every modern war is one of

separatism or subsidiarity, region against centre, tribe against bigger tribe:

Mali, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Chechnya, Congo. In Europe half a century

of "ever closer union" has only fuelled the separatism of Basques, Catalans,

Corsicans and Scots. Political "unions" rarely work for long.



Cameron has reiterated a clear, if hardly novel, line. He wants actively to

pursue a single European market, accepting some of the political disciplines

required for its enforcement. Not every playing field needs to be absolutely

level, he says: "We cannot harmonise everything." But he will not participate in

some deeper European federation.



This view is shared, probably, with most Britons and with millions across Europe

who view "ever closer union" with alarm. As Cameron says, "the gap between the

EU and its citizens has grown dramatically". That is the message of the 2005

French and Dutch referendums, of others in Ireland and Denmark and countless

opinion polls. Subsidiarity, devolving power to member states "from within", has

not happened. The only power shift has been towards ever greater bureaucracy.



There must be a point where the burden on industry and commerce of regulatory

compliance outweighs the advantage of a supposedly more open market. It is

already crippling Europe's less efficient states and is making all Europe

uncompetitive with the world. The last war is over. The virtues of economic

union should be a matter of fact, of evidence, not ideology. The EU is an

economy, not a faith. It should have arguments, not jihads.



Angela Merkel, who did not reject Cameron's remarks out of hand, has no interest

in Britain being forced out of the EU by a failed negotiation. It would leave

Germany's increasingly assertive leadership more exposed, and impose strains on

weaker states who fear German dominance. If there is one alliance in Europe that

makes sense, it has always been Britain and Germany.



Cameron has bought himself five years before he has to seek a plebiscite on

whatever EU deal is achieved. The concept of referendum on such a matter is now

embedded in British constitutional practice. Five years is hardly a rush.



Nor will the question really be in or out, rather yes or no to a specific deal -

with, if no, a further negotiation. Cameron's message is clear. In a peroration

of pro-European sentiment, he declared his eagerness for a deal he can recommend

to voters, which they will likely accept. This is hardly a grim confrontation.



This continent is now a mess. Yesterday's news that Spanish unemployment has

topped 25% - with the eurozone silent in response - is appalling. So are similar

prospects facing the overvalued currencies of Greece, France and Italy. This

predicament is not an act of God. It is the fault of the political institutions

of the European political collective. Indeed, Cameron could be accused of

extreme tact in his analysis.



Every tribe has its scapegoats for such failure. Mine are the political and

intellectual elites that uncritically flattered the Brussels powerbrokers for

half a century. These brokers were given untrammelled power, less to do with

free trade than with the interest groups and lobbyists that are now also

corrupting and immobilising federal Washington.



The past is water under the bridge. For Britain to "leave Europe" is most

unlikely, though only the blinkered could call it catastrophic. Life, and trade,

would go on. American, Chinese and Japanese goods are not absent from Europe's

shelves because they are not in the EU, nor vice versa. There would be a crisis,

but crisis is the only time the EU shakes itself to life.



Britain and the other peoples of Europe should benefit from sharing one economic

space, a single and competitive market place. That does not yet exist: as Gandhi

said of British civilisation, "that would be a good thing". The EU's elder

statesmen tried to run politically before they could walk economically. They

have ended flat on their faces and seem unable to move.



In recent surveys median approval for the EU has never risen above 60% in its

big countries. This is an ailing political institution. Most of their embattled

leaders have buried their heads in the sand. Cameron has had a terrible year and

could have done likewise. Instead he has come up for air and told Europe's

emperors it is time they got dressed.

Front: Osborne defies IMF over pace of cuts plan



BYLINE: Heather Stewart, Davos, Patrick Wintour



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 651 words





George Osborne insists he will press ahead with the government's austerity plans

despite a warning from the International Monetary Fund yesterday that the

chancellor should slow the pace of cuts.



On the eve of the latest GDP growth figures for the UK economy, the chancellor

said the credibility Britain had built up by setting out a tough package of tax

rises and spending plans had been "hard won, and easily lost", adding that it

would be "a huge mistake to put that at risk".



The IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said the time had come for the

chancellor to act on the Fund's repeated warnings that if the economy remained

weak he should moderate his plans.



Blanchard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We said that if things look bad

at the beginning of 2013 - which they do - then there should be a reassessment

of fiscal policy. We still believe that. We've never been passionate about

austerity. From the beginning we have always emphasised that fiscal

consolidation should be slow and steady."



Osborne said he had already adjusted his plans to the weaker-than-expected

economy, when he used last month's autumn statement to announce that fiscal

consolidation will now extend until 2017-18. "It is credible, it is flexible,

and we have already exercised that flexibility," he said.



The Office for National Statistics will publish its first estimate of GDP growth

for the final quarter of 2012 today, amid forecasts that the economy has

declined by up to 0.5% and is on the brink of a triple-dip recession.



Seizing on Blanchard's remarks, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said: "David

Cameron and George Osborne must finally heed the IMF's advice. After two and a

half years of flatlining and a double-dip recession the IMF is now clearly

losing patience. The longer the government clings to its failing plan, the more

long-term damage they will do to our economy."



Nick Clegg conceded in an interview published yesterday that the coalition had

cut capital spending too quickly. "If I'm going to be sort of self-critical,

there was this reduction in capital spending when we came into the coalition

government. I think we comforted ourselves at the time that it was actually no

more than what Alistair Darling spelled out anyway, so in a sense everybody was

predicting a significant drop off in capital investment," the deputy prime

minister told House magazine. "But I think we've all realised that you actually

need, in order to foster a recovery, to try and mobilise as much public and

private capital into infrastructure as possible."



Previously Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has said that

even if he had known the economy was going to grow as slowly as it has, he would

have done the same.



"We have urged ministers to bring forward infrastructure investment and build

thousands more homes, but they have refused to listen," said Rachel Reeves, the

shadow chief secretary.



There was a brief outburst of excitement on City trading floors at lunchtime

yesterday as rumours circulated that the official GDP data had leaked out and

that some dealers were acting on data that would show the economy in better

health than economists are expecting. There was a sudden blip in the currency

markets, but the Office for National Statistics refused to comment.



Osborne, who would have already seen the data before he spoke in Davos, repeated

his familiar mantra that "we are walking a difficult road, but we are heading in

the right direction".



Speaking a day after David Cameron pledged to try to renegotiate Britain's

relationship with the EU, and then offer the public a referendum on EU

membership, Osborne backed the prime minister's stance. "Europe needs to change,

to meet the expectations of all its peoples, no matter what country they live

in," he said. "Europe has to become a competitive place, where companies can be

secure, jobs are created, and young people have careers."

Letter: Camerons chance to deal with long-term EU problems



BYLINE: Yugo Kovach



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 37



LENGTH: 196 words





* Timothy Garton Ash and his ilk call it the EU accord on the free movement of

peoples (From outside, it's clear Britain has to stay in Europe, 24 January).

For many others it's nothing less than mass immigration. The problem is a living

wage and mass immigration are mutually exclusive. Either curtail immigration, in

which case the market will automatically raise the minimum wage, or let the CBI

decide how many to let in.



Curtailing unskilled immigration from outside the EU will not be sufficient to

achieve a living wage. It will also require curtailing immigration from within

an ever-expanding EU. But an end to importing cheap labour has a "democratic"

downside. It will involve a transfer of purchasing power from the more numerous

and more likely to vote middle class to the less numerous and less likely to

vote working class, albeit tempered by a reduction in welfare costs.



Our mainstream political parties would probably find this electorally

unacceptable, although for anyone concerned about national cohesiveness it

should be a price worth paying. Everything else about the EU is "small print"

and not worthy of a referendum.

National: PM tells business: time to 'wake up and smell the coffee' over tax:

Cameron makes tackling avoidance a G8 priority: Depiction of profession is

unfair, say accountants



BYLINE: Larry Elliott and Heather Stewart Davos



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 808 words





David Cameron took a swipe at Starbucks last night as he promised that making

business pay its fair share would be one of three key aims of Britain's G8

presidency.



"Companies need to wake up and smell the coffee, because the customers who buy

from them have had enough," the prime minister told business leaders at the

World Economic Forum in Davos.



Protesters targeted Starbucks branches last year after it admitted it had paid

just £8.6m in UK corporation tax over the past 14 years. The firm subsequently

promised to pay £20m over two years.



Cameron's speech attracted strong criticism from the body that represents

Britain's accountants, but the PM insisted he was the most "pro-business leader"

one could find. He said it was not just NGOs that had been lobbying him to crack

down on tax-dodging firms, but the upper echelons of the City too. "It's a world

where some companies navigate around legitimate tax systems - and even low tax

rates - with an army of clever accountants."



There was nothing wrong with sensible tax planning, but "some forms of avoidance

have become so aggressive that I think it's time to call for more responsibility

and for governments to act accordingly".



He said: "In the UK we've already committed hundreds of millions into this

effort - but acting alone has its limits. Clamp down in one country and the

travelling caravan of lawyers, accountants and financial gurus just moves on

elsewhere. We need to act together at the G8."



John Christensen, of the Tax Justice Network, welcomed Cameron's stress on

beating tax avoidance but said: "It depends on the details. We need a complete

root and branch reform of how companies are taxed. How do you tax companies when

they live outside the nation state, in the ether, and can move their profits to

where they pay the least tax?"



Michael Izza, chief executive of the ICAEW, which represents accountants, and

was in the audience at Davos, said he was disappointed to hear the prime

minister "again dismiss accountants, this time as an 'army' of avoiders".



"We don't recognise that description. Our members do not support illegal tax

evasion or the kind of aggressive tax avoidance that we believe to be unethical.

In fact, an effective accountancy and finance profession can and does help solve

many of the problems the prime minister wants to address."



A Starbucks spokesperson said: "Starbucks agrees that all businesses should pay

their fair share. We employ 9,000 people in the UK, create nearly £300m worth of

annual economic impact and are forgoing tax deductions that will ensure the UK

exchequer is £10m better off in each of the next two years." The company last

night announced quarterly global profits of $432m (£274m). In a conference call

with analysts, Starbucks chief Howard Schultz and senior executives avoided

mentioning the prime minister's comments.



There were concerns from other business leaders last night that additional rules

over reporting tax could add to red tape for firms or make the UK less

competitive than other countries.



Cameron used his speech to lay out his agenda for the G8 summit, which will be

held in June. As well as tightening up the international tax system, the prime

minister said trade and transparency would be key priorities for Britain's G8

chairmanship. He attacked companies which indulge in corrupt business practices

in poor countries. Britain last occupied the G8 post in 2005, when Tony Blair

put aid, trade and debt relief high on the agenda.



Cameron said there was still unfinished business on trade and called for the

completion of a free trade deal between the EU and the US which he said could

add £50bn to Europe's economy.



Seeking to reassure business, he said: "I'm as pro-business a leader as you can

find." But he added: "I'm a low-tax Conservative, not a 'businesses should pay

no tax' Conservative."



He was proud that Britain was living up to its pledge to spend 0.7% of national

income on development assistance, but greater transparency was needed to make

sure the aid was well spent. "There's a long and tragic history of some African

countries being stripped of their minerals behind a veil of secrecy. We can see

the results: the government cronies get rich while the people stay poor."



Cameron said unleashing natural resources from developing countries for the

benefit of local people would dwarf anything aid could do - and transparency was

vital to that. "So we're going to push for more transparency on who owns

companies, on who's buying land and for what purpose, on how governments spend

their money, on how gas, oil and mining companies operate, on who is hiding

stolen assets and how we recover and return them."

National: Referendum pledge won't rule out new coalition, says Clegg: Lib Dems

could join Tories in government after 2015: Party opposes Cameron's plan for

vote on EU future



BYLINE: Juliette Jowit, Political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 16



LENGTH: 467 words





The Conservative policy of holding a referendum on staying in or quitting the

European Union would not necessarily prevent the Liberal Democrats forming

another coalition with them, Nick Clegg indicated last night. The Lib Dem

leader's acceptance of a referendum as part of a future governing deal could be

crucial to forming a coalition if neither the Conservatives nor Labour win an

outright majority at the next general election in 2015.



Clegg repeated his opposition to the proposal, outlined by Cameron on Wednesday,

that a future Tory government would renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU

and then hold a referendum.



A poll for theTimes this morning showed that if a referendum was held now, 40%

would vote in favour of leaving the EU, with 37% wanting to stay and 23%

undecided.



"I simply don't understand the point of spending years and years tying yourself

up in knots first, so-called 'renegotiating' the terms of Britain's membership

in ways that at the moment at least, are completely vague," Clegg said during

his weekly phone-in programme on LBC radio. "And I think that discourages

investment and inhibits growth in jobs."



However, when pressed on whether it would prevent the Lib Dems forming another

coalition with the Conservatives, Clegg appeared to suggest that ways could be

found to accept the referendum. Such a move has precedent in the last coalition

agreement, where Tories supported a holding a referendum on alternative voting,

but campaigned against the idea.



"I'll follow the instructions of the British people," said Clegg. "If a

coalition is necessary following the votes of the British people, then we'll

play our part."



Asked by LBC presenter Nick Ferrari to confirm that he was saying the Lib Dem

leader "could work with him (Cameron) in a coalition", Clegg added: "I will

always play a responsible role. I've done it in the past at some political cost

and I'll do it again if necessary to provide . . . good government in the

national interest."



Meanwhile, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, followed up her cautious

indication on Wednesday that she was open to a "fair compromise" by yesterday

describing Cameron as a "friend" and telling the World Economic Forum in Davos

that the eurozone's rules should be "binding" for themselves but "freely

accessible" to other EU countries such as the UK.



Billionaire George Soros also waded into the debate over a possible EU

referendum yesterday. Speaking over dinner at Davos, Soros said that Cameron was

responding to pressure from his own backbenchers with "a dangerous gambit which

could actually lead to Britain leaving (the EU)". He added that the UK is

currently in "the best of all possible positions," because it is a member of the

EU, without being part of the crisis-hit single currency.

World Economic Forum: Davos diary



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 25



LENGTH: 333 words





* If Mario Monti, below, does receive the order of the boot in next month's

Italian elections, he could try a late career change into stand-up. He told

Davos about how a Qatari royal had told him that "corruption" was the biggest

factor preventing Qatar from investing in Italy. "I was a bit shocked," Monti

dead-panned. "Partly because it wasn't the king of Norway talking." That's bound

to bring the Middle East petromoney pouring in.



* Two US visitors were grumbling they'd missed the opening sessions (including

Jamie Dimon bashing the banker-bashers) because they were too early in the day.

"They should just devote the morning to issues that are interesting to European

visitors," bemoaned one. Or Davos staff could leave alarm clocks instead of

complimentary chocolates in visitors' rooms. One of our party missed out on the

choccies, though, and found a sausage lovingly placed in their bedroom instead.



* Davos's pavements are notoriously slippery, but for some visitors the Congress

Centre is also a dangerous place. One woman narrowly missed scattering the

gaggle around Jamie Dimon like ninepins, after failing to spot a small step and

tumbling over. "Second time I've seen that this morning," whispered one British

hack. We'll set a video camera up tomorrow.



* Russia's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, wasn't shaken by the news that

almost 78% of people in the Davos Hall felt "better governance" was the top

priority for the Federation. "I knew most people at Davos would vote that way,"

he said. "I voted for another option." So, it would have been a bigger landslide

if Medvedev had gracefully abstained.



* Davos was spared any serious snow showers on the opening day of the World

Economic Forum'. Instead, it was David Cameron's long-awaited speech on an EU

referendum that slightly rained on the parade. Few British CEOs avoided being

quizzed about it - while one US banker waved the query away as he had enough on

his plate without "taking on the UK government's challenges as well".

Comment: Cameron was not brave yesterday. He was reckless: This marks the moment

when his pragmatic centre-right project finally bent the knee to ideological

fantasy



BYLINE: Martin Kettle



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 28



LENGTH: 913 words





As David Cameron entered the Commons at the end of a morning that began with his

speech on Europe, his backbenchers did something they rarely do these days. They

cheered him to the echo. Moments earlier the Conservative chairman, Grant

Shapps, had announced on TV that the Europe speech had united the party. The

sight of so many delighted Tory MPs, many of whom have become minor political

celebrities by making the prime minister's life miserable, seemed to suggest

Shapps was right.



Looked at more carefully, however, it was a sight that brought to mind the

famous words of Sir Robert Walpole, declaring war on Spain in 1739: "They now

ring the bells, but they will soon wring their hands." Or a scene that recalled

something Tony Blair was fond of saying in the more recent past: "The British

people may have their prejudices, but they get very uneasy when their

politicians start to share them."



Be in no doubt. Cameron will enjoy a turbocharged good press. His poll numbers

will move up too. Much of the praise will be misdirected, however. This was an

important speech about an important subject. The tone, especially in the parts

dealing with the European Union's successes and failures, was practical and

thoughtful. But the promise of an in-out referendum, far from being an act of

political mastery, could prove to be Cameron's career-defining error.



The first reason is the bad timing. Why do this now? There is no imminent

climactic decision facing the EU. The terms of the post-eurozone crisis EU have

yet to be set. There is an act of the UK parliament guaranteeing a yes-no vote

on any large treaty change. And Cameron does not know the outcome of the 2015

election: he may lead a Tory majority government after 2015, but he may face

another coalition. Cameron has made a rod for his own back because of a misread

threat from Ukip.



Yesterday's pledge does not settle the European issue in the Tory party either.

On the contrary. Everything is still to play for in the EU. Cameron has not said

what his red lines are. He does not give details because he doesn't know the

answer. Nor does he know what is negotiable and what is not. And he cannot

answer the question that Labour's Douglas Alexander rightly keeps asking: what

proportion of what you want would qualify as a victory that justified a yes - is

it 50%, 70%, 90% or even 100%?



The referendum is five years away - a very long time. The coming vote will now

infect everything Cameron does. He may present an appearance of indifference to

the outcome - sure, stay in if we can, but hey, leave if we must. But his

preference was clear. He wants Britain to stay in "heart and soul". These are

strong words. I assume he meant them. But they mean he cannot afford to lose. So

every large decision must now be judged according to whether it advances his

chances of victory in 2018. Europe, meanwhile, knows it can play a tight game.

Cameron has bought himself five years of battles. And for what in return?



The second great reason for scepticism about Cameron's strategy is the

likelihood of its destructive impact on the Conservative party. Think ahead to

the four possible outcomes of the referendum he has now announced. None is

without serious peril. If Cameron wins a stay-in vote in 2018, it will be a

personal triumph. But a substantial rump of Tory diehard anti-Europeans will be

devastated. They want the referendum because they want to leave the EU. They

will never vote to stay. They also despise Cameron. After an in vote they will

no longer have a political raison d'etre. They could split the party to the

right, and perhaps join Ukip, or worse.



But what if Cameron campaigns to stay in and loses? That would mean the end of

his career, the probable fall of the government and the likelihood of party

civil war. There would be no love lost between the Tories' in and out factions

on the day after Cameron lost the referendum. A split would again be likely, and

even under Boris Johnson the Conservatives' chances of winning a new general

election would be fragile.



Alternatively, what if an angry Cameron returns empty-handed from Berlin and

finds himself leading an out campaign to victory in the promised referendum? At

least some moderate Tories would be likely to defect to the centre immediately.

But this ultimate Eurosceptic triumph would quickly turn sour on the Tories.

Without Europe, they would have no one else to blame. The voters would soon get

buyer's remorse. Labour would immediately prosper. Electoral defeat and the

political wilderness would beckon for the Tories.



Now suppose, finally, that Cameron leads a get out campaign but is defeated. The

voters decide instead to stay in the EU against the advice of most of his party.

The government could not survive - and Labour might then be looking at a

1997-style landslide in the unavoidable ensuing election.



Cameron's speech was not brave. It was reckless. The brave stance yesterday was

Ed Miliband's, sticking to Labour's practical pro-Europeanism and refusing to

follow suit. Instead, yesterday marks the moment when Cameron's pragmatic

centre-right political project finally bent the knee to the ideological fantasy

about Europe that still grips the Tory party. It was a step back towards a past

from which Cameron once promised to lead his party. It was a step away from the

electoral middle ground of which he has always seemed a natural inhabitant. It

is a big moment and, in its way, even a tragic one.

Comment: From outside, it's clear why Britain has to stay in Europe: Cameron's

speech could have been a lot worse, but five years of anxious uncertainty are

bad news for Europe and the world



BYLINE: Timothy Garton Ash in Mumbai



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 29



LENGTH: 1078 words





So now we know: Europe will be roiled by internal turmoil for another five

years. While Germany, France and others wrestle to build a stronger core Europe

around the eurozone, David Cameron's Conservatives, if elected in 2015, will try

to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership in the whole EU club and then

put that "new settlement" to the British people in an "in or out" referendum by

the end of 2017.



World, you have been warned. Europe as an economic giant? Yes, still. Europe as

a strong force in a new multipolar world? Postponed to the Greek calends - and

now to the British ones as well. Whether you are watching from India, China,

Russia, America or Brazil, you can forget that prospect for the foreseeable

future. In fact, most people in those countries already have.



But first, what of the speech itself? Well, it could have been a lot worse. As a

pro-European who has argued that Britain should hold an "in or out" referendum

in the next parliament, once the shape of eurozone-Europe and the results of any

attempted renegotiation of the terms of Britain's membership are known, I can

hardly complain if the British prime minister plumps for exactly that. While

much of the phrasing was patently crafted to please Eurosceptics, some of his

criticisms of today's EU are also justified.



Above all, the peroration of the speech was as clear, eloquent and forceful an

argument for Britain staying in the EU, on clearsighted, hard-nosed

Palmerstonian grounds of national interest, as you could hope to hear from a

leader of today's Conservative party. Those last minutes, between about 8.35am

and 8.45am London time, confirmed me in a view that I have taken against nervous

British pro-Europeans for some time: when it comes to the point, the British

people will vote to stay in the EU.



Yet they also confirmed the futility of this entire strategy. For those basic

arguments of national interest for Britain to stay in the EU will remain true,

however paltry the results of any formal renegotiation after 2015. In fact,

since Europe is a permanent negotiation, Britain would get a better deal if it

remained fully involved and committed all the time.



If other EU member states agree on nothing else, they agree on this: Britain

should not be given any major new exceptions from the rules of the whole club.

Now they will concede even less. If EU politics were a game of bridge, Cameron

has just effectively thrown away his strongest ace: the credible threat of

Britain leaving. Germany and other free-market north Europeans would not really

want to be left alone with the southerners. Even France would be ambivalent,

since Britain is the only other European country with a serious tradition of

projecting hard power - as most recently in Libya.



It's also bad for Europe. Some of the good reforms Cameron is preaching at

continental Europeans are now even less likely to happen since, whatever he

says, our partners all feel that he is batting for Britain not for Europe. In a

rare and revealing stumble by this otherwise accomplished speaker, when he was

arguing for his preferred option of a new reform treaty for the whole of the EU,

he said: "But if there is no appetite for a new treaty for us (pause, stumble) .

. . for us all." Freudian slip or Thatcherite one: that's what most continental

Europeans think he subconsciously means.



And yet, even though it would have been better for Europe to carry on without

this added diversion to the core problems of the whole project, a referendum

would have come sooner or later anyway. With the stakes raised like this, it

will be hard for other parties to refuse the British people a direct choice. As

a nice Polish phrase has it: we have to swallow this frog.



Meanwhile, the world will yawn its way through five more years of euroshemozzle.

And it will deal with Europe as it finds it: economic giant, political

hydra-head.



Like Reading Lolita in Tehran, watching Cameron in Mumbai has been a surreal

experience. Here I am, surrounded by the afterlife of British colonialism at its

most grandiloquent - the monumental Gateway to India, built in Bombay harbour to

celebrate the visit of the King-Emperor George V in 1911, colonial-style

tearooms fluttering with now Indian talk of "tiffin" and "chaps". And there, on

the television screen, a hundred years later, is a vaguely viceregal British

prime minister who nonetheless feels it necessary to explain, to what was once

the party of empire, why Britain really should not opt to be an offshore

Switzerland, a Norway without the oil or the Greater Cayman Islands.



And the Indians, those at the top of the pile who are now prosperous and

sophisticated representatives of one of the 21st-century's great emerging

powers, how do they view this distant political gymkhana? Mainly not at all.

Indian acquaintances confirm my impression that the speech did not make the news

bulletins of the main local channels. Indians have their own politics to worry

about, and their own problems: India's poverty makes hard-hit Greece look like

paradise. But beyond that, they view Britain's agonising about its place in the

world with mixed feelings.



One hears of a liking for London as a place to live and do business; of

admiration for UK universities (if only the Cameron government's misbegotten

student visa squeeze does not prevent their children studying there); of some

attachment to British traditions of literature, good government and common law

(a shipping merchant here tells me he makes contracts with Chinese partners

under English law).



But there is absolutely no echo of the neo-Tory idea that a strategic special

relationship between Britain and India, Britain and the whole Commonwealth,

could be any substitute for Britain's place in Europe, and India's relationship

with Europe as a whole. India, like Britain, will pursue its own national

interest, starting in its own neighbourhood. If Cameron doesn't know that

already, he will hear it again on his planned second official visit to India

next month.



Ultimately the point is this. History has dealt Britain an amazing hand. Though

a shadow of its former imperial self, the country has unique ties to Europe, to

the United States, to the rest of the English-speaking world, and to quite a few

other places (for instance, in Latin America) as well: spades, hearts, diamonds

and clubs. Who but an idiot would throw away one of his (or her) strongest

suits? And we Brits are not idiots, are we? Are we?

Front: Let's talk, says Merkel, as Cameron gambles on EU: Berlin hints at

compromise amid French disdain: Tory delight, but warning from business leaders



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt, Ian Traynor and Patrick Wintour



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 856 words





Angela Merkel created a small breathing space for David Cameron yesterday when

she gave a guarded response to his landmark speech on Europe, paving the way for

the prime minister to campaign in favour of an in-out referendum on Britain's

membership of the EU at the next election.



As most European leaders rejected Cameron's demands for a radical overhaul of

the terms of Britain's EU membership, the German chancellor indicated she was

open to negotiating a "fair compromise".



The intervention by Merkel, hours after the prime minister called for Britain to

be exempted from the EU's founding objective to create "an ever-closer union",

delighted Downing Street which had worked hard to brief on Cameron's speech.



He outlined the scale of his ambition to transform the terms of Britain's

membership of the EU when he cast himself as a modern-day heretic ready to

challenge the defining declaration of the 1957 treaty of Rome which founded the

EEC.



"We understand and respect the right of others to maintain their commitment to

this goal," he said of the commitment to forge an ever-closer union. "But for

Britain - and perhaps for others - it is not the objective. And we would be much

more comfortable if the treaty specifically said so, freeing those who want to

go further, faster, to do so, without being held back by the others."



Cameron did not set out his specific negotiating objectives but said "nothing

was off the table" as he set out a vision of a flexible Europe unlikely to find

many friends in Europe. He made clear he wanted repeal of the current working

hours directive, a clawing back of EU powers in fields of environment, social

affairs and crime, fewer EU commissioners and protection of UK rights in the

single market as the eurozone members strengthen their co-operation.



His demands will be tabled in negotiations if he wins the 2015 general election.

A new settlement would then be put to voters in a referendum by the end of 2017.



"I believe in confronting this issue - shaping it, leading the debate," he told

an audience at the London headquarters of Bloomberg. "Not simply hoping a

difficult situation will go away."



The speech delighted Tory MPs across the party, on a temporary basis at least,

and prompted Ed Miliband to harden his position when he rejected an in-out

referendum on the terms proposed by Cameron, riling some of his frontbench team.

But Tony Blair led an immediate fightback by pro-Europeans when he likened the

speech to the scene in the Mel Brooks film Blazing Saddles where the sheriff

points a gun at his own head.



Merkel gave a guarded response in which she was careful not to reject Cameron's

demands out of hand. "Germany, and I personally, want Britain to be an important

part and an active member of the European Union," she said. "We are prepared to

talk about British wishes but we must always bear in mind that other countries

have different wishes and we must find a fair compromise."



German officials made clear Merkel's words were chosen to ensure Berlin would

not block Cameron from placing a referendum commitment in the 2015 Tory

manifesto. But Berlin remains sceptical of the Tories' tactics and is likely to

fight any British attempt to gain a competitive advantage in the single market.



EU diplomats and officials said Merkel, who is keen to keep Britain in the EU,

would drive the hardest of bargains amid acute concern that Cameron had plunged

the EU into years of uncertainty when the paramount priority for the others is

to recover from the euro crisis.



Other EU leaders lined up to declare there would be no "cherry-picking", nor "a

la carte" terms tailored to suit the British. Cameron's only whole-hearted

backing came from the prime minister of the Czech Republic while his allies, the

prime ministers of Sweden and the Netherlands, sat on the fence.



The French president, Francois Hollande, told his cabinet in Paris that being an

EU member "brought obligations", according to an Elysee Palace spokeswoman. The

French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said: "You can't do Europe a la carte,"

adding mischievously that Paris would roll out the red carpet to fleeing UK

businesses if Britain quit the EU. "I'll take an example which our British

friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join.

Once you're in it you can't say: 'Let's play rugby'."



Cameron, who was greeted by ecstatic Tory MPs waving their order papers as he

arrived for prime minister's questions, won overwhelming support from the 1922

committee last night.



But senior figures warned that the unity could break down if France and Germany

press ahead with plans to create new governance arrangements for the eurozone

before the 2015 general election. Cameron is banking on a delay in any major

revision of the Lisbon treaty until after the election after Nick Clegg

dismissed his strategy yesterday. One senior Tory warned that up to 20% of the

party will campaign for a no vote if the prime minister achieves only "token"

concessions in any negotiation.

Europe: Blazing Blair



BYLINE: Andrew Pulver



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 162 words





Tony Blair lambasted David Cameron's plan for an in-out referendum on Britain's

EU membership, warning metaphorically that the prime minister could end up

blowing out his brains by threatening to leave.



Blair told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: "It reminds me a bit of the Mel

Brooks comedy Blazing Saddles where the sheriff says at one point as he holds a

gun to his own head: 'If you don't do what I want I'll blow my brains out.' You

want to watch out that one of the 26 (other EU member states) doesn't just say:

'OK, go ahead.'"



He was most probably referring to a scene in the film where the sheriff (played

by Cleavon Little, above) does point a gun to his own head and threaten himself,

but it is in fact a brilliantly funny manoeuvre to allow him to escape from a

racist lynch mob. So if Blair is comparing Cameron to Little, what he is

actually suggesting is, as Little says to himself at the end of the scene: "Ooh,

baby, you are so talented! And they are so dumb!"

Europe: One speech, many audiences: Nicholas Watt analyses six key extracts that

show how David Cameron shaped his speech to appeal to different constituencies



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 653 words





"I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue - shaping

it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away."



Aimed at mainstream Eurosceptics



such as Andrea Leadsom MP (pictured)



David Cameron took a giant step in mending fences with a large number of

Conservative MPs who were upset when he imposed a three-line whip in October

2011 opposing a referendum on Britain's EU membership. A total of 81 Tory MPs

rebelled. Mark Pritchard, one of the rebel ringleaders, welcomed the speech when

he tweeted: "Congratulation to the prime minister on becoming the 82nd Tory

rebel. We're all in this together!"



"I understand the impatience of wanting to make that choice (on continued

membership) immediately. But I don't believe that to make a decision at this

moment is the right way forward, either for Britain or for Europe as a whole. A

vote today between the status quo and leaving would be an entirely false

choice."



Aimed at hardline Eurosceptics



There is such mistruct between Downing Street and some hardline Eurosceptics

that No 10 was bracing itself for criticism for its plan to delay the referendum

for five years. The Tory MEP Dan Hannan (right), who wants Britain to leave the

EU and who has led calls for a referendum, was delighted. But the MP John Baron,

who persuaded 100 colleagues to sign a letter last year calling for a referendum

, said the prime minister should legislate for the referendum now.



"If we don't address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and

the British people will drift towards the exit. I do not want that to happen. I

want the European Union to be a success. And I want a relationship between

Britain and the EU that keeps us in it."



Aimed at pro-Europeans



The prime minister believes he is doing pro-Europeans a favour by addressing

"public disillusionment" with the EU in a way that could stabilise Britain's

position in the EU. He believes that a major repatriation of powers would

address the democratic consent for the EU which he described as "wafer thin".

Kenneth Clarke, who told the FT recently that referendums are usually proposed

by "hangers and floggers", will give his response next week.



"I say to our European partners, frustrated as some of them no doubt are by

Britain's attitude: work with us on this . . . Just as I believe that Britain

should want to remain in the EU so the EU should want us to stay"



Aimed at European leaders



He made a point of briefing Angela Merkel and other EU leaders on his speech. He

wants to make clear to Britain's 26 EU partners that his plan to repatriate

powers, to be endorsed in a referendum, is not a hostile act. A successful

negotiation would lead to a great prize: settled British membership of the EU.



"We would have to think carefully too about the impact on our influence at the

top table of international affairs. There is no doubt that we are more powerful

in Washington, in Beijing, in Delhi because we are a powerful player in the

European Union"



Aimed at Barack Obama



Cameron knows that the US believes Britain should remain an influential member

of the EU because Washington believes European integration is the best way of

ensuring stability on the continent that has caused it such grief. US interests

also lie in ensuring that such a staunch ally can influence the EU.



"We should also remember how the shift in Europe from war to sustained peace

came about. It did not happen like a change in the weather. It happened because

of determined work over generations."



Aimed at praising the EU's founding fathers



The prime minister began his speech as Margaret Thatcher ended her landmark

Bruges speech in 1988 - praising the architects of European co-operation. Unlike

Thatcher, who named the "remarkable" late Belgian prime minister Paul Henri

Spaak, who chaired the committee that led to the eventual formation of the EEC,

Cameron did not name any of the fathers of the EU.

Europe: World reaction: US and China unease over Britain's stance



BYLINE: Ewen MacAskill in Washington, Jonathan Kaiman in Beijing and Jason Burke

in Delhi



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 558 words





The Obama administration is making no attempt to hide its dismay over David

Cameron's speech and the prospect of the UK exiting the European Union, a move

which Washington views as undermining prospects for a united military and

foreign policy.



The White House reiterated its belief yesterday that Britain is stronger within

Europe but ducked the fresh opportunity to lean on Downing Street over the

issue, favouring more conciliatory language than in recent weeks.



"We welcome the prime minister's call for Britain to remain in Europe," said

spokesman Jay Carney. "We believe that the UK is stronger as a result of its EU

membership and as a result of having the UK in, the EU is stronger."



But asked about prospects of a referendum on EU membership, Carney would only

say: "The internal processes by which these matters are discussed are a matter

for local governments."



In contrast with a decade ago, when the Bush administration appeared to welcome

division in Europe, the Obama administration values a united Europe, not least

in sharing the military burden of being the world's policeman.



When Obama became president in 2009, leading members of his foreign and security

team proposed retilting the balance away from Europe, with the cold war

mentality of fear of Russia largely redundant, to the Pacific, to face the

challenge from China. Obama reiterated in the run-up to re-election in November

last year that a focus on the Pacific remained one of his priorities.



But his position on Europe has softened over the last four years, seeing a value

in an alliance that saw European engagement in various troublespots, primarily

France and Britain taking a lead in Libya.



Although the Obama administration pays lip-service to the "special

relationship", it has forged closer ties with Germany, to the chagrin of

Britain.



Matthias Matthijs, Washington-based assistant professor and European specialist

at the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University,

said: "I think the Americans are greatly frustrated with all this UK fickleness

on Europe."



There was no official response from the Chinese government yesterday, but

experts there said the spectre of a 2017 in-out referendum could damage Sino-UK

economic relations and unsettle Chinese business leaders who have come to rely

on Britain as a key player in Sino-EU trade.



The EU is China's largest trading partner - the two economies trade over £840m

per day - and as such, China's regional economic allegiances are clear. "If the

UK really exits the European Union, this will create some uncertainties for

Chinese business leaders," said Gary Liu, a professor at the China Europe

International Business School in Shanghai. Withdrawal, he added, could "create

actual cost for Chinese people to do business in Europe."



Chinese foreign policy officials would perceive a split between the UK and the

EU as a possible harbinger of closer ties between UK and the US - not a

China-friendly development, given a recent surge of distrust in Sino-US affairs.

"We all know that Great Britain is a special ally of the United States, and

Great Britain is also a very important country in the European Union," said Shi

Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.

"But if you abandon (the latter) identity, you will only have one identity in

Chinese eyes."

Europe: Labour refuses to be swayed by Cameron's rush to referendum: Ed Miliband

has taken a risk - and disappointed members of the shadow cabinet - by not

capitalising on the new Eurosceptic mood. But he may reap benefits in the

future, writes Patrick Wintour

Ed Miliband yesterday risked alienating some voters, and unnerving sections of

his own shadow cabinet, when he stood firm, saying he was opposed to an in-out

referendum on the terms proposed by David Cameron.



The Tories seized on his statement, claiming he was against an in-out referendum

, but Miliband's aides said the party only opposed a referendum now.



However, the Conservatives were confident that the Labour leader had made a

disastrous political error for which he would pay a price at the next election.

Grant Shapps, the Conservative chairman, said: "It's clear that Labour doesn't

trust the British public to have their say on their country's future."



But those senior members of the shadow cabinet that would have preferred a

clearer pro-referendum line bit their lips, saying the option remained open.

Others claimed Cameron would enjoy a short-term hit, but that the speech would

not age well. Some senior backbenchers such as Keith Vaz, the home affairs

select committee chairman and a former Europe minister, openly called for a

referendum, but surprisingly few Labour voices called for Miliband to follow

Cameron.



Those most sympathetic to a referendum forced a shadow cabinet discussion a

fortnight ago to tilt the party's European policy - to make it clearer that

Labour would keep its options open on a referendum, and not appear to be

advocates of a status quo in Europe. That view was reflected in Miliband's

recent broadcast interviews and the definitive speech to Chatham House delivered

by the shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander.



Among those pushing this stance were shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, and the head

of the party's policy review, Jon Cruddas, an unabashed advocate of a referendum

.



Although there are different attitudes to Europe inside the Labour leadership,

there is little of the visceral hatred found in the Conservative party and the

debate is as much about political tactics as anything. One source said: "It

depends how important Europe becomes in the election. As Lord Ashcroft's polling

shows, it is not that important with most voters, but if the issue of whether a

party is holding a referendum or not becomes important, then that becomes a

problem for us."



Since the shadow cabinet discussion, Miliband has emphasised that Labour has

supported the legal lock passed in the 2011 European Union Act that requires a

referendum if there is a transfer of powers from Westminster to Brussels.



Lawyers dispute precisely when that referendum might be triggered by the act,

but it is agreed an increase in majority voting at EU level, so reducing

national sovereignty, would require a referendum.



If Miliband found himself in a serious political hole on the need to offer a

referendum, it would be possible for him - in 12 to 18 months' time - to say

events in Europe show there will be a transfer of sovereignty and so a

referendum is required. Miliband would be seen to be awkwardly following the

lead of Cameron, but that is not politically disastrous.



The current position has allowed most of the big pro-European voices - Miliband,

Alexander, Balls, Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson - to unite around the argument

that it is damaging to the British economic interest to put a five-year question

mark over membership of the single market.



Blair said yesterday: "I think it's a huge worry in circumstances where you put

on the agenda the prospect of Britain leaving. Why would we do that? We don't

yet know what we are proposing or what we can get negotiated. We don't yet know

what the rest of Europe is going to propose. I don't believe in a referendum

unless it's necessary to do it. This referendum will happen in four or five

years' time."



He said that, as a tactic, "it reminds me a bit of the Mel Brooks comedy Blazing

Saddles where the sheriff says at one point during it - holds a gun to his own

head and says, 'If you don't do what I want, I'll blow my brains out'. You know,

you want to watch that one of the 26 (other EU states) don't just say, 'Well OK,

go ahead.'"



Alexander questioned Cameron's timing and motive, pointing out: "There are no

changes being considered in the eurozone that impact on British sovereignty and,

if there are any changes that lead to a transfer of power from Britain to

Brussels, then according to the law we already have on the statute book that

would automatically trigger a referendum."



He said he supported changes to the EU but added: "The idea that you put a gun

to the head of your EU partners and stand in the departure lounge shouting at 26

other members of European Union as the way to get those changes does not make

sense to me".



Mandelson, who is one of many pointing out Europe can help to restore Labour's

relationship with business, said Cameron's speech was "about pleasing a party

audience and the people who he used to call the fruitcakes and headbangers".



Miliband's stance has the additional benefit of being almost identical to that

of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, so giving both parties some mutual political

cover.



Clegg said: "The priority of the Liberal Democrats is to build a stronger

economy in a fairer society. Now, that job is made all the harder if we have

years of grinding uncertainty because of an ill-defined, protracted

renegotiation of Britain's status within the European Union.



"My priority remains, and will always remain: yes, reform in Europe; yes, a

referendum where the circumstances are right, as we've set out in law; but,

above and beyond anything else, promoting growth and jobs."



The similarity of the two leaders' stances is not lost on those that look

forward to the prospect of another hung parliament. If the voters give him a

genuine choice of parties in 2015, is Clegg more likely to join forces with

Cameron, with his ambitious plan to negotiate European optouts until November

2017, or Miliband?

Europe: Business reaction: 'We never like uncertainty,' company leaders warn PM



BYLINE: Larry Elliott in Davos



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 519 words





Britain's business leaders sympathise with the political pressures on David

Cameron over Europe but warned the prime minister yesterday that he needed to

tackle the uncertainty caused by the promise of an in-out referendum in 2017.



Executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos responded cautiously to

Cameron's long-awaited speech, expressing concerns - but not widespread alarm.



Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the multinational advertising company

WPP, was among the most anxious, identifying the possibility of Britain leaving

the European Union as one of the five major threats to the global economy as it

struggles to emerge from financial crisis, recession and a half-decade of weak

growth.



Sorrell said there were a number of "black and grey swans" - hidden or

half-hidden risks - that could derail an already tentative recovery. He warned

that the promise of a referendum in 2017 would make businesses less likely to

invest.



"A referendum adds to uncertainty - it doesn't diminish uncertainty," Sorrell

said. "I understand the PM's predicament. But a referendum creates more

uncertainty and we don't need that. This is a political decision, not an

economic decision. If I am looking at it from WPP, it isn't good news."



Sorrell fears Britain could "say no and move out at precisely the wrong time",

when the tough measures being taken by the eurozone are bearing fruit.



Peter Sands, chief executive of Standard Chartered bank, told Bloomberg TV: "My

feeling is that the UK needs to remain part of the EU. I completely understand

why prime minister Cameron thought it necessary to offer the people a referendum

. Europe is changing, and as the biggest country in Europe outside the eurozone,

the UK's relationship with the eurozone is going to change."



He added: "The European Union has been a massively important creation within

Europe. It is very good for the UK to be part of it. It will evolve. We have

seen that already in the eurozone. It is changing quite markedly. It is not a

bad thing to have the evolution, debates and questions."



However, Ian Cheshire, chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns DIY chain B&Q

and its equivalent in France, Castorama, said he supported the idea of a

referendum that he hoped would "put this to bed".



"It is a good step forward. The prime minister is trying to shape the agenda

rather than things happening as a result of drift and by default," he said.



Cheshire was one of 55 business figures who signed a letter to the Times

welcoming Cameron's move as "a European policy that will be good for business

and good for good jobs in Britain."



The CBI, mindful of the fact that its membership has widely different views

about Europe, is adopting a cautious approach to Cameron's speech.



Sir Roger Carr, the president of the CBI, said: "The tone, the style and the

emphasis of the speech, which was positive about European membership, was good

news.



"But the referendum builds in a degree of uncertainty and business never

welcomes uncertainty."

Europe: Travellers' views: 'It would be a shame if Britain left the EU'



BYLINE: James Meikle and Hasna Haider



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 8



LENGTH: 511 words





EU citizens leaving London on Eurostar only faced weather delays of up to 20

minutes on their journeys home yesterday - not a four-year wait for a referendum

.



That might explain the sympathetic response some travellers expressed towards

the UK government's position, although Michele Gentelet, from Paris, heading

home with three grandchildren, was blunt.



"Mr Cameron is not right. He takes things he wants in Europe but refuses what he

doesn't", said the 68-year-old cultural consultant at the Pompidou Centre. "In

Europe, he thinks, every country is below Britain. He talks Europe and acts only

in the interests of Great Britain."



Samuel Cohen, a film sound mixer living in the French capital was more

understanding of Britain's stance. "I think if there is a referendum and people

say what they want, it is a good attitude. There are people in France who don't

know where Europe is going. We don't even know where we are going with the

socialist government because a lot of people are running away from France,

particularly those with money. I am sure if there was a referendum in France

now, no (to EU membership) would win."



Cohen, 54, returning to Paris with his wife, Jacqueline, maintained French

people had already shown they had not "wanted Europe" in a referendum held by

President Jacques Chirac on the European constitution in 2005. It was adopted by

his successor Nicolas Sarkozy by signing the Lisbon treaty. "All the politicians

were saying support it, pushing people, which is normal."



Heading home for Lille, teacher Tania Carpenter, 35, said: "It would be a shame

(if Britain left). The British have always been pretty much apart but Europe

without Britain wouldn't seem like Europe any more. The question is will other

countries leave if Britain leaves?"



Countries went "for the whole package" of give and take with other members, she

added. "I don't think the French have been quite as picky as the British but

then you have your own currency so you are not a full part of Europe."



Falco Mooren, 39, a maintenance manager on Dutch railways from Utrecht, said

Britain did not always seem very co-operative. "I think people realise we may

get to the stage where we get a Europe of two speeds."



In the Netherlands, he believed, "only a very small minority" would want to

leave the EU, "but it is fully open for debate whether the structure we have is

right or not. It is not a question of in or out. I think people understand the

perspective of British people. There are serious questions as to whether Europe

is working. But with the English, the debate is not seen as very constructive.

It becomes a threat to leave rather than a debate on making things work better."



The Belgians at St Pancras seemed more interested in talking about the failings

of their own government which took nearly 500 days to form last year. "Sometimes

I think it is better for Belgium to leave the EU as well," said student Roseline

Suy, 19, from Antwerp.

Europe: Tories back PM's move - but there may be trouble ahead: Conservative MPs

rally behind pledge on EU Issue could split party and dominate 2015 elections



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 8



LENGTH: 782 words





David Cameron won overwhelming support last night from the Conservative 1922

backbench committee when MPs from across the party rallied behind his pledge to

hold an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017.



Tory pro-Europeans, Eurosceptics and opponents of the EU praised Cameron for

spelling out in clear terms the exact timing of the referendum in 2017 and the

form it will take - a straightforward in-out choice.



Bernard Jenkin, the veteran Eurosceptic, told the Guardian: "This is a very

significant moment. The commitment to the referendum is historic. There are

unanswered questions but nothing should dwarf the significance of this. The

speech sets out some very important principles about the importance of national

parliaments, the importance of legitimacy and the repudiation of ever closer

union is very significant."



Behind the shows of unity, however, senior Conservatives issued a series of

warnings to Downing Street last night about the pitfalls for Cameron over the

next five years.



Ian Birrell, his former speechwriter, described the speech in a blog on the

ConservativeHome website as "padding wrapped around a stick of political

dynamite". Writing of Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum, Birrell

said: "Mr Cameron has been forced to concede possibly the biggest gamble of his

prime ministerial career. This is not throwing a slab of red meat to the right -

it is giving them the keys to the abattoir."



Senior Eurosceptics illustrated Birrell's point by signalling when they made

clear that the party would split, with up to 20% of its MPs campaigning for a no

vote in the referendum, if the prime minister wins only "token" concessions in a

renegotiation of Britain's membership terms.



One Tory said: "If the prime minister does a token renegotiation and comes back

and says: 'Well I've got hospital doctors off the hook' and it is a great game

set and match - a John Major situation with Maastricht - most of the

Conservative party would go awol. The Conservative party is happy that we are

getting a vote but it is not focusing on what the substance of the position will

be."



One prominent pro-European took a different view as he hailed the speech as a

sign of the prime minister's commitment to the EU. Robert Buckland tweeted: "A

clear and passionate commitment to continued EU membership from @David-Cameron.

Britain has a vital role to play in Europe."



Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory deputy chairman, warned that the party could

actually diminish its chances of winning the 2015 general election if it allows

Europe to dominate its campaign. Ashcroft wrote on the ConservativeHome website:

"Tories must remember that we can only get what we want once we win an election.

The more we talk about changing our relationship with Europe, the less likely it

is to happen."



The prime minister is aware that the path towards the referendum will not be

easy. While he is an instinctive Eurosceptic he knows the dangers of allowing

the party to be defined by Europe after he was first elected to parliament in

the party's disastrous 2001 election which was dominated by William Hague's Keep

the Pound campaign. In his first party conference speech as leader in 2006,

Cameron famously said: "While parents worried about childcare, getting the kids

to school, balancing work and family life - we were banging on about Europe."



But Cameron left Downing Street for the World Economic Forum in Davos with two

clear thoughts. First, he believes Ed Miliband walked into a trap by rejecting

his in-out referendum, a position Labour compounded by suggesting that this was

not definitive. Second, he believes the party will be broadly united over Europe

in the run up, and through, the 2015 general election.



One senior Eurosceptic, who was consulted by Cameron as he finalised his speech,

said: "The prime minister ticked a series of boxes in his speech. No to ever

closer union - tick. Yes to a clear in-out referendum - tick. Yes to a return to

a common market - tick. And finally - how to be on the wrong side of history by

E. Miliband."



The breadth of opinion was reflected by one Tory who expects to campaign for a

no vote. "When I heard that the prime minister would say he will hold an in-out

referendum twice I thought fine - that's all we need."



Jenkin warned Britain would face a long haul in difficult negotiations. "It is

very significant that the prime minister has been explicit that (the referendum)

is in on the new terms or out. But there is a long way to go before we get to

that point. An awful lot of hypotheticals are being asked about what the

position of the party might be at that point which the prime minister would find

very difficult to answer."

Europe: Simon Hoggart's sketch: In, out, in, out? That's not really what it's

all about



BYLINE: Simon Hoggart



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 8



LENGTH: 655 words





David Cameron yesterday offered us the hokey-cokey referendum on the EU. It

would be "in, out, in, out, shake it all about". But the shake-it-all-about bit

will come first. He is going to tell the sclerotic, overpaid, misguided

functionaries of Brussels that there are too many sclerotic, overpaid, misguided

functionaries in Brussels. That'll shake 'em all about!



Mr Cameron announced this bid for British independence at Bloomberg, a huge US

financial news service. Its European operation is in a futuristic building in

London. Like all futuristic structures, it's beginning to look dated. Weird

lights and slogans run across the floors. There is a vast aquarium of colour

co-ordinated fish. In the atrium, 888 multi-coloured spheres light up as

employees log in to their computers. It's the modern equivalent of clocking on:

"Your sphere was late lighting up this morning, Perkins. Flu again, or another

of your hangovers?"



On giant screens around the building, Bloomberg TV pumped live coverage from the

World Economic Forum in Davos, so that the myrmidons could learn the opinions of

people who actually matter, unlike elected politicians.



But it was elected politicians to whom the prime minister was speaking. It

sounded - and he is good at this kind of reasonable,

gosh-who-could-possibly-disagree-with-that? speech - as if it were addressed to

normal people. In fact it was aimed at the Tory Hell's Angels who are giving him

such a hard time. They must feel like dysfunctional schoolboys who tweet that

they're going to bomb the airport, then watch with delight as two dozen fire

engines and a Swat team scream up.



Certainly, four hours later at prime minister's questions, they greeted Cameron

with massive cheering and waving of order papers, like Bradford fans watching

their team beat Aston Villa. I noticed only a minority were making the most

noise. They loved his clear unequivocal message: "We are going to leave Europe,

unless we decide to stay!"



As always with a Cameron speech, there are the oddities that bring you up short

even while it flows past you, as if a few inflatable ducks had been dropped into

an Olympic swimming pool. "The biggest danger to the EU comes . . . from those

who denounce new thinking as heresy. Europe has experience of heretics who

turned out to have a point!"



Was he comparing himself to the great heretics? Was he Dave Galileo, murmuring

that the Earth does go round the sun?



Changing the British mindset - we are an island nation - would be harder than

"draining the English channel". But, you think, you can't drain the English

channel. It wouldn't work! And as you ponder that, you miss his animadversions

on the role of Britain in Europe (which turned out to be largely thrashing the

French and the Germans).



Suddenly he was denouncing "fast lanes and slow lanes, and countries missing

trains and buses". It was time to "consign the whole weary caravan of metaphors

to a permanent siding!" So cramming more weary caravans onto one railway track.

Got that?



In the Commons, he abused Ed Miliband for not saying if he would support the

in-out referendum, even after Miliband had said he was agin it. This was getting

surreal. The Labour leader wanted the PM to promise that he himself would vote

to stay in, whatever. Cameron said he wanted to stay in but wouldn't promise

because that would give away his negotiating stance.



But we can guess what will happen. The EU leaders will give him some small

concessions - he's already bragging about new trade ties with Singapore - and he

will bring them back to us like Drake presenting to Elizabeth galleons rammed

with Spanish gold.



Meanwhile, on the radio Tony Blair was comparing Cameron to the sheriff in

Blazing Saddles who says: "If you don't do what I want, I'll blow my brains

out!"



But there is an even more famous scene in that film. All the cowboys sit round

the campfire eating beans and farting at each other. Now that's the Tory party!

So Cameron's going to give us a referendum on our membership of the EU "to let

the people decide" (Cameron to pledge in-out vote on EU, 23 January). A pity

this great democrat didn't give the people the opportunity to decide whether

they wanted this unelected coalition with its brutal attacks on the sick and

disabled, the unemployed and the old, the NHS and public services, and all the

other measures they have taken to make the poor pay to preserve the privileges

of the wealthy who were responsible for the state we're in. The truth is his

stance on the EU is designed, first, as an attempt to plaster over the divisions

within the Tory party and stave off Ukip; but second and more importantly, to

turn people's minds away from the disastrous consequences of his government's

punitive welfare cuts and its incompetence in dealing with the country's

economic difficulties.



Our democracy would be far better served by a general election this year to give

the people the right to decide now on whether or not to legitimise the coalition

and its policies, not by Cameron's attempts to create a smokescreen to conceal

the government's failures.

* What a wonderful contrast. Here in the UK we have a prime minister being led

by the nose by his unruly backbenchers and fear of Ukip to offer a referendum on

leaving the EU, while the French president is addressing a joint session of the

German Bundestag and the French National assembly in Berlin (Paris and Berlin

feeling the 50-year itch, 23 January). Europe has its problems - no political

system can ever be perfect - but co-operation as epitomised by the event in

Berlin is surely the better way. Standing on the sidelines and griping, as

Britain seems constantly to do - under both Tory and Labour governments - does

nothing for our interests. There is no viable future for Britain outside of the

EU. If only we would recognise that and embrace our fellow European countries as

our friends and neighbours. The alternative is to be an irrelevant small island

off of the coast of the continent.

which strongly made the point that simplistic referendums undermine

parliamentary democracy. He was referring to an Irish referendum, but the same

applies to the PM's proposal (Cameron to pledge in-out vote on EU, 23 January).

For a start, a decision which will influence the country for decades or longer

may be made with little real knowledge of the issues involved and that knowledge

may be influenced by who has the bigger campaigning budget. The press barons may

well decide our national future.



One can also easily imagine that some emotive but not very important EU decision

might sway the No camp and, as Professor Newitt wrote, referendums become

definitive and the matter is unlikely to be revisited for a very long time.

Whatever Eurosceptics may say, it seems that their main objection is to EU

legislation on labour and social issues. Under the guise of suggesting that

greater freedom for employers to weaken workers' rights will be better for the

economy, they are, of course, seeking to increase the advance of US-style

capitalism, rather than the more humane version of many of our European

neighbours. For better or worse, we elect politicians to make decisions on our

behalf. We should tell them what we think, but the decision should be that of

parliament.

So now we have Cameron's long-trailed speech on the EU, largely to assuage Tory

MPs and his party, in an attempt to fend off the Ukip threat. It's worth

remembering that the most fundamental changes in the relationship between the UK

and the EU (and its predecessors) have occurred under Tory PMs. These were:

entry into the common market in 1973, under Edward Heath; the Single European

Act of 1986, extending qualified majority voting, under Margaret Thatcher; and

the Maastricht treaty of 1992, which lead to the EU and the euro, under John

Major. None of these PMs sought approval of these changes through a referendum.



Mr Cameron may be following the Wilson referendum tactic of 1975, but he is now

dealing with 26 rather than eight other members of the EU and unlike the 1970s

has no incentive to offer any face-saving gifts. Mrs Thatcher was out of office

two years after her key 1988 Bruges speech on the future of Europe. Is the

London speech of Mr Cameron a portent?

* Eurosceptics talk of an European Union "democratic deficit", yet it's

precisely because we vote for our MEPs under a system of PR that Ukip has put

itself on the map. If we used first-past-the-post for the European parliament,

Ukip would never have got a look in. There would have been much less pressure

from the Tory right, and most likely no talk of a referendum.

The PM has followed his instincts: both to do what he thinks is in the best

interests of his party and to find a unique selling point for remaining in power

beyond 2015. There is always a whiff of a good wheeze whenever big

constitutional issues are put forward by his government. We must hope that he

has thought of collateral impacts - for instance on devolution arguments. And,

first off, "attitude" to the EU may now be a more significant factor in the

Scottish referendum.

Reply: Letter: Support the right not to be a wage slave



BYLINE: Clive Needle



SECTION: GUARDIAN LEADER PAGES; Pg. 31



LENGTH: 287 words





The froth of a referendum will dominate the headlines, but the details of the

PM's speech deserve proper scrutiny even though tweeters may dismiss them as

boring or difficult. We should welcome that he remembered that the founding

principle of the EU is about peace and the wellbeing of its citizens, not just

markets. They are a mechanism, not an end. He is right that some co-operation

and networking can be better than all the complex institutions: we could lose

the economic and social committee and barely notice it, for example.



But the analysis is full of holes: in one breath he wants to complete the single

EU market so that online consumers can have the same rights; in the next he

wants us all to be very different as producers, to pick and choose which bits of

that single market we want to call fair or unfair. The single market reduces 27

or more loads of national red tape and it enshrines rights and freedoms for

people to work, study, trade and earn in ways that would not exist without

supporting courts and mechanisms.



All who support wellbeing must speak up for the much-maligned working-time

directive. Cameron uses it as an example of all that is wrong. In fact it is

potentially one of the finest pieces of legislation ever passed, offering rights

for people to not be wage slaves, to have breaks and holidays. When graduates

are told to opt out of its provisions or not get a post, we should urge its

strengthening, not removal. Also, those who back the EU but want to change it

progressively should stop talking of it as a "project". It is not a study,

political game or theory: this is a real struggle about real lives and rights as

well as international responsibilities.

Front: Cameron to pledge in-out vote on EU: Revise terms of our membership or

trigger British exit, PM tells Europe



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 908 words





David Cameron will today set a deadline to hold an in-out referendum on

Britain's membership of the European Union by the end of 2017 as he hardens his

position on the issue that has bedevilled Tory leaders for a quarter of a

century.



To the delight of Eurosceptics, the prime minister will throw down the gauntlet

to his fellow EU leaders to agree to a revision of Britain's membership terms

within two and a half years of the next general election or risk triggering a

British exit.



In his long-awaited speech on Europe, which has been repeatedly delayed since

the autumn, Cameron will pledge no rest until he wins because democratic consent

for the EU in Britain is "wafer thin".



The prime minister will say: "The next Conservative manifesto in 2015 will ask

for a mandate from the British people for a Conservative government to negotiate

a new settlement with our European partners in the next parliament.



And when we have negotiated that new settlement, we will give the British people

a referendum with a very simple in or out choice to stay in the EU on these new

terms; or come out altogether. It will be an in-out referendum.



"Legislation will be drafted before the next election. And if a Conservative

government is elected we will introduce the enabling legislation immediately and

pass it by the end of that year. And we will complete this negotiation and hold

this referendum within the first half of the next parliament.



"It is time for the British people to have their say. It is time to settle this

European question in British politics."



Last night, Labour leader Ed Miliband said Cameron's speech would "define him as

a weak prime minister, being driven by his party, not by the national economic

interest".



Prominent pro-Europeans are planning to lambast Cameron for placing a question

mark over Britain's EU membership. One senior figure said: "This is dynamite.

This is such a risk - it is an all or nothing strategy."



The prime minister's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on a relatively short

timetable is the "red meat" which has prompted prominent Eurosceptics, such as

the former defence secretary Liam Fox, to express satisfaction with the speech.



No 10 insists the prime minister is not adopting hostile tactics towards the EU,

although some pro-Europeans suggested that Cameron had crossed a line by

appearing to use the threat of a referendum within a relatively short timetable

to strengthen Britain's hand in the negotiations.



Cameron will make clear to his 26 fellow EU leaders that a failure to offer

Britain a referendum on new membership terms would increase the chance of a

British exit. "The question mark is already there and ignoring it won't make it

go away," he will say. "In fact, quite the reverse. Those who refuse to

contemplate consulting the British people, would in my view make more likely our

eventual exit."



Nick Clegg, who has been briefed by the prime minister on the speech, will

reject Cameron's pledge to hold a referendum by 2017 on the grounds that it is

wrong to commit Britain to such a specific timetable when there is uncertainty

over whether negotiations will take place. The deputy prime minister's

opposition means that the draft legislation for the referendum will have to be

drawn up by Conservative special advisers outside the formal government and

parliamentary routes.



The prime minister's plans, which will involve tabling new British membership

terms in a future EU treaty negotiation designed to agree new eurozone

governance structures, may have run into trouble even before he delivers his

speech. Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande agreed at a summit in Berlin

yesterday to publish joint proposals for the running of the eurozone at an EU

summit in June.



The move by the leaders of Germany and France means negotiations could take

place earlier than No 10 had expected. The prime minister will be unable to

table his demands for the repatriation of powers before the next election

because Clegg has dismissed this strategy as "a false promise wrapped in a union

jack".



The Franco-German timetable also raises the prospect that the negotiations could

take place outside a formal EU treaty revision. German sources have indicated in

recent weeks that Merkel has abandoned plans for the moment to demand a revision

of the Lisbon treaty in the face of strong opposition across the EU,

particularly from Paris.



The PM, who has briefed Hollande and Merkel on his speech, is understood to have

accepted that he may have to table his demands outside a formal treaty

negotiation. This raises the prospect that he could follow in the footsteps of

Harold Wilson who negotiated small changes to Britain's EU membership terms

outside the treaties ahead of the 1975 referendum.



Cameron will make clear in his speech that he will be demanding major changes,

possibly including the repatriation of social and employment laws which could

see Britain winning a complete opt-out from the working time directive. Downing

Street sources have suggested that work is now complete on plans by Theresa May,

the home secretary, to restrict benefits to EU citizens who are entitled to

settle in Britain.



Downing Street insists the prime minister's goal is to strengthen Britain's

position in the EU by winning greater support through renegotiated membership

terms. But he will indicate that he may countenance a campaign for a no vote, if

he fails to win his demands, when he says the status quo is unacceptable.

Front: Analysis: Moment of truth for a man opposed to risk



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour, political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 788 words





After a year of prevarication through 2012, David Cameron today finally adopts

the negotiating stance of Liam Fox, his former defence secretary and perhaps the

most senior Eurosceptic on the backbenches. The prime minister's call for an

in-out referendum is a moment of truth for a pragmatic man assumed to be

instinctively opposed to political risk.



Through the first half of 2012, Cameron had dodged and weaved in the face of a

100-strong letter from his backbenchers demanding he pass legislation in this

parliament preparing for a referendum on membership in the next parliament.



He lit the touchpaper with loosely chosen words at a press conference in

Brussels on 29 June when he said: "The problem with an in-out referendum is it

actually only gives people those two choices: you can either stay in with all

the status quo, or you can get out. Most people in Britain, I think, want a

government that stands up and fights for them in Europe, and gets the things we

want in Europe, that changes some of the relationship we have in Europe."



Then in a landmark article on 30 June last year, Fox struck, arguing against an

immediate in-out referendum, but saying: "I would like to see Britain negotiate

a new relationship on the basis that, if we achieved it and our future

relationship was economic rather than political, we would advocate acceptance in

a referendum of this new dynamic . . . For my own part, life outside the EU

holds no terror."



Almost simultaneously, Cameron wrote: "As we get closer to the end point, we

will need to consider how best to get the full-hearted support of the British

people whether it is in a general election or in a referendum. For me the two

words 'Europe' and 'referendum' can go together". From that point, the Eurogenie

was out the bottle.



Yet on 18 July, in a Daily Telegraph interview, Cameron insisted he did not want

Britain ever to leave the EU. He said: "When I look at what is in our national

interest we are not some country that looks in on ourself or retreats from the

world. Britain's interest - trading a vast share of our GDP - is to be in those

markets. Not just buying, selling, investing, receiving investment but also

helping to write the rules. If we were outside, we would not be able to do that.

It comes back to this - who are going to be the winning nations of the 21st

century? If your vision of Britain was that we should just withdraw and become a

sort of Greater Switzerland, that would be a complete denial of our national

interests".



Yet if he was to achieve his aim of a new relationship with the EU, he had to

inject credibility into his demand for that renegotiation, and the only way to

do that is to suggest Britain could leave the EU if he does not get his way.



In his speech today, he makes it crystal clear that following the negotiations

he hopes to hold with his EU partners by the autumn of 2017, he will indeed be

holding an in-out referendum. If he believes he has failed to renegotiate

adequate terms, he will have to recommend Britain leaves the EU. Equally if he

recommends the terms, and the British people reject them, he will have to say

"very well, alone".



His plan has many pitfalls. His Lib Dem colleagues will have no hand in drafting

the referendum legislation he intends to prepare before the election. Vince

Cable, the business secretary, has already denounced Cameron's timing as

disastrous. The sceptics will say "if not now, when ?" Cable will ask, why now

in the midst of a recession?



British business could unfurl the flag of revolt. They might blame every job

lost between now and his referendum on the foolishness of Cameron in putting

party management before the national interest. More difficult, Angela Merkel and

Francois Hollande may not oblige by operating to the timetable Cameron has set

out. They could hold their treaty revision to strengthen Euro-governance after

the German elections this autumn, but before Cameron is ready in 2017. They

could deprive Cameron of a lever into a renegotiation by saying the changes can

be made outside the EU institutions.



They could make the cold-hearted judgment that a strong Europe, including

Britain, is an impossible fusion, and it is best the two sides to part more in

sorrow than anger.



But he will argue Britain has to have this reckoning. If he does not renegotiate

the terms of Britain's membership, the British people will demand departure, so

this is the best way to secure Britain's membership. One thing is sure, he will

hope he again secures the bond of trust with his own backbenchers, at least

until they demand specifics on the powers he will repatriate.

Talk of a referendum and putting the UK's membership of the EU in question would

be a mistake at this time (Comment, 22 January). When the eurozone and the EU as

a whole are making significant efforts to reform and the world economy is facing

unprecedented challenges, suggestions that the UK could leave the EU are

unrealistic and will only cause further instability and uncertainty for

businesses, investors and households in Britain. Global investors, our

international partners and our fellow EU member states want the UK to be

involved at the core of the biggest common market in the world, with a seat

around the table to influence decisions that determine the future wellbeing of

the European economy, of which the UK is a part. Casting doubt on the UK's

future membership while reforms continue will weaken our hand in influencing

those reforms before anyone knows what the benefits and responsibilities of

future membership might be.



The role of political parties is to engage the British people in a continuous

discussion, not least during local, national and European elections, about what

membership of the EU means for the UK. It is our job to address their concerns

and explain the rights and responsibilities, the numerous benefits and

inevitable costs that come with being part of a community of 27 sovereign

nations that have come together in pursuit of their common interests. We should

focus our efforts on doing exactly that.

Front: Tories close poll gap on Labour, but voters air doubts over welfare cuts:

Guardian/ICM survey puts Labour five points ahead No 10 believes public backs

Cameron on Europe



BYLINE: Tom Clark and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 570 words





David Cameron has clawed back ground from Labour, whose lead over the Tories has

been squeezed to five points, according to the latest Guardian/ICM poll.



After three straight months when it held an eight-point lead, Labour has slipped

back two points to stand at 38%. The Tories have inched up one to 33% and the

Liberal Democrats have edged up two to 15%. Ukip has slipped back one to 6%,

after the record showing of 7% recorded by ICM in November and December.



The fall in support for Ukip comes after the political start to 2013 was

dominated by debate in the buildup to the prime minister's scheduled speech on

Britain's relations with Europe. Cameron will now deliver his speech in London

tomorrow.



The prime minister is expected to say that, if elected with a majority at the

2015 general election, he will offer people a referendum on renewed membership

terms of the EU. These would be negotiated if eurozone leaders asked for a

revision of the Lisbon treaty to underpin new governance arrangements for the

eurozone.



Downing Street believes the lengthy delay in the speech, during which

pro-Europeans have intensified their campaign, has worked to the benefit of the

prime minister, who supports UK membership, though on revised terms. A

YouGov/Sunday Times poll found that supporters of British membership of the EU,

who trailed opponents by 21 points in November, now enjoy a six-point lead.



If the new focus on foreign policy is playing well for the prime minister,

however, the Guardian/ICM survey reveals gathering doubts about a key plank of

the government's strategy on the domestic front: the decoupling of benefits from

inflation, which George Osborne announced in his autumn statement.



ICM asked voters to choose between two views of the chancellor's proposal for a

1% cap on benefit rises. Just 36% agreed with his argument that "squeezing

benefits is fair, as wages for workers are also being squeezed", but 58%

inclined to the case made by the opposition that squeezing benefits and tax

credits "is unfair, as it will hurt the vulnerable, including many people who

work hard for low pay".



No 10 has long been convinced that the "striving" majority of the public resents

the "shirking" minority who rely on welfare, and will thus be concerned that

voters reject its argument in favour of this latest social security cut by a

substantial 22-point margin.



Polls immediately before the autumn statement showed strong support for

attaching stricter conditions to benefit payments.



Last night, Stephen Timms, the shadow employment minister, committed Labour to

uprating benefits in line with inflation. Speaking against the benefits uprating

bill, he said: "Uprating should be in line with inflation, as it always was in

the past."



The survey confirms a continuing gender gap, which will also concern No 10. The

Conservatives are one point ahead of Labour among men, by 36% to 35%, but among

women they languish 16 points behind, 29% to 45%. But the Tories will draw

comfort from their strong showing among voters aged over 65, who are the most

likely to turn out to the polls. Among this group, the Conservatives are ahead

of Labour by 39% to 30%.



ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18+ on 18-20

January 2013. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have

been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British

Polling Council and abides by its rules.

Comment: A Con-Lab EU coalition: Here's a real test of one-nation politics:

working together on vital European reform



BYLINE: David Owen



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 24



LENGTH: 637 words





It is a reflection of disarray both within his own party and in the coalition

that David Cameron has virtually abdicated from the debate in Europe by

advocating a delay of four to five years in reaching any settlement. During this

time the eurozone could falter, UK inward investment fall, jobs disappear and

economic growth weaken still further. The sooner there is eurozone reform,

matched by a restructuring of the single market, the better.



The period after the forthcoming Italian elections and the German federal

elections this September would be best to start a negotiating process of reform.

A German government, perhaps a CDU/SPD coalition, will be ready to foot the bill

for helping vulnerable eurozone countries - provided others, particularly

France, are ready to accept greater eurozone discipline. Cameron's timing is not

prime ministerial but party political; no wonder President Obama and Chancellor

Merkel have severe reservations about his position.



In reality Washington, Berlin and London have been as one in their analysis that

to guarantee the eurozone's survival there has to be much greater economic and

political integration amongst its member states. There is an inherent danger,

however, for those countries not in the eurozone, such as the UK, that member

states could vote and act as a bloc in the single market, permanently overriding

non-eurozone countries on a qualified majority vote. This was first demanded in

a banking union. It could develop with fiscal union, perhaps even in a eurozone

financial services union. And it could also lead to block voting on foreign,

security and defence policies. These are not remote possibilities but risks that

would face any government in 2015, Labour or Conservative.



Eurozone reform means the single market has to be restructured. It should

include all EU and European Economic Area states, such as Norway and Iceland.

Turkey, too, should be offered full membership. The key is to stop the single

market requiring free movement of labour for all member states. Free movement

requires a country to reach levels of economic success and prosperity that make

it far more likely their citizens will be content to remain within their own

boundaries. In the next few months a prudent European commission would extend

the Romanian restriction on free movement from 2014 to 2018.



Ed Miliband would be fulfilling the spirit of one-nation Labour - words used not

just by Disraeli but by Clement Attlee in Labour's 1945 manifesto - if he

declared that his party would facilitate treaty amendments in their period in

opposition and prior to becoming, as they hope, the next government.



Some will ask why Labour should be so helpful to the government. The answer is

that, since the 1960s, all major decisions over Europe have been taken, by and

large, through cross-party agreement. International treaties need cross-party

support and Labour will need Conservative support when in power.



Labour, through their friends in Europe, can play a crucial role in shaping

European social democrat policy towards reform, as can the Liberal Democrats in

their party's European forum. Treaty amendment should not wait until 2015.

Labour, Conservatives and Lib Dems can co-operate while remaining free to urge

the electorate to vote to stay in the single market or come out of the EU.

Miliband, not unreasonably, wants to keep his options open for Labour's 2015

manifesto. Cameron has closed that option for his party by advocating a

referendum in the next parliament.



I believe the people of this country want and deserve a referendum. They do not

trust politicians on Europe. But the crisis in Europe is too serious to be left

until the next election. It has to be grappled with now. Ed Miliband has the

chance to act as a statesman.

Eurosceptic Fox gives cautious backing to PM's stance on EU



BYLINE: Andrew Sparrow Political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 7



LENGTH: 489 words





David Cameron won the support of one of the Conservative party's leading

Eurosceptics yesterday as it emerged that the prime minister will deliver his

long-awaited and once postponed referendum speech before the end of the week.



Liam Fox, the former defence secretary and one of the party's most vocal critics

of Brussels, said he had been briefed on the contents of the speech and was

"broadly satisfied" with what Cameron was intending to say. "If that is the

speech that is finally delivered, a great many of us will think that it's a

speech that we've been waiting a long time for any prime minister to deliver,"

Fox said.



Cameron originally floated the idea of using his speech to the Conservative

party conference last year to make a big announcement about Europe. Then a

separate speech was promised before Christmas. After eventually being scheduled

for last Friday in Amsterdam, it was postponed because of the Algerian crisis.



William Hague, the foreign secretary, said yesterday that the speech would take

place before the end of this week. The date and the time will be announced

today.



Given that tomorrow and Thursday have apparently been ruled out and the

publication of growth figures that could show Britain heading back towards

recession are due to be published on Friday, Wednesday seems the most likely

day.



Some extracts have been released from the speech, which will set out Cameron's

determination to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and to put the

result to the people in a referendum after the 2015 election. But it remains to

be seen what he will say about the extent of the renegotiation he hopes to

achieve or the mechanics of the proposed referendum.



In an interview on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Fox, who said that he was bound by

a duty of confidentiality not to disclose the contents of the speech, said he

personally wanted to see Britain revert to a "basic economic relationship" with

the EU.



If Cameron failed to achieve a major repatriation of powers, Fox said he would

vote to leave the EU in the referendum that would follow.



"If the choice for me was between going in the current direction, which, let's

face it, is towards ever closer union and ultimately a greater and greater loss

of British sovereignty, my personal preference would be to leave," he said. "I

don't want to have ever closer union, I don't want to be European first and

British second."



Michael Portillo, a leading Conservative Eurosceptic in the 1990s, told Sky News

he thought Cameron was making a mistake in offering a referendum when he

personally was in favour of keeping Britain in the EU. "To commit himself to an

in-out referendum in the midterm of his next government seems to me to be

extraordinarily dangerous," said Portillo. "People like to kick their government

in the teeth."

Comment: A speech delayed: but Tory EU problems are here to stay: The clash

between the real world and Cameron's imaginary one is startling - nowhere more

so than in his European policy



BYLINE: Polly Toynbee



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 35



LENGTH: 1095 words





The day of "The Great European Speech" finally arrives - and then disappears

again. Due to the Algerian crisis, the prime minister has been forced to delay

it. But that makes little difference: much of the content is already known, and

it is no surprise. He would like to stay in Europe, but only if British demands

are met. Earlier, Cameron had bottled out of his crude plan to speak next

Tuesday, on the 50th anniversary of the Elysee treaty that founded the EU and

celebrated an end to a century of three Franco-German wars. The ineptitude of

his diplomacy has not helped his cause. Country after country has warned against

demanding special British opt-outs instead of negotiating change together for

all. The Finns put it best: pick currants out of the bun and he'll come away

only with crumbs. Blackmail won't work, said others. How could it when Cameron

stands at the exit door with a gun pointed at his own head? They'll shout

"Shoot!".



His posturing provokes a rattling artillery of heavyweight opposition. Obama

sent an emissary with a stern warning that the US needs Britain in Europe, or

else the special relationship is a bridge to nowhere. That shot Liam Fox's fox,

with his coterie advocating a virtual 51st state alternative to the EU. Nick

Clegg and Vince Cable were bound to put the boot in, as were Ken Clarke and

Michael Heseltine. But the CBI's kicking was less expected: "It's essential that

we stay at the table to bang the drum for businesses and defend our national

interest." Another knee to the groin came in a letter from 20 big beasts of

business, including British Telecom, Sir Martin Sorrell and Sir Richard Branson,

reprised this week in the FT. So who has Cameron pleased? Not even his own

fruitcakes who want an in/out vote now: the Bruges Group damns his plan as

"deliberately disingenuous". Which it is.



Cameron's rash promise of an undeliverable "new settlement" may give him a brief

mini-bounce, but Ben Page of Ipsos Mori says Europe - at around 3% - is nowhere

a prime public concern. If asked, people say they want referendums, though in

five years it's unknowable what they would be voting on or why. Peter Kellner of

YouGov delivers a devastating analysis showing the fear factor already swinging

voters away from the exit. Cameron may be making a monumental blunder, looking

weak and opportunistic at the helm of a riven party, instead of decisive.



To outsiders and to history his position will look intellectually

incomprehensible. If he really wants to stay in, he risks voters using a

mid-term 2018 referendum to take revenge, heading for the exit willy-nilly.

Whatever the question, "no" will mean out. Anti-EU rhetoric sits oddly with

Cameron's role as president of the G8 where he hopes to pull off an important EU

-US trade deal that shows the value of operating as a block.



How odd, too, that he should pick on the justice and home affairs brief, just

because it's easy to quit as it's up for review - for most people the European

arrest warrant to catch criminals and terrorists is one of the best reasons for

EU co-ordination. A Labour MP reminded Cameron that 39 paedophiles have been

sent back to the UK for trial. What about "punching above our weight", a

Conservative creed? We waste billions on Trident pointlessly patrolling the seas

to cling to an anachronistic UN security council seat, yet once outside the EU

that seat would soon be gone.



But most eccentric of all, why leave now when Europe is in the grip of

German-led neoliberal austerity, a perfect political match for the policies of

Cameron and George Osborne? That shows how the Tory dance on Europe takes them

to another universe of fantasy politics. That's what the electorate in the real

world, where jobs and growth determine their votes, will see.



Take just one industry: construction. This week the National Audit Office

delivered a stern warning about the lack of public funds for construction in

energy, waste and rail: relying on private money will see consumers paying

needlessly high prices for decades ahead - those very debts to our children

Cameron and Osborne warn against in justifying their cuts. Construction lost

another 60,000 jobs last year, with 20% public housing cuts, road building cuts,

and government promises of investment from foreign sovereign wealth or pension

funds nowhere to be seen.



Simon Storer, of the Construction Products Association, speaks for the £50bn

industry manufacturing bricks, tiles, aggregates and everything for building.

Even the threat of leaving the EU fills him with alarm, at a time when

government dithering on a south-east airport and nuclear power is already

causing serious damage. His industries are heavy energy users, most foreign

owned with no commitment to stay: Pilkington glass is Japanese, cement makers

are French and Mexican, Worcester Bosch is German and so on. Would they stay if

we left the EU? "Absolute madness to risk it," he says. Neither EU working

rights nor planning restrictions hold back his companies: "It's money, pure and

simple." State investment, not an EU exit, is needed to kick-start work - which

could begin in a month if local authorities were handed cash to start road

repairs now, leading to a virtuous circle of employment, taxes paid and benefits

reduced.



I first met Storer at a fringe meeting on construction at the Conservative

conference, holding his head in his hands as a rightwing ideologue said the

answer to roads was to rip out cycle and bus lanes and the answer to overcrowded

rail was to make everyone stand. This frequent clash between the real world and

the Conservatives' imaginary world is increasingly dawning on voters. Labour's

grip on reality will look all the stronger as long as Tory Europhobia fires

burn. The shadow cabinet discussion on Europe this week should, said a member,

have been YouTubed as an exemplary sight of a party expecting to be in power

seriously analysing Britain's future role.



Labour has difficulties: refusing a referendum risks looking elitist and

"Westminster knows best" in an anti-politician era. Immigration is feared. Of

course the EU needs reform - along with a release from failed austerity

squeezing the breath even out of German growth.



Ed Miliband held pretty firm this week, refusing a meaningless referendum. He

left the door open a crack: in these crisis days, who knows the state of the EU

five years hence. But his refusal to flirt with a British exit should see

statesmanship better rewarded than blowing with the breeze of public opinion

that doesn't care that much anyway.

Front: PM postpones major speech on Europe



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt, Amsterdam, Juliette Jowit



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 828 words





David Cameron last night scrapped plans to deliver a long-awaited speech on

Britain's future in the EU after abandoning a trip to the Netherlands as the

Algerian hostage crisis worsened.



Downing Street indicated that the prime minister would deliver his speech, in

which he planned to warn that Britain could "drift towards the exit" unless

powers are handed back from the EU, once the hostage crisis had ended. The

postponement was announced shortly before the prime minister was due to fly to

meet the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, before his speech in Amsterdam.



Some Tories were surprised that No 10 took so long to abandon the trip. Downing

Street had acknowledged the gravity of the crisis in Algeria yesterday morning

by announcing that arrangements were being made for the prime minister to chair

a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee from The Hague today.



Ed Miliband, who was privately suggesting that the prime minister appeared to be

putting the interests of Eurosceptics above his duties to deal with a security

crisis, had earlier said that the prime minister had spent six years preparing a

speech that will cause five years of uncertainty.



Cameron had been due to warn his fellow European leaders that British membership

of the EU could be put at risk unless its terms were changed. "If we don't

address these challenges, the danger is that Europe will fail and the British

people will drift towards the exit," Cameron was due to say in the speech to an

audience of business leaders in Amsterdam.



"There is a growing frustration that the EU is seen as something that is done to

people rather than acting on their behalf. And this is being intensified by the

very solutions required to resolve the economic problems.



"People are increasingly frustrated that decisions taken further and further

away from them mean their living standards are slashed through enforced

austerity or their taxes are used to bail out governments on the other side of

the continent."



The prime minister had planned to brief the leaders of France and Italy last

night on his speech, after earlier discussing what he was planning to say with

Barack Obama after the White House had made clear last week it wanted "a strong

British voice" in Europe. Last night the White House made clear that the US

president maintained the pressure on Cameron in the call.



Cameron was due to declare that he will demand the repatriation of some powers

if he wins an overall majority at the next election. The new terms of British

membership would then be put to the people in a referendum, possibly around

2018.



"More of the same will not secure a long-term future for the eurozone. More of

the same will not see the EU keeping pace with the new powerhouse economies.

More of the same will not bring the EU any closer to its citizens. More of the

same will just produce more of the same - less competitiveness, less growth,

fewer jobs," Cameron was due to say.



But he was given a taste of business leaders' unease when Sir Andrew Cahn, until

recently head of the government's main overseas trade body, UK Trade and

Investment, said: "The chill factor is there, the nagging worry that the UK is

retreating into inconsequential isolation."



Lord Browne, the former BP boss, said: "Uncertainty is the enemy of investment,

and we should be wary of doing anything which tarnishes Britain's reputation as

a home of choice for human and financial capital."



The prime minister was due to say that he supports British membership of the EU

and that his aim is to stabilise support in Britain by addressing concerns about

power amassed in Brussels. He wants to use a major revision of the Lisbon

treaty, which may take place after the European parliamentary elections in 2014,

to table his demand for the repatriation of social and employment legislation.



He planned to identify the three major challenges facing Europe as the eurozone

crisis, weak competitiveness, and a lack of democratic accountability. Failure

to address these would increase support among those who want to leave, though he

was due to say that is not his preference. "I want the European Union to be a

success and I want a relationship between Britain and the EU that keeps us in

it."



Unease over his speech was illustrated in a warning from the president of the

European parliament. Martin Schulz, a German SPD MEP, wrote on the Huffington

Post website that Cameron wanted to set a "dangerous precedent", which might

lead to the "breakup of the EU".



But the prime minister last night won support from Boris Johnson. In remarks

briefed before the speech was cancelled, the London mayor said Cameron should

tell the EU: "We will allow you to use our common EU institutions - which we

help fund - to pursue your project, if you help us with a renegotiation. We

therefore want to complete the single market - which everyone supports - and we

want to get rid of some of the barnacles that have become attached to the hull."

National: Politics: Bosses reveal worries about uncertainty over Europe: Lord

Browne: Cameron stance risk to economy: Referendum pledge likely in delayed

speech on EU



BYLINE: Juliette Jowit, Juliette Garside, Simon Goodley



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 14



LENGTH: 725 words





Some of Britain's senior business leaders - including Lord Browne, a former boss

of BP, now the most senior non-executive appointed by the coalition in Whitehall

- have warned that years of uncertainty about whether the UK will remain part of

the European Union will put off investors, leading major companies to put big

job-creating projects elsewhere in Europe.



After months of silence, executives and the heads of some of the country's

biggest business lobby groups have spoken to the Guardian about David Cameron's

stance on holding a European referendum beyond the next election in 2015.



Lord Browne, who is influential in the Treasury, said: "Those looking to invest

in Britain will find world-class higher education, internationally renowned R&D

and a revered legal and regulatory environment. But it is easy to forget that we

are also viewed by many as a gateway to the European Union. Uncertainty is the

enemy of investment, and we should be wary of doing anything which tarnishes

Britain's reputation as a home of choice for human and financial capital."



Anticipation that the prime minister would announce that a future Conservative

government would renegotiate Britain's European treaty and put it to a popular

vote was confirmed in press reports, despite the speech itself being cancelled

as Cameron turned his attention to the Algeria hostage crisis.



Some business leaders had welcomed Cameron's stance but others warned of a

"chill factor" for foreign investors, of "dangerous" impacts on their business,

and the risk of "total destabilisation" of the UK economy. Several said the

chief threat to the UK - the No 1 overseas investment spot in the EU - was five

years of uncertainty caused by a pending referendum.



Sir Andrew Cahn, vice-chairman of the Japanese investment bank Nomura, spelt out

how potential investors might react: "Imagine you are the CEO of a Korean car

manufacturer, or a Japanese electronics firm, or an American pharmaceutical

company, or a Chinese bank. You have a billion dollar investment to make in

Europe and the UK is your favoured location, as it would be half the time.



"Now your advisers say: we do not know if the UK will be in the single market in

five years' time and have no idea what their access terms will be. We do not

know if the UK will find a sustainable relationship with the EU or be endlessly

fractious. Indeed, we have no idea what Britain's EU strategy is. As CEO, you

are still tempted by Britain, but the balance changes and you examine the

European alternatives more closely.



"Whatever David Cameron says in his speech (now cancelled), much inward

investment will still come here. But the chill factor is there, the nagging

worry that the UK is retreating into inconsequential isolation. Why risk it?"



Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the global advertising and PR giant WPP,

said: "At the very best it (a referendum) will be neutral in impact; at the

worst, negative on FDI (foreign direct investment)."



These reactions were echoed by other key business figures who began speaking out

yesterday. Last night ITV news reported that Sir Roger Carr, the Centrica

chairman who is also chairman of the Confederation of British Industry, had told

reporters that a stark in/out referendum on the EU would risk "total

destabilisation" of the British economy.



Wolfgang Schreiber, chief executive of German-owned Bentley motors, told the

Press Association: "It's acceptable for Britain to keep the pound while the

continent has the euro. But quitting the EU could be dangerous for Bentley."



Some voices, however, welcomed taking a tough approach to a new deal in Europe.

JD Wetherspoon's chairman, Tim Martin, said the Europe-wide pub chain wanted

"proper democracy" in EU countries, where accountable local politicians make

laws. "The idea that we are in trouble if we repatriate democratic powers is

piffle," Martin said. "Let's restore full democracy in Britain and be great

friends with prosperous European countries, with whom we have a lot in common."



And the British Chambers of Commerce said a referendum was essential to

strengthen the UK's hand in the negotiations which many want to see result in a

repatriatation of powers. "We have to be prepared to walk away from the table .

. . otherwise you're lost," said John Longworth, the chambers' director-general.

Front: Cameron under fire from all sides over speech on EU negotiations: PM has

chosen 'terrible time' for Europe speech Renegotiation threatens single market,

warn MPs



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour, Ian Traynor and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 2



LENGTH: 597 words





David Cameron will today come under attack from Vince Cable as the business

secretary accuses him of choosing "a terrible time" to raise the threat of

Britain's exit from the EU, saying the prime minister's strategy "will add to

the sense of an unresolved economic crisis in the UK".



Ministers privately admitted that Cameron's speech tomorrow in the Netherlands

was the result of a mistake last summer by the prime minister, and has raised

expectations to a level that will be hard to meet.



On another day when Cameron's strategy was challenged by some in his own party,

his Liberal Democrat coalition partners, and even his Dutch hosts, the PM

briefed senior MPs on the contents of his definitive statement of his Euro

beliefs.



The speech will include a restatement of his belief that Britain should remain

inside a reformed EU, set out some specific negotiating demands and promise a

referendum in the next parliament.



Ministers hope to include one piece of red meat to satisfy the appetites of the

Eurosceptics, notably an admission that Britain could survive outside the EU.

They concede the Cameron speech may have spiralled out of control, and was

largely the product of an article that appeared in the Sunday Telegraph written

to compensate for remarks he made in Brussels opposing Britain's exit from the

EU.



In the runup to the speech, a group of prominent City figures have written to

the Telegraph in support of an in-out referendum, and a group of 30 pro-European

Tory MPs, including Ken Clarke and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, have written a letter

charging the prime minister with jeopardising Margaret Thatcher's foremost

European legacy, the single market.



The MPs warn: "We fear that a renegotiation which seems to favour the UK alone

would force other capitals to ask why they cannot simply dispense with those

parts of the single market that don't suit them, potentially endangering

Margaret Thatcher's defining European legacy."



But attention is likely to focus on Cable's speech in Oxfordshire accusing

Cameron of a dangerous gamble that could throttle the UK's return to growth. The

business secretary will warn: "It will be difficult enough to safeguard UK

national interests in the single market in an environment where the UK stands

aside from closer economic and political integration in the eurozone. It could

become next to impossible if the UK is simultaneously seeking to disengage from

substantial existing commitments, especially if we are perceived to be blocking

closer integration in projects we are not part of.



"The Eurosceptic calculation is that British permission is necessary for closer

integration - via treaty change - and that this permission can be traded for the

negotiating objectives. That seems to me a dangerous gamble to make.



"There are many in Europe who would be happy to see the back of the UK -

whatever that may mean in practice - and even the UK's allies on market reform,

notably Germany, have limited political capital to spend getting a more

favourable arrangement for the UK."



Cable will say it is legitimate for Britain to seek reforms, but this process

"is not helped by threats to walk out when we don't get our way".



He concedes that a referendum could "lance the boil of suspicion that British

membership is primarily supported by a deracinated Europhile elite disconnected

from and distrustful of the public".



But he will add: "What is clear is that this is a terrible time to have the

diversion and uncertainty which build up to a referendum would entail."

Clegg: Appearing on the radio is an important way to get my message across.



First-time caller: What's your position on the onesie?



Clegg: I'm very glad you asked that. The Conservatives are very much against the

onesie, but we in the Lib Dems believe we are much better off in a onesie.



Miliband: One nation, one nation . . .



Clegg: One onesie, one onesie . . .



Cameron: Can someone tell me what's going on?



Osborne: Sorry Cams, old boy. There's no one from the civil service in Downing

Street at the moment, so I don't have a clue either. You could look in the

diary.



Cameron: I've done that, but it wasn't much help. Just something about making a

very important speech about Europe on Monday.



Civil service: Actually, we've decided it's going to be on Friday instead.



Cameron: I knew that really. Can we rehearse what it is exactly I believe in?



Civil service: This may take a while . . .



Cameron: I believe . . . No, make that I firmly believe, that the European Union

is both vital and entirely irrelevant to Britain's interests. So it is

absolutely right that we should use this opportunity to place ourselves at the

centre of Europe by trying to distance ourselves as far from it as possible . .

Osborne: Total masterpiece . . .



Cameron: And, in conclusion, it is right that the people of Britain should be

allowed to have a referendum sometime long after the next election, by when I

Clegg: Will I be out of a job, too, Daddy?



Cameron: That depends on whether you think you've got one now . . .



Osborne: Just look at these latest figures! The economy is booming.

Parallels with the past: 'Cameron is playing a very difficult game'



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt and Patrick Wintour



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 16



LENGTH: 669 words





If history repeats itself, first as tragedy and second as farce - according to

Karl Marx - then Lord Armstrong of Ilminster is a fine oracle to consult as

David Cameron prepares to announce a referendum on Britain's membership of the

EU.



As principal private secretary to Harold Wilson, Armstrong had a ringside seat

when the late Labour prime minister renegotiated the terms of Britain's

membership of the EEC, which were put to voters in a referendum in 1975.



Armstrong, 85, believes Cameron will embark on a similar course when he pledges

in the Netherlands tomorrow to renegotiate a repatriation of powers which would

then be put to voters in a referendum. "I think it's very alike," he says.



Students of the 1970s have been dusting off history books to see whether there

are parallels between Wilson and Cameron, who both saw a referendum as a way of

dealing with party divisions over Europe.



Peter Kellner, the founder of the YouGov polling organisation, wrote this week

of an "uncanny resemblance" between today and 1975, when support for

pro-Europeans caught up and then overtook opponents once the issues started to

be debated.



Armstrong declines to be drawn on whether Cameron, who says his ultimate goal is

to remain in the EU on new terms, will prevail and win a yes vote.



He puts this down to a familiar uncertainty, this time over how the EU and the

eurozone will develop over the next five years. "I don't feel at all sure of the

outcome any more than I did then," he says. "Europe has come so much further

since that time. I don't know how much David Cameron is thinking about Wilson."

Armstrong, the quintessential polished Whitehall mandarin, saw Britain's

troubled relationship inside Downing Street from the moment the UK joined in

1973 until Margaret Thatcher started to turn against the EU in the late 1980s.

He was principal private secretary to Ted Heath, a close friend, who took

Britain into the EEC, and was cabinet secretary when Thatcher laid the ground

for today's single market in the mid-1980s.



Armstrong was one of the few people to witness one of the key moments which has

parallels with today. He was at Chequers when Wilson took himself into his study

for private reflection in December 1974 after the German chancellor Helmut

Schmidt told the Labour party "some home truths in words of one syllable" over

its plans to renegotiate its membership terms. "For over two hours, Harold sat

in the study after Schmidt had gone," Armstrong recalls. "He was entirely on his

own. He made one telephone call to (foreign secretary) Jim Callaghan and then he

called me in and he told me what he was going to do. I was obviously, having

worked with Ted Heath, committed to Europe. And I can remember a sense of relief

when he told me."



Wilson decided to renegotiate more modest terms and to hold a referendum.

"Harold didn't get what he set out to get. But he got what he thought would be

good enough to say he'd done all right." Nearly 40 years on and Cameron knows

that his strategy lies in the hands of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who

is well disposed to Britain. But, like Schmidt, who understood the need to help

Britain but made clear there were limits, her patience is not finite.



As the man who will always be remembered for coining the phrase "economical with

the truth", Armstrong is discreet about Cameron. But he indicates that he does

not feel he is quite in the mould of some of the prime ministers he knew as he

cites Sir John Major, who secured Britain's opt-out from the single currency.



"I think the stakes are very high and I think David Cameron is playing a very

difficult game. It's a game rather like Mr Wilson had. I think John Major was

clever enough to get the outcome that he really wanted. I'm not sure if Cameron

will."



In his longest stint, Armstrong served as Thatcher's cabinet secretary from

1979-87. Like Cameron and unlike Heath, Thatcher never felt an emotional

attachment to the EU though she remained wholeheartedly committed to Britain's

membership, he says.

TUC raises alarm over Tories' EU demands: Eurosceptic MPs push for repatriation

of powers Unions claim their aim is to tear up workers' rights



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour Political editor



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 16



LENGTH: 488 words





The TUC has accused Conservative Eurosceptics of using their call for a

repatriation of powers to the UK as a smokescreen for plans to tear up workers'

rights.



The union attack came after the Fresh Start group of Tory MPs said their primary

objective was to see the return of social and employment law from Brussels.



The TUC claimed the Tories were seeking to undermine a vast array of labour law

that has emerged from the EU over the past 15 years as part of the creation of a

single market.



Fresh Start's main two targets are the working time directive and the temporary

agency workers directive, but the TUC says there are also threats to the

transfer of undertaking directive, which guarantees rights when one firm is

bought by another, as well as to health and safety directives, rights to

information, parental leave, employment protection for part-time workers and

equal pay.



The backbench group, representing 130 Tory MPs, admitted its call for a complete

repatriation of social powers would require treaty changes, but said the

Conservatives should settle for nothing else.



Fresh Start argues that just as not all EU countries are members of the eurozone

or the Schengen free-movement area, the same labour market rules are not

required across the entire EU.



"We should accept the differing circumstances in EU countries and enable

flexibility for member states as part of a Europe-wide pro-competition,

pro-growth strategy," the group said in its manifesto, published yesterday.



If it is not possible for David Cameron to negotiate a treaty change, Britain

should build an alliance to repeal legislation, the manifesto says.



Failing that, "the UK should seek to negotiate a complete opt-out of all

existing EU social and employment legislation and to introduce an emergency

brake to cover future legislation in this field".



The manifesto, containing a broadly sympathetic foreword by the foreign

secretary, William Hague, is seen by Downing Street as filling in the gaps in

some of the broad demands set out by the party in its 2010 manifesto.



Cameron is not expected to put forward a detailed list of demands to the UK's EU

partners in his much-heralded speech tomorrow in The Hague, partly on the basis

that it is not wise to set out negotiating demands so early in the process.



Fresh Start has no such inhibitions, saying the repeal of the working time

directive is vital because of specific national factors, such as the NHS, and

the different labour models in place across the EU.



But the TUC said: "The Conservatives want a free market Europe without workers'

rights, controls on the financial sector, equality laws, human rights and so on.



"The PM's strategy is that if he can blackmail the rest of the EU into that,

then he will put that to a referendum and seek the British people's

endorsement."

Comment: No more talk of in-or-out. We should be thinking opt-outs: The EU

treaties are not fit for purpose, but leaving Europe makes no sense. Negotiation

is possible without risking free trade



BYLINE: Simon Jenkins



SECTION: GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 29



LENGTH: 1077 words





The stupid Euro questions refuse to go away. Are you in favour of Europe? Do you

want to leave Europe? Do you want an in-out referendum? Do you want to be

Switzerland or Norway? They stumble on through a storm of cliches, about

sleep-walking, club members, departure lounges and minutes to midnight. The

brain softens. The public screams, then it yawns.



On Friday David Cameron is to give an oration, heavily trailed and chaotically

scheduled, to calibrate yet again Britain's ever troubled relationship with the

continent of Europe. It began with Offa and Ethelred, continued with the

Plantagenets, Pitts and Palmerston, and is not over yet. This time the reality

is simple. The European treaties forged at Rome, Maastricht and Lisbon, and

other fields of cloth of gold, are no longer fit for purpose. They have reduced

Europe to an economic mess. The eurozone's 17 members must redefine themselves

against the other 10, and fast. To pretend otherwise is silly.



From the moment in 2003 that Gordon Brown stopped Tony Blair joining the euro,

Cameron's speech was waiting to happen. The evolving euro would sooner or later

need a tight political corset to enforce fiscal, budgetary and monetary union.

Britain and other states would not join this, and would therefore need to

negotiate their relationship with this euro-specific regime. Labour's Ed

Miliband and Ed Balls, party to Brown's victory over Blair, know this well.

There need be no disagreement.



As Cameron and his deputy, Nick Clegg, tried to say on the radio this week,

against a barrage of "pro-European" BBC interviewers, we can debate how soon

this negotiation need take place. Clegg is right that there is no urgency, since

the new eurozone institutions are not in place. Cameron is right to feel he

needs to prepare the ground. Public opinion is getting ever more hostile not

just to the euro but to the whole "European" project.



The referendum is a side issue. A vote now to "leave Europe" would still

necessitate a negotiation, but with the negotiators' hands tied against

compromise. A vote to "stay in" would sabotage Britain's bargaining leverage.

Clegg's attempt to rewrite his own pledge, so as to have a referendum only if

"more powers" were ceded to Brussels, will not wash. The subject is way beyond

the referendum being merely an option.



The euro crisis is thus an opportunity for the most serious restructuring of

political Europe since the postwar settlement. The Nobel peace prize awarded to

the EU last year may have seemed ludicrous, but it set a seal on an era. The

centripetal forces of European union did bring peace and prosperity. They bonded

a continent that had been the cradle of war since the dawn of time. It was worth

recognising the fact.



Equally it is worth recognising that this age is over. Its degeneration into a

currency union of highly disparate economies may have been a mistake, that has

plunged half of Europe into unemployment, misery and depression. But it has at

least precipitated reform. Some countries may feel ready for the disciplines of

closer federal union with Germany. Others, not just Britain, will reject such

surrender of sovereignty. They will wish to draw back.



Few people can really want a return to a Europe of border-hopping, tax-dodging,

undercutting and regulatory chaos. Most are fed up with Brussels' power-grabbing

and corruption, its inane directives and trivial regulations, its subsidies and

tonnes of misshapen carrots and dead fish. Like Moscow under the Soviets and

Washington today under lobbyists, Brussels does the cause of centralist

government no favours.



This does not mean "leaving Europe". In a modern international economy, the

concept as such makes no sense. It means a new deal for a Britain emphatically

outside the eurozone and wishing to relieve itself of the worst of the

post-Maastricht regime. Cameron's task is to replace the absolutism of in-or-out

with the relativism of the opt-out. He may one day have to confront the

consequence of breakdown, but he (and Clegg) are right to protest that answering

such a hypothetical is, at this stage, bad negotiating. Total breakdown is as

unthinkable as total subservience to fiscal and monetary union.



Cameron's minimalist position is to revert to what the rest of Europe found

acceptable at Maastricht in 1991. This included a British opt-out from the

social chapter, later reversed by Blair. Further opt-outs might include justice,

civil rights and welfare entitlement. None directly concerns the primary

objective of free trade. Each can be negotiated ad hoc. Others, such as banking

regulation or the botched common agriculture policy, cannot be dodged as they

involve crucial British interests.



Such stuff can be dismissed as "the devil in the detail", but detail is what

international relations are about. The tragedy of postwar Europe, from Britain's

standpoint, has been the hijacking of a feasible concept - a genuinely working

commercial union - by a grotesque bureaucratic enterprise ridden with

corruption. This in turn was overlain by the bumbling search for "ever closer

union". It stirred the embers of nationalism across Europe. In Britain it

pandered to the xenophobia of an island people.



Cameron has time. This floorshow changes costume every week. The eurozone may

shrink into a tight German confederation. The easier discipline of a free-trade

area may hold increasing appeal to southern Europe and Scandinavia. German

euro-politics, as fierce as Britain's, may drive Germany out of the eurozone,

precipitating the mother of all renegotiations. It is even possible that pigs

might fly, and a reformation blow through Brussels' gilded haunts, dismantling

its directives factory and initiating an austere decentralism.



All thing are possible. Since, whatever happens, Britain must emerge from this

transition newly linked to the rest of Europe, what opt-outs are won and what

are not may prove a matter of nuance. The need to stem European fascism or

communism through political union is no longer necessary or realistic. The issue

is economics and the ending of impediments to trade.



Clearly, the EU might mutate into a political assemblage with which Britons

could never want to associate. That is not currently the case. For the present

the tautology applies: Britain's advantage is to renegotiate a deal with Europe

that is to Britain's advantage. Cameron's vacillations have made this job harder

than it need be. But hard it is not.

Front: PM warned off Europe 'opportunism': Top diplomat says Britain's role as

gateway to EU would be threatened by hardline stance



BYLINE: Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 1



LENGTH: 809 words





David Cameron risks making "premature" and "opportunistic" demands in Europe and

weakening Britain's power in Washington and other major capitals, the most

senior diplomat to leave government in recent years warned yesterday.



Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Britain's ambassador to Washington until last year and

before that the senior British diplomat in Brussels, said in a Guardian

interview that recent warnings by the US administration urging Britain against

staging a distracting referendum was "a conscious decision by the Obama

administration to intervene in the UK debate", reflecting a long-standing view

that it wanted its closest political ally closely involved in Europe.



In his first interview on the politically charged subject of Europe - and using

unusually candid language for an ex-diplomat - Sheinwald said: "If Britain is

active and influential in Washington that makes us more influential in Brussels,

Delhi and elsewhere. Equally if we are influential in Europe, then we have a

bigger impact in Washington and the other power capitals. These things are

mutually reinforcing.



"I just cannot see any logical basis for thinking a move to the sidelines, or

particularly a move out of Europe, would be anything other than diminishing to

the UK's capacity, standing, influence, ability to get things done and capacity

to build coalitions internationally."



Sheinwald also warned that in the eyes of the Americans the Cameron intervention

risked slowing the pace of European economic recovery. Nick Clegg spoke in

similar terms yesterday, telling Cameron not to create prolonged uncertainty

because of the damaging effect on jobs.



The prime minister is preparing to tell his Conservative cabinet colleagues

today of the European negotiating strategy he plans to set out in a landmark

speech in the Netherlands on Friday.



Sheinwald, ambassador to Washington between 2007 and 2012, is the most senior

diplomatic figure to urge caution on Cameron. He was also the UK diplomatic lead

in Brussels between 2000 and 2003, as well as chief foreign policy adviser to

Tony Blair between 2003 and 2007. He is now a member of the thinktank and

advocacy group Business for New Europe.



Sheinwald disclosed that US businesses were increasingly asking about Cameron's

intentions and expressing alarm that Britain, as the main gateway to European

investment, might be closed. He repeatedly urged Cameron to be cautious in his

speech. "British business has been disappointed by the failure of the British

political class to speak up on Europe for a long time, but they have realised

the debate has taken a dramatic turn."



He added: "We have sold investment in the UK on the basis that the UK is the

best gateway into the single market. That is the way we have presented

ourselves. American firms and firms from the far east have based themselves in

London for that reason. That has been such a success over the past decade or 15

years." Sheinwald cautioned Cameron against tabling demands for the repatriation

of UK powers, saying it is too early to know what the rest of the EU might seek

in negotiations after the European elections in 2014.



"To take the position some take here in the UK, which is our European partners

are going to be asking for the moon, and therefore it won't be surprising if we

put in a very large demand on the table - that seems to be at the very least

premature. In any event other members of the EU would regard any really

significant proposals by us to renegotiate as opportunistic, given the main

areas they are going to be examining are ones they would say are necessary for

the euro to survive and prosper."



Anything seen as an unravelling of the single market or the fragmentation of the

EU would be "a bridge too far". He added: "Investors are worried by the thought

that we are going to end up outside the EU by mistake, or without thinking

through the economic consequences or end up with an inferior model like Norway

or Switzerland." Philip Gordon, the US under-secretary for European affairs,

last week urged Cameron not to hold a referendum.



Sheinwald said the White House regards "another dose of uncertainty on top of

the euro crisis as deeply unwelcome". He added: "The idea, if there were an

idea, of going it alone being somehow appealing to our traditional partners or

to our future partners in Asia or elsewhere in the world has been undermined

very significantly by the comments made by the Obama administration."



Britain had succeeded in negotiations in Europe in the past 25 years, and there

would always be efforts to accommodate a partner. But he warned Cameron the

referendum promise "would not be regarded as a knockout blow . . . I certainly

don't think it will mean everyone will say 'fine, they have got a lock on the

negotiations, we have to give them what they want'. There is too much at stake

on the rest of the continent."

Europe: Cameron caught between Clarke and backbench eurosceptic group



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 11



LENGTH: 442 words





The challenge facing David Cameron over Europe has been highlighted by Kenneth

Clarke's description of a referendum as a "gamble" and calls from Eurosceptic

Conservatives for a complete repatriation of social and employment laws.



In the runup to the prime minister's long-awaited speech on Europe, Clarke has

warned that referendums are normally proposed by "hangers and floggers".



Meanwhile the Fresh Start group warns that "the status quo is no longer an

option". The backbench body calls for "a new and different relationship" with

the European Union.



Clarke, the most pro-European Tory member of the government who campaigned a

decade ago for Britain to join the euro, warns that the prime minister's

strategy could end in British withdrawal from the EU. Cameron will pledge to

hold a referendum on a "new settlement" which he would negotiate, if elected

with a majority, when a major EU treaty revision takes place to underpin new

eurozone governance arrangements.



Clarke identified a hard core of Tory MPs who want to leave the EU. In an

interview with the Financial Times the minister without portfolio likened them

to Tory supporters of capital punishment in the 1970s who demanded a referendum

on the issue because they could not command a parliamentary majority. "If you

realise you're doomed in parliament you demand a referendum - that's what the

hangers and floggers used to do," he said.



Clarke is to join forces with Lord Mandelson to launch a new pro-European group,

the Centre for British Influence through Europe. "All referenda are a bit of a

gamble," he said. "I don't think we can take a yes vote for granted.



"I think one of the problems is . . . no one has really campaigned very

vigorously for the case for British leadership in the EU for probably a decade

or more."



Clarke warned Britain would damage its interests if it left the EU.



His warnings came as the Fresh Start group called for what it called four

"significant revisions" to treaties governing the EU. The Daily Telegraph

reported that the group will call for:



* A complete repatriation of social and employment laws such as the working time

directive which imposes a 48-hour working week. Britain has an opt-out from that

aspect of the directive.



* A opt-out from all criminal justice measures.



* An "emergency brake" that would give Britain an effective veto over new

financial services regulations.



* An end to the monthly plenary sessions of the European parliament held in

Strasbourg.



Its manifesto says: "If negotiation to repatriate these powers failed, we should

consider the unilateral disapplication of EU social and employment law in

Britain through an act of parliament."

Europe: 'A Britain on the sidelines is not in anyone's interest': Former envoy's

message echoes that of Washington Warning piles pressure on Cameron ahead of

speech



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt and Patrick Wintour



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 11



LENGTH: 743 words





Downing Street has been laughing off a series of jibes from grandees ahead of

David Cameron's speech on Europe on the grounds that few have had the ear of

prime ministers and presidents in recent years.



No 10 may find it less easy to dismiss an intervention by a new recruit to the

grandees' club who, until last year, was at the heart of Britain's transatlantic

relationship for more than a decade.



If Tony Blair's famous Atlantic bridge, in which Britain serves as a link

between Europe and the US, ever took human form then Sir Nigel Sheinwald carried

quite a burden as British ambassador to the EU and Washington. Bearing the

scars, or colours, from 10 years on the transatlantic bridge Sheinwald delivers

one key message before the prime minister's long-awaited speech on Europe on

Friday. Britain will diminish its influence in the US if it raises questions

about its commitment to the EU, let alone leaves it altogether.



"A Britain on the sidelines of Europe, even more out of Europe, would not be in

the American interest and would not be in the interest of other major European

partners," Sheinwald told the Guardian from New York yesterday.



The remarks are a significant contribution to the debate because they echo,

almost word for word, a warning by the Obama administration of the dangers in

Cameron's strategy to be outlined in the Netherlands on Friday. Philip Gordon,

the US assistant secretary of state, questioned the prime minister's plans for a

referendum and said that "a strong British voice" in the EU was "in the American

interest".



Sheinwald said he was not in the slightest bit surprised by the US intervention

which was the result of a "conscious decision". Eurosceptics, who dismissed the

remarks by Gordon, will now have to contend with the views of the man who eased

the path for Cameron's successful trip to Washington last March. This took place

two months after Sheinwald retired as ambassador to Washington after a five-year

stint that followed seven years at the heart of EU policy, as Britain's

"permanent representative" in Brussels between 2000-03 and as Tony Blair's main

European adviser between 2003-07.



One of the most arduous tasks of the "perm reps" is to attend the weekly

meetings of all 27 ambassadors to the EU, which gave Sheinwald an insight into

the possibilities - and limitations - of EU negotiations. The prime minister is

expected to pledge to hold a referendum on a "new settlement" in Britain's place

in the EU if he wins the next general election. Cameron would use Britain's veto

in a major revision of the Lisbon treaty, designed to underpin new governance

arrangements for the eurozone after the 2014 European parliamentary elections,

to demand a repatriation of powers.



Sheinwald says Cameron should not assume there will be a big-bang treaty

renegotiation that will enable him to table extensive demands for the

repatriation of British powers. "I still don't believe that that process is

going to be anything other than a slow, difficult and gradual one given the

complexity of the issues."



In his lengthy Foreign Office career Sheinwald, 59, witnessed the painful birth

of the greatest example of European integration which is at the heart of the

continent's current pain. He takes issue with one of the prime minister's

central calculations about the euro which is informing No 10's entire European

strategy - that the "remorseless logic" of monetary union will lead to a fiscal

union which Britain should encourage but not join. It is in those negotiations

that the prime minister hopes to repatriate powers.



"I am not disagreeing that there is a remorseless logic about further

integration," Sheinwald says. "What I am arguing about is the matter of degree -

the sense that it is in our interests to make them as separate as possible from

us is where I would part company from the viewpoint."



Sheinwald laughs as he sympathises with Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, one of the few

people also to have served as ambassador to Washington and the EU, who warned in

the Guardian last month that the prime minister is in danger of leaving the EU

by accident.



"Whether that would be the be all and end all - or whether as in Ireland or in

Denmark you would have a re-run of the referendum - who knows? But it would

create a major crisis in the British relationship with the rest of EU."

Eurozone: Financial crisis easing, says IMF chief



BYLINE: Graeme Wearden



SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 28



LENGTH: 206 words





The head of the International Monetary Fund has fuelled hopes that the European

financial crisis is easing by predicting the region will grow this year.



Christine Lagarde said she saw the "beginnings of recovery" in the eurozone,

currently in recession, as measures taken by individual countries and efforts to

stabilise the single currency union started to pay off. "It's clearly the case

that investors are returning to the eurozone, and resuming confidence in that

market," Lagarde told the BBC World Service yesterday.



Lagarde also predicted Greece would enjoy a better 2013 than expected, after "a

huge and massive effort" to cut spending and reduce its deficit. "The country is

going to turn out better results than what was even planned - but it has to

continue doing a massive effort on collection of revenue and collection of tax,"

she added.



Her comments echo optimism from the European Central Bank president, Mario

Draghi, and European commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso. They helped send

the euro up to 83.28p against the pound, its highest level since April 2012.

Traders blamed the pound's weakness on fears that Britain was heading into a

triple-dip recession and jitters over a referendum over Britain's EU membership.

Britain in the EU: Justice opt-outs are a security risk, PM warned: Cameron will

finally give delayed speech on Friday Plans to repatriate powers expected to be

unveiled



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 741 words





Britain is in danger of putting at risk the fight against terrorism and

organised crime if the Conservatives win a battle within the coalition to end

British involvement in a series of European Union justice measures.



As Downing Street rushed forward David Cameron's long-awaited speech on Europe,

which he will now deliver in the Netherlands on Friday, key crime fighting

agencies warned of a risk to public safety if Britain distances itself from the

EU.



The prime minister will move to heal divisions within the Conservative party

over Europe, which played a part in the overthrow of Margaret Thatcher in 1990,

when he sets out plans to hold a referendum on British membership of the EU.



Downing Street was forced to bring forward the speech by four days after France

and Germany reacted angrily to reports that it would take place on 22 January.

Angela Merkel is understood to have told Cameron of unease that the speech would

take place as Paris and Berlin celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Elysee

treaty which set the seal on their postwar reconciliation.



In his speech, delayed by months amid Tory divisions and concerns on the

continent that Britain is moving to the exit, the prime minister is expected to

say he will seek consent in his party's manifesto for the next election to

renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership. He will brief Tory cabinet

ministers at a special political cabinet on Wednesday.



He would use an expected revision of the Lisbon treaty within the next five

years, designed to underpin new governance arrangements for the eurozone, to

repatriate powers to Britain. The changes, which could involve radically

rewriting the working time directive and safeguarding British interests in the

single market as the eurozone integrates, would then be put to the British

people in a referendum if the Tories win the next election.



Coalition divisions will be highlighted when Nick Clegg, who has described

Cameron's plans to repatriate powers as a "false promise wrapped in a union

jack", embarks on a series of early morning broadcast interviews.



The challenge to the prime minister of reframing Britain's position within the

EU has been highlighted by a series of warnings of the dangers of abandoning EU

justice measures. The prime minister has agreed with Clegg that Britain will

exercise its right under the Lisbon treaty to opt out of around 130 criminal

justice measures by next year.



But the two leaders are involved in an intense debate as the prime minister

argues that Britain should then opt back in to a minimal number of measures.

Clegg has said that the police and MI5, which want to retain measures such as

the European arrest warrant (EAW), should be given the final say.



The Association of Chief Police Officers has issued a powerful warning of the

dangers of opting out of the EAW and other measures. In a submission to a House

of Lords EU subcommittee, it said: "Most of the stakeholders consulted believe

that opting out of this and relying on alternative arrangements would result in

fewer extraditions, longer delays, higher costs, more offenders evading justice

and increased risk to public safety."



David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, told the

Lords committee: "My only concerns as independent reviewer are that the UK

should not put at risk its ability to rely on such pre-Lisbon measures as are of

genuine assistance in the fight against terrorism and . . . that it should not

diminish the beneficial influence over other countries' approach to

counter-terrorism that it has earned through the EU over the years."



The Irish government has raised concerns about the impact of tackling

cross-border terrorism. In his submission to the committee, the Northern Ireland

justice minister, David Ford, said that Ireland's justice and equality minister,

Alan Shatter, has raised concerns. Ford said: "I remain concerned that the

potentially very significant effects on Northern Ireland may not be fully

recognised in Whitehall. It is vital that the decisions made are those in the

best interests of all parts of the UK."



Downing Street has said it will do nothing to jeopardise public safety. Sources

said No 10 was relaxed about the delay in the prime minister's speech despite

anger in the Tory party that it has allowed critics, from supporters of the

German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to the former deputy prime minister Michael

Heseltine to attack the prime minister.

Britain in the EU: Cameron hopes to heal divisions and unite a party split over

Europe



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt, chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 6



LENGTH: 1138 words





It is a battle that has created the most damaging divide in the Conservative

party since the Corn Laws in the 19th century. Europe played a part in driving

Margaret Thatcher out of office and it haunted John Major from the moment he

laid the basis for Britain's current place in the EU when he secured an opt out

from the single currency in the 1991 Maastricht treaty.



David Cameron hopes to heal the division and achieve, from a Eurosceptic stance,

a goal that eluded Tony Blair. The prime minister is convinced he can settle

Britain's troubled membership of the EU by using a future treaty negotiation

that will underpin the euro to repatriate powers to Britain.



But Cameron presides over a Conservative party that has radically changed from

the era of Thatcher and Major. Many Eurosceptics have become more strident and

are not afraid to say they want to leave. The pro-Europeans, whose leader

Michael Heseltine brought down Thatcher, barely add up to double digits.



The largest group, numbering 150 to 200, support the thinking of the Fresh Start

group whose members will publish a manifesto on Wednesday with a series of

proposals to renegotiate the terms of British membership. The next grouping,

numbering about 30, want to leave the EU though some are willing to give the

prime minister a hearing when he outlines plans to renegotiate Britain's

membership. The final grouping, numbering between 80 and 100, believe Britain

faces more important challenges.



The breadth of opinion was highlighted by the veteran Bill Cash, chairman of the

commons European scrutiny committee, who called for the re-enactment of a

historic Roman battle with Tory pro-Europeans. "If Michael Heseltine and Ken

Clarke want to take us on over the argument then let's meet them at Philippi,"

Cash said, quoting Shakespeare about the epic battle in Macedonia in 42 BC.

Cassius, one of the leaders of the plot to kill Caesar, says in Shakespeare's

Julius Caesar: "We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi."



The pro-Europeans tend not to match Cash for classical scholarship, though they

believe passionately that he is wrong. Robert Buckland, the MP for South Swindon

who is one of the few Tory followers of Kenneth Clarke on the EU, told the

Guardian: "I understand that the nature of our relations with the EU is changing

because of the eurozone. I am worried that this does not become a proxy for

withdrawal altogether.



"What if the renegotiating package isn't seen as sufficient by a sizeable body

of opinion at home? What if we don't get a renegotiation. What then? Are the

voices going to get louder and louder for outright withdrawal.



"I am not saying we shouldn't have any referenda. But isn't it time to have a

reality check here and to understand that we are talking about people's jobs and

businesses and it is vitally important that the debate moves away from abstruse

legal argument and onto the reality of business and competiveness and inward

investment into the UK. That is why it is important that Conservative voices,

who are robustly in favour of our membership of the EU, are heard now before it

is too late."



Tories in the Fresh Start group take a different view and believe the prime

minister has no choice but to renegotiate the terms of British membership.

Dominic Raab, the Conservative MP for Esher and Walton who is writing one of the

chapters for the Fresh Start manifesto, said: "The basic idea of "top and

tailing" a British renegotiation with a referendum or an alternative mandate is

vital, for democratic legitimacy and to leverage our negotiating position. The

optimum UK relationship would guarantee market access, dislocated from

supranational regulation of social, justice and foreign policy.



"The real question is whether the EU will give us any more than crumbs out of

renegotiation. If so, given the status quo is not an option, Brussels could push

Britain out altogether."



Nadhim Zahawi, another leading member of the Fresh Start group, says the "heart

and soul" of the Conservative party supports the prime minister's plan to

renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership which would then be put to the

British people in a referendum.



However, Zahawi differs from Raab and is confident of a yes vote after a YouGov

poll in the Sunday Times reported a narrowing of the gap between those who want

to leave the EU and those who want to remain.



The MP said: "For the European realists a referendum is a good thing because we

do need to finally nail this. I think there will be a resounding vote to stay in

the EU not to come out. The heart and soul of the Conservative party is in a

place that says let's get a decent deal and put it to the country."



Zahawi dismissed suggestions that leading German figures will block the prime

minister's plans after an ally of Angela Merkel condemned him for seeking to

blackmail the EU. "I am in no doubt that Germany wants the UK to remain within

the EU. Senior figures say it is not an irritant that we are trying to work out

what that new settlement looks like and therefore what our position is. Nobody

is asking chancellor Merkel to do anything between now and her election for the

obvious reason that a domestic audience takes priority. The idea that David

Cameron's speech is seen as a terrible thing in Europe is naive.



"We will be able to come to a position where, when we know what that new

settlement is within eurozone, to have a negotiation that then allows the prime

minister to come back to the country and say this is what we can have -

safeguarding the single market, issues around criminal justice, issues around

the working time directive and then putting it to the country."



Tories who want to leave the EU, some of them supporters of the Better Out

group, regard the MP for Clacton Douglas Carswell as a folk hero. They say that

the United Kingdom Independence Party declined to stand against Carswell at the

last election because he pledges in his election addresses to withdraw from the

EU.



Carswell said: "I think we should leave the EU and have fought and won two

elections on that platform. But if David Cameron thinks he can get some all new

fantastic deal - associate membership - I'm pragmatic about these things.



"There are a couple of absolutes. One is we need to be able to, as a country,

negotiate free trade deals with third countries on our own. We would also need

to be able to say I am really sorry but our law on this issue is going to take

precedence over EU law on something that is really important to us."

Cameron faces fight over Europe as Pickles joins fray: PM to reject Eurosceptic

group's 'nuclear' proposals Communities secretary warns UK may leave EU



BYLINE: Nicholas Watt Chief political correspondent



SECTION: GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 4



LENGTH: 744 words





David Cameron is heading for a battle on all fronts over Europe as ministers

prepare to reject key ideas drawn up by the largest group of Eurosceptic Tory

MPs and pro-Europeans dig in for a major confrontation with Downing Street.



As Eric Pickles became the second cabinet minister to warn that Britain may have

to leave the EU, the government is understood to have decided that it will

reject "nuclear" proposals that are to be outlined by the Fresh Start group of

MPs this week.



The jostling within the Conservative party continued as it emerged that Kenneth

Clarke is preparing to join forces with Lord Mandelson to make the case for

whole-hearted British membership of the EU.



Ed Miliband warned that the prime minister was in danger of "sleepwalking"

Britain towards the EU exit door. "I think it is incredibly dangerous what David

Cameron is doing," the Labour leader told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 of the

prime minister's plans to hold a referendum on renegotiated terms of British

membership. "He is essentially sleepwalking us towards the exit door from the

EU."



Cameron is planning to announce in a long-awaited speech on Europe, due to be

delivered in the Netherlands later this month, that the Tory manifesto for the

next election will include a pledge to use a treaty revision to repatriate

powers to Britain. The new terms of British membership would then be put to the

British people in a referendum after the next general election.



Pickles, the communities secretary, last night echoed a warning by the

chancellor, George Osborne, that Britain should be prepared to leave the EU

unless its demands are met. He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio Five Live:

"If it's in our firm national interest that we should remain in the EU - and I

sincerely hope that is the case - then we should stay. But we shouldn't stay at

any price."



The prime minister is expected to show that there are limits to his demands when

he rejects what have been described as "nuclear" options to be outlined on

Wednesday by the Fresh Start group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs.



These were first outlined to the Guardian last month by Andrea Leadsom, a

leading figure in the group, who called for an effective veto for Britain over

financial services regulations. At the moment these are decided by qualified

majority voting (QMV). The veto would be introduced by formalising the so called

"Luxembourg compromise". This allows a member state to call a halt to QMV if a

vital national interest is at stake.



She also called for Britain to join forces with like-minded EU member states to

bring an end to the working-time directive, which says that no one should be

made to work more than 48 hours a week. Britain has an opt-out. The directive

could be challenged by the "yellow card" system in the Lisbon treaty, which

allows a majority of member states to block a proposal.



It is understood the government will give a favourable response to the group's

proposals to repatriate more than 130 powers from the EU. It is expected that

the report will be hailed for proposing "interesting and creative" ideas.



But the two "nuclear" options are expected eventually to be rejected. One

Whitehall source said of the veto proposal: "There are some interesting points

about mechanisms and, yes, there are emergency brakes in the Lisbon treaty. But

do we want France to have the same powers? Do we want a President Melenchon (the

left-wing candidate who polled strongly in the first round last year) to say he

does not like the idea of Asian financial houses setting up in London?



"You have to think through the consequences of these proposals. How do you

define financial services? They are not defined in the treaties. It is all

single market stuff which is decided by QMV."



George Eustice, the prime minister's former press secretary who is one of the

founders of the Fresh Start group, said: "We have put forward a wishlist which

we think is a helpful contribution to the debate. The government has a difficult

job in deciding what it can achieve in the negotiations. Putting constructive

ideas on the table is preferable to the alternative of everyone obsessing about

a referendum on leaving the EU."



Clarke and Mandelson are to join up in a new group called Centre for British

Influence through Europe, which, the organisation hopes, will turn back the

rising tide of Euroscepticism.
