In her piece on whether Labour should pledge an EU referendum (Comment, 16

October), Jackie Ashley says Ed Miliband shouldn't change position. However,

she, along with many other commentators, looks at it solely through the prism of

present and future electoral advantage, not principle. Miliband has always said

any decision on a referendum should be made on what's best for Britain - not

what's in the interests of David Cameron's Conservatives or any other party. All

those clamouring for a referendum are framing the debate as one of electoral

strategy, ignoring the impact such a blinkered outlook would have on our economy

and living standards. The uncertainty several years' wait for a referendum would

induce will be disastrous for jobs and growth, as companies wait to see if we'll

be in Europe before deciding whether to invest in our country, or pull out

altogether in the event of a No vote. It is these considerations that should be

at the heart of the debate, not short-lived poll bounces.
