Manufacturers are urging politicians to avoid jeopardising jobs and growth by

tinkering with Britain's relationship with the European Union.



In a survey of its members, manufacturers' group the EEF found that 85% said

they would vote to remain within the EU. Its chief executive, Terry Scuoler, has

written to David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, calling on them to focus

on making the European single market work better rather than flirting with an EU

exit.



Cameron has promised a referendum on whether Britain should continue to be an EU

member by the end of 2017, and Labour is considering whether to include a

similar pledge in its election manifesto.



But Scuoler said: "Britain must not gamble on its future in Europe. It is naive

to think we can simply pull up the drawbridge and carry on as normal. The debate

must move on to how we can make Europe work to support jobs, growth and higher

living standards."



EEF members said there was a significant chance that they would shift investment

and employment plans in the event that Britain left the EU, while 60% said the

government should focus on enhancing competitiveness across the single market,

rather than on opt-outs from regulations.



Coalition ministers are encouraging Britain's businesses to look to emerging

markets as part of a drive to double exports to Â£1tn a year by 2020.



The EEF's intervention came as forecasting group the EY Item Club issued an

optimistic prognosis for the economy over the next two years. In its quarterly

forecast, published today, EY predicts GDP growth of 1.4% in 2013 and 2.4% next

year.
