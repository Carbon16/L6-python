The fuss over the EU referendum suggests that many British people want to be

independent with no interference or control by foreigners (ie "Brussels"). On

the other hand, we seem quite relaxed about letting our key infrastructure and

businesses fall under foreign control, such as the proposed takeover of Severn

Trent by a Kuwaiti-Canadian group (Editorial, 15 May). Many other "British"

things are already foreign-owned: airports, electricity utilities, bus and train

service providers, Rolls-Royce cars, Land Rover, the Mini, Cadbury, etc. So are

we a proudly independent people or are we, in fact, quite content to see the

whole nation sold off as long as the price is right?
