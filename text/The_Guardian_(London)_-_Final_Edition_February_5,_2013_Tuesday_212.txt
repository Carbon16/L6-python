* Readers hoping to celebrate tonight's Borgen finale on BBC4 with the series'

creator Adam Price's recipe for roast bacon and parsley sauce that we published

earlier this week (A Borgen feast, 31 January, page 11, G2) should note that the

16 rashers of bacon should be about 5mm thick, not 50mm thick as we had it.



* A Comment piece about the possibility of a referendum on British membership of

the European Union (Labour must back this vote, 28 January, page 24) said

Britain "entered Europe in 1975". Britain joined the European Economic

Community, the forerunner of the EU, in 1973. Its continued membership of the

EEC was supported in a UK referendum in 1975.



* In later editions of last Saturday's paper, the caption on a picture (Filling

station: Birds flock to feeder, 26 January, page 11) inaccurately described it

as a "time-lapse photograph" showing the activity around a bird feeder over a

period of 20 minutes. It was more accurately described in earlier editions as a

photomontage.



* A report about fast-rising sea levels in the Bay of Bengal was illustrated by

a photograph of Kutubdia islanders planting rice, but the caption said they were

harvesting it (Encroaching sea turns islanders into climate refugees, 30

January, page 17).
