My experience as a constituency chairman is that my party is good at seeking

members' views. That is not to say that the view expressed will be reflected in

policy decisions taken, because it will depend on whether those views are in a

majority or minority of those canvassed.



Allegations that the Conservative party is "out of touch" therefore need

qualification. That would imply there is no communication at all. I would assert

that, in the vast majority of policy areas, grassroots opinion is listened to -

and translated into policy. The exception is European policy, and the speed at

which we hold a referendum over whether this country should remain a full member

of the EU. Put this issue in its right context and it is one of maybe a dozen

key areas.



The same-sex marriage furore is, like capital punishment or abortion,

essentially a social rather than a political issue. It is an irritant to many

Conservatives who oppose same-sex marriage, but hardly an issue that will

determine more than a handful of votes in 2015.
